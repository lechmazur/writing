  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns → ledger decoding → mineshaft discovery → final artistic synthesis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image reweights Kaelen's art from "luminous" to "testimony, clear and dark," embedding sorrow with visible material cost (ash replaces pure glass). The cost is conceptual and legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mineshaft revelation transforms the smuggler's motive from criminal to protective, which reconfigures Kaelen's understanding and his artistic purpose. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist works through multiple tuning forks, thermal patterns accumulate, and the final scanner display offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the experiment succeeds and silence is "rectified." However, the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page—"her hands trembling with the weight of discovery" and "her heart full" are labels, not visible forfeitures or altered options. The closure lands, but the felt price is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens through Marcus receiving the package, researching underwater libraries, diving, and restoring the lens. Orientation is clear early (undertaker, seaside, post-funeral package). The closure—lens restored and signaling, Mrs. Hargrove at peace—lands on the page, but the cost to Marcus remains atmospheric ("chased stillness") rather than a decisive forfeiture or crystallized stance. The underwater restoration sequence compresses six weeks and three life-threatening dives into summary, weakening causal texture at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative lens: the bell's repeated chime accumulates pressure as anonymous donations bridge the generational divide, culminating in Lena's whispered "I think they know" and the final image of bonds forged. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (community interdependence earned through persistent care), with cost implicit in the "harsh reality" context and the sanctions framing. One meaningful deepening occurs as the youth shift from resentment to ownership of the runs. The compressed timeline (repeated nights) and cause-effect links (bell → delivery → elder wonder → youth volunteering) hold without breaks, though the leap to "other youths volunteered" is told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied—who/where/when anchor by ~120 words—but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout, wavering between Accumulative (image layering) and vague mystical causality. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias realizes his purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than legible: no prior path is visibly foreclosed, no concrete price paid. The piece never teaches a coherent pattern; the camera obscura method appears functional but arbitrary, and the ending distributes healing to passersby without dramatized resistance or consequence that alters Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: "hedge maze designer" and "living bridge garden" anchor role and place early, but the retrocognitive trap mechanism and timeline remain abstract past 120 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase through hyperbolic imagery converging at the tree of light), and closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Elias destroys the fragment, erasing the wife and accepting the "utterly, beautifully empty" future. Causality is loose—why destroying the fragment ends the trap is asserted rather than built through prior rules. The cost is legible in the final image ("rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty"), satisfying the Accumulative lens requirement for a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early (Kael chained in the carnival center with a countdown), and the vault door opening constitutes an on-page Decisive Change. Causality is mostly linear but weakened by unexplained leaps: how do the chains suddenly become "tools" that press keys, and why does the sequence reverse when "the wall comes down"? The arrow's fletching pattern is invoked as the final solution but its logic is asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the closure turn feeling announced rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (aurora, forge, greenhouse, shipwrecks) and sensory description. Orientation is established by ~120 words (Elias, workshop/greenhouse, aurora night). Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the sound is captured, the forge glows gold, and Elias carries the imprint forward—but the cost remains abstract ("a reminder that even in absence, there was something to be found") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that alters his options. The accumulative pattern holds, but the closure image asserts resolution without demonstrating sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is adequate (station, thief, portrait anchored early). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (golden hour, emerald light, moonbeams as recurring images), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the thief simply kneels, traces, and experiences an insight. The "closure" is a reconfiguration claim (portrait as mirror, not door) but the cost is absent—he walks away with his jar intact and his heart "lighter," a reward rather than a price. No on-page action or forfeiture alters his options; the story tells us he's learned but shows no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (meditation on thawing/freezing via glass-work ritual). Orientation arrives cleanly. However, no meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; Finn begins with a concept, executes it without friction, and completes it without visible cost or foreclosed options. The "abandonment" of the vase is narrated as discovery but no prior stake or constraint makes that pivot consequential. Closure (the teardrop embedding the bookmark) registers as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than felt—nothing was risked or lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who this person is, what "transformative betrayal" means, and why he's in the library remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure unit ("he had outwitted himself") is asserted without showing what choice or renunciation occurred on the page or what cost was paid. Causality is weak: the protagonist "struck—not with violence, but with the seashell's whispers turned into a confession" without dramatizing the act or its consequence. No legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of atmospheric layering and celestial countdown, and closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—the endless night as "full of something" rather than empty. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the opening paragraph. However, the decisive reweighting happens in summary ("his understanding became complete") rather than through a concrete image or gesture that makes the cost undeniable on the page. The "flaking gold leaf booklet glowed softly" offers a visual moment, but it follows rather than enacts the shift, weakening the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words and remain stable. The inferred lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: 734's violin-playing triggers the timeline convergence, and the courtyard thaws as a result. Closure occurs on-page (the timelines merge, 734 becomes "something new"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—"no longer a janitor" and "journey had just begun" tell transformation without showing forfeited options or visible sacrifice. The violin's melting and dawn's arrival offer imagery but lack the decisiveness required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (registrar, forecourt, post-verbal world). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the doodle sequence (broken key → cracked mirror → unbroken circle) and the registrar's decision to step into the forecourt, culminating in the tea invitation and the final gathering. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the registrar moves from solitary polishing to shared silence), but the cost remains implicit—loneliness acknowledged, connection offered—without a legible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. The final image (tea, forecourt whisper as applause, "freed by honesty, bound by silence") reweights the premise yet the price paid is more atmospheric than actionable, placing closure in the Charged Poise neighborhood without a sharp on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—luck quantification, marble collection, and garden decay stack toward a conceptual repricing at the end where the garden honors the gardener. However, the closure unit feels decorative: the marbles arranged by the vine and Elias's realization carry thematic weight but lack visible cost or a path foreclosed. The narrative withholds the garden's agency until the final third without prior cues, creating a retrospective magic reveal rather than earned pattern. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vine's light draws Elias in, but the ending lands as a symbolic gift rather than a choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal sequence—levers activate the nexus, projections materialize, the third lever triggers insight—but the final "proof" lands as assertion rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost. The closure reads as conceptual repricing (time branches at nexus points), yet no tactical price or foreclosed path appears on the page; Elias simply transmits data and feels satisfied. Escalation is present (three levers, intensifying projections) but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Causal but causality is weak: water damage "creating images" that form cipher notation is coincidental setup, not earned progression. The closure—playing the decoded notes, Isabella appearing, waters receding—lands as a sequence of fulfillments without cost or altered options. Orientation is present early (flooded pit, lanterns, antique program by ~10% mark). The ending delivers spectacle but no decisive change or felt price; the musician gains everything (composition, proof, ghost's gratitude) without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly (mountain weather station, post-fever, Elara alone) by the second paragraph. The piece accretes pressure through repeated smudging actions that progressively clarify the "swallowed truth," culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth is named, contoured by charcoal margins, achieving Earned Stasis with felt cost ("permanent twilight," burden now hers to name). The brother backstory supplies causal grounding, but its delivery via summary rather than staged discovery slightly weakens escalation texture.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, tunnel, flashlight, present-tense journey) arrive early and the ending delivers a clear Decisive Change (turning the valve, burden lifted). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layered motifs (confession, pressure, valve, radio voice) converge at closure—but the causal chain is thin: Elias's confession in the car one hour prior is told, not shown, and the valve's sudden appearance feels coincidental rather than earned by prior search or choice. The closure image (valve turned, weight lifted) lands with atmospheric charge but the felt cost is asserted ("empty and light") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or altered option. Orientation Test: who/where/when clear by ~80 words; no penalty. Cost proof: the final beat states relief but does not show a price paid or path foreclosed on the page, triggering a −0.5 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (keeper), where (catacombs/library), and when (indeterminate across seasons) are present early, so no −0.3 applied. Drive lens is ambiguous—gestures toward Accumulative/Textural (sensory layering, lyric recursion) but never teaches a pattern or delivers a decisive tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. No on-page closure: the keeper observes the obsidian's new reflective properties and returns to record "one more entry" with no felt or conceptual cost, no decision that narrows options, and no image that reconfigures prior material. The piece reads as a static travelogue through metaphysical spaces without a before/after legible in choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Maya, Sage Ridge, eclipse session). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the eclipse provides atmospheric intensification and the shared curl moment offers a lyric reprise, but no meaningful tightening of options occurs—Leo's opening is presented as inevitable transformation rather than earned through prior resistance. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo speaks, shares the curl), yet the cost remains abstract; we are told he "finally" connects, but no on-page foreclosed path or visible trade-off charges the final image. The "weeks later" summary further dilutes present-tense closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a post-dream-apocalypse premise but never dramatizes a choice that narrows options or alters tactics. Aria's decision to "probe the mysteries" leads to discovery without friction; the diary pages reveal backstory that reframes the premise but does not create a present-tense reversal. The ending "hint of stirring" implies hope without on-page cost or a legible before/after in Aria's stance. Closure reads as thematic assertion rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words. The inferred lens is Causal (the microdot's transposition drives the plot), but the closure lacks on-page cost: Elias smiles, laughs, and returns to his guise without visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The structure is a single continuous scene with backstory interwoven, meeting scope defaults. The reversals (the keeper's daughter as unwitting courier, the fortune in her pocket) are setups narrated in summary rather than dramatized turns that narrow options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty under the Orientation Test. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the priest "had won" and "stood," then leaves with tools intact and no dramatized forfeit or stance crystallization. The "unraveling stillness" is declared defeated but no on-page image shows what was traded or lost. Under a Situational lens (the priest vs. entity), coincidence (the entity "recoiled," "faltered") resolves the conflict without protagonist agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Ai, glass spire, frozen lake, night-to-dawn) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Ai ascends methodically, layering memory-to-sound correspondences until the dawn chord completes the symphony. One meaningful deepening occurs when the spire's hum responds and the mirrored horizon begins to pulse, reweighting the stakes from private ritual to sensory breakthrough. However, the closure cost—"the effort having cost him everything"—is told rather than shown; no specific loss (voice, warmth, a shattered shell, a visible wound) makes the price legible on the page, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, why he possesses the tablet, and what "periodically eternal" means remain vague well past the 120-word threshold, costing −0.4. The piece declares "fractured timelines" and "procedural generation" but never dramatizes mechanics or causality—timelines collide, the viaduct warps, Kael jumps, yet no because/therefore chain emerges. Closure reads as summary ("the labyrinth was broken… he had lost himself") without on-page cost or a legible decisive change; the shattered tablet and plain street are told outcomes, not felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: deaf music teacher in drum maker's cavern with broken phonograph needle. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered sensory detail (scraping, humming, buzzing) that reweights the numbness stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the "filament of hush" snaps, numbness cracks, and she feels "alive to the world's vibrations once more" with visible cost (the chaotic friction, tearing grooves). The causal chain from broken needle → filing it crude → playing backward discs → physical sensation → emotional crack holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early enough (courtyard at dusk, storm recorder, after being followed). Closure reads as Charged Poise: Elias resolves to act ("he made his choice") as rain begins, crystallizing the decision without showing the cost on the page. The inferred lens is Situational (pressure from the message and the tail forces a stance), but the final beat does not reconfigure options with felt consequence—only assertion. One meaningful tightening occurs (discovery of the tube narrows his evening from passive recording to active engagement), but the ending lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (grotto, starlight, post-energy-beings) but the closure unit—tying the rope to fuse both devices—lacks visible cost or consequence on the page. The "threadwork" resolution is declared thematically rather than dramatized; the reader cannot trace a before/after change in options or knowledge. The Drive Lens remains ambiguous (Accumulative collapses into assertion; Causal linkage dissolves at the end), and the final paragraph summarizes meaning instead of landing an image with undeniable pressure. No meaningful tightening narrows options under a coherent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (greenhouse, shipwrecks, post-fire). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lyra gathers sound, memory, and image toward a final performance that reweights the hush. However, closure lacks a decisive on-page cost—she plays, speaks, and the sapling "trembles" in response, but no path is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The "chronic hush" transforms into "the canvas" through assertion rather than dramatized pressure. One tightening occurs (bowl's echoes shift from loss to renewal), but the final beat ("The song continues") summarizes rather than crystallizes a reconfiguration with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is functional but drifts: "amber grotto at dusk" anchors setting, but the relationship between dealer and chemist (client left hours ago yet dealer communes with residual grief) creates unclear spatial and temporal logic. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—dealer shifts from subsuming to amplifying—but the decision lacks visible cost; the "quiet satisfaction" and warmer grotto suggest reward rather than foreclosure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (static electricity, blotter petal, amber light recur), yet the final tightening comes from an unmotivated internal shift rather than pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents three loosely connected vignettes (symphony hall, meeting facilitation, library encounter) without a unifying causal spine or clear escalation under any lens. The closure—discovering the grandmother's name in a manuscript—arrives as coincidence rather than consequence of prior choices, offering thematic echo without visible cost or a decision that forecloses options. Orientation is present (who, where, when) but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization dominates at the end. The cost-proof test fails; no on-page sentence shows Marla altered, renounced, or paid a price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (marsh-reeds, light, arbor imagery building toward a transformative bloom), but the closure—arbor blooming after joint dedication—arrives through convenient completion rather than earned constraint. The cost is asserted ("ache soften into something whole") but not dramatized: no on-page choice forecloses an alternate path or exacts a visible price. Orientation is clear early. The mythic setup (arbor waits for street artist's tag) functions as quest scaffolding but the resolution bypasses the stated rule (incomplete tag magically completes via "joined effort") without showing how their specific actions bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens: Elias borrows time to reach the Whispering Knot, the giant's stirring forces urgency, and his final action (severing the anchor) releases the echoes and triggers the giant's waking. However, the closure's cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"his borrowed time collapsed around him" tells us consequence without showing tactics altered or a path foreclosed on the page. Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where exactly he starts (rooftop studio vs. terrace vs. skiff), and the nature of the "echoes" remain abstract past the 120-word mark, creating mild drift. The Whispering Knot and the "being" he encounters arrive without prior setup, reading as a late reveal that the causal chain did not prepare.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: months of patient observation culminate in tonight's ritual that reweights his understanding of loss through the vision sequence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that ambiguity is not a problem) with felt cost (he continues experiments but no longer seeks solutions). However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—tears "sizzled" and the glass eyes feel "heavier with clarity yet lighter with peace"—language that gestures at cost rather than making it concretely legible in choice or forfeiture. One meaningful deepening is present but the final image leans explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (Elias in library crawl space at dawn during power outage). A single causal chain links tape discovery → caching → librarian discovery, meeting the one-meaningful-tightening standard for this length under a Causal lens. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elias "smiled in the darkness," already planning the next act, which reads as continuation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that forecloses a path. The ending image does not reweight prior stakes or impose felt consequence; it confirms his ongoing pattern without alteration or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through storm observations, then breaks pattern when Elias drops the tablet and steps into the rain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (a decisive shift in stance) with visible cost—his clinical framework "splinters" and he abandons his data model. The cost is felt: weeks of work relinquished, methodology inverted. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rain trails, amber artifacts, and vortex visions layer toward a final reconfiguration where Elara accepts insomnia as "invitation." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no tactical forfeiture or visible price paid on the page. The vortex sequence introduces images of past convergences without altering present stakes or narrowing Elara's options; it functions more as thematic decoration than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (clairvoyant in cave, following pilgrim) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and mystical vocabulary until the cave pearl触发s transformation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's expanded consciousness) but the cost remains abstract—"recognizing what could be brought into being" describes insight without showing what path she forecloses or what she surrenders. The final image of stepping deeper "to magnify everyday magic" repeats the stated goal rather than reweighting it with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the exhibit assembles fragments across a three-month ellipsis, and the final gathering reweights the stakes through density rather than because/therefore causality. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's dispersed memory finds collective acknowledgment—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("absences could never be fully navigated") rather than dramatized with an on-page forfeiture or visible price. Orientation anchors appear late (~150 words before "ivory harbor" and "ocean-spray archivist" cohere), triggering a modest penalty. The two-shard structure (arrival → three months later) is legible, but the ellipsis compresses all escalation into summary, weakening the felt weight of the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (Q2 −0.4, Q3 capped at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8). The closure—walking away from the open fortress because "truths are in the journey"—is told moralizing that replaces scene pressure and lacks visible cost (the punch dissolves conveniently, no forfeiture dramatized). Drive lens is ambiguous: the arrows and cracks suggest causal breadcrumbs, but the ending asserts accumulative theme without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Application of Orientation Test: −0.4; closure thesis statement in final third triggers additional −0.5 in Q5, cross-cap all categories at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: sensory immersion → memory cascade → transcription → dawn departure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (transformed skeptic carrying "transcribed weight"), but cost remains asserted rather than legible—no specific sacrifice, forfeiture, or tactical constraint appears on the page. The "space she sculpted" and villagers' future peace are told outcomes without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the immortal's dissolution reweights his quest for finality. However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague: "crystalline wall," "escondite," "chamber where geometry frayed" lack spatial grounding past the ~120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—vortex swallowing form and will—lands on the page, but cost remains abstract ("unspooled from the fabric of existence") rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or visible consequence. Linkage is pattern-based (amulet thrums → storm peaks → geometry folds) but the because/therefore chain is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Maya in the prep room with the ink pot, helping Elena escape. The piece follows a causal lens (Maya's plan → guard manipulation → escape), and closure delivers a decisive change (Maya relinquishes the ink pot, forecloses her father's legacy tool). However, the cost at closure feels asserted rather than dramatized—Maya "presses the object back" without on-page hesitation, internal tug, or visible price beyond the gesture itself. The prior "moment of despair that had nearly cost her everything" is told in summary, weakening the ink pot's established danger and thus the stakes of giving it away.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dawn ritual → stationery creation → evening satisfaction forms a textured arc). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Silas moves from charting frequencies to embedding them in gold leaf, and the final image reconfigures his silence-surrounded work as an act of archival resistance. However, the cost remains asserted ("the town's silence had taken so many stories") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off at closure, keeping the closure effect in the Resonant Reconfiguration zone without a sharp felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within 120 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the label becomes "proof of existence"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically legible—no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts. The poison-label discovery at midpoint and the pocket-slip at the end bracket the structure, but the between-work (docker's laugh, woman's call, porter's prophecy) is summarized rather than shown altering his stance beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear orientation (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). One meaningful turn occurs when the seashell points inward and Elias reframes the riddle, constituting a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he abandons his original quest framework). However, the closure relies heavily on abstract philosophical reframing rather than a concrete choice that forecloses options. The cello-memory mechanism feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality—it appears suddenly as the solution method without groundwork showing why this technique would work now when "traditional methods" failed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening and tracks a causal sequence (graffiti network → community preparation → negotiation shift). However, the closure—developers showing "genuine curiosity" and negotiations beginning "with unexpected openness"—lands off-page and is told rather than dramatized, weakening the cost visibility. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing, but the final beat doesn't deliver a decisive on-page change or a felt price; the moonlit chip moment is contemplative recurrence without new friction. Privatization's threat drives setup but the resolution lacks an enacted turn or renunciation with legible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid with closure landing as a Conceptual Repricing (the preserved image of the "last lunar morning"). Cost is implied—commercialization will follow, the summit will be off-limits—but the final paragraph asserts satisfaction ("exceeded his expectations") without visible forfeiture or a tactical trade-off on the page. The piece signals stakes early and moves through setup, photograph, and review, but the chemical-process mechanism appears late and resolves without prior complication, weakening causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (workshop, Elias, drone). The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost: the drone is fixed, Elias smiles, and the ending recycles prior calm without a decisive change, renunciation, or repricing that forecloses a path. The ship's departure functions as ambient tempo marker rather than a tightening constraint that alters Elias' tactics. Under a presumed Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final image ("his artistry immortalized in the hum of a machine reborn") is thematic assertion rather than an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (condensation, phrasebook dog-ear, concentric circles) and deepens understanding through observation rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear early (outpost, frozen lake, Elias at window). Closure reads as Charged Poise: Elias crystallizes his quest and readies to depart with "coordinates whispered by water itself." However, the cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible—no forfeited option, no specific sacrifice dramatized in the final beat. The accumulation does reweight his stance from puzzlement to clarity, satisfying the lens, but the closure lacks the sharp edge of a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—no clear "who" or "when" anchor by 120 words; the tuner is defined only by cryptic role and the town is "a ghost town" without geography or temporal frame until "before the collapse" appears much later. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the tuner's footsteps and tuning-fork strikes layer rhythmically toward the town's revival. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost town dies, a new town is born), but cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, only the statement "his role done." The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0 and cross-category cap at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: by line 120 (~"As their vessel approached...") the reader still cannot determine whether Marina is in space approaching a planet or already underwater, creating sustained spatial confusion that is never taught as deliberate disorientation. The piece declares escalation ("time runs short," "oxygen...dwindles") but these pressures vanish without consequence—Marina completes every step and integrates successfully with no dramatized cost or forfeiture. The ending offers transformation but no legible before/after in her options or stance; she becomes "the new distress signal sender" via summary assertion rather than a visible decisive change, renunciation, or image that reweights prior material. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout (spatial exploration? consciousness merger? mentor quest?) and does not cohere at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric overlay. Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, Elias, copper sunset) arrive early. The escape sequence follows because/therefore logic: decode scratches → position lattice → wall yields → climb toward beacon. Closure is a Decisive Change (physical escape) but the cost feels deferred—"they would find" and "he would be miles away" are future-tense promises rather than on-page stakes paid. The warden's approach in paragraph five creates mild tension but dissipates immediately as Elias is already threading away.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: the bead "clatters to the floor," she fades, and he whispers her name—no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization that forecloses a path with felt consequence. The final assertion "he knew, beyond all doubt, that she would return" tells future intent rather than landing a present reconfiguration. Under a causal lens, the botanist's memory surfaces unbidden and the bead "flares" without his agency; under accumulative logic, the final image recycles earlier descriptors without reweighting them. The debt is declared "paid" but no visible price alters his present options or emotional state on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (sleepwalking paths accumulate sensory density until the weaving act reweights the premise). Orientation anchors arrive late—"poetic wharf weaver" and "Elara" are named, but the red canyon labyrinth materializes abruptly in paragraph two without spatial grounding from the shore. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the weaving transforms ruin into beauty), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; we're told the labyrinth "would never be the same" without showing what Elara forfeited or how her options narrowed. The narrative compresses transit and discovery efficiently, yet the because/therefore linkage between empty tides and labyrinth access is mystic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is prompt (who, where, when by line three). The closure unit—sundial base sliding into socket—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes meaning with felt cost (decades of diaspora resolved). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered backstory, the excavation deepens symbolic weight, and the final click reweights all prior material. One minor slip: the "faint light, cool and silver" emanating from the seam introduces a rule change (magic becomes literal) that was not cued or constrained earlier, blurring whether this is metaphor or world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    No discernible closure effect—Elliot performs the same ritual he performs "each morning" and the cycle "will begin anew," confirming pure stasis without visible cost or renunciation. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; the "letter waiting in his satchel" never escalates to a choice that narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until multiple paragraphs in), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The Drive Lens reads as intended Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece fails the Orientation Test: by 120 words we know only "cobalt observatory" and "Elias embroidering," with no anchored when, why, or what the conspiracies are. The ending offers no legible closure—Elias finishes his work, the coup is "postponed by a thread," and he leaves with "his work done, for now," which reads as a pause rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with cost. The dominant lens is ambiguous (oscillates between causal embroidery-as-magic and accumulative mood) and never coheres. Applied penalties: Orientation Test −0.4, lens ambiguity −0.4, no legible closure cost −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shard warms, spirits crescendo, words form in condensation—but no action narrows options or creates a fork. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology released, "peace" achieved), but the cost is abstract: we see no price paid by the medium, no path foreclosed, only atmospheric resolution. The "moment before deciding" promised in the timeframe never materializes as an on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (mist-clad atrium, Elias on bench, anesthetic kicking in) arrive within the first 120 words; drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-building around coral, mist, and the cast notes. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias reframes his pain as "a map, a direction toward something like peace," and the coral fragment pulses a final acknowledgment before settling still, reconfiguring his wound into potential solace. Cost is felt in the return of physical pain and the dissolution of the girl's presence, but remains more emotional than causal—the ache is reframed rather than paid. The middle deepens through the decryption beat, but escalation is textural rather than a clear narrowing of options, and the girl's vanishing avoids testing the new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the resurrection of the orchard, then recedes in a mirrored fade. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara accepts the transience of her vision—but the cost is asserted ("purpose fulfilled") rather than dramatized with a forfeited option or visible price. Orientation anchors early (ruined orchard, fog, Elara's role). The single tightening (light ritual) deepens texture but does not narrow options or force a trade-off, limiting closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who and where by ~80 words (chapel, mural restorer, hobo nickel), satisfying the orientation test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the sound wave garden accumulates sensory density and conceptual layers, and the return to the chapel reconfigures her perception of the mural. However, closure offers resonant repricing without visible cost—she picks up her brush "with a new curiosity," but no prior option is foreclosed and no felt price is paid on the page. The nested structure (chapel → garden → chapel) is legible, but the garden sequence functions as an extended metaphor rather than a causal or pressure-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Situational pressures (the Thought Tax world forces underground tactics). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wildflower with cryptic symbols survives the raid, Silas smiles, the rebellion persists. The cost is implied (garden destroyed, risk ongoing) but not felt on the page as a foreclosed option—Silas ends exactly where he began, unaltered. Orientation anchors arrive late: "Thought Tax made sincerity a capital crime" and the greenhouse location emerge organically, but "after thoughts became taxable" is glossed rather than dramatized as a constraint. The causal chain (form club → plant messages → Enforcers raid → wildflower persists) links cleanly, but the weeks-later jump elides the middle escalation, and the wildflower's overnight bloom reads convenient rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—spatial grounding (cliff, shell, sea) arrives piecemeal without early anchoring—triggering the Q2 penalty. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the blossom's arrival and pain's transformation, but cost is asserted rather than demonstrated: pain "dissolves" into light without any visible forfeiture or decision that forecloses a path. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (centuries of longing, recurring motifs), yet the ending delivers a convenience resolution—the blossom appears, solves the poet's suffering, and promises continuation—undercutting earned closure. The new postcard ("The next chapter is yours") reads as a soft reset rather than reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and recurrent images (orchids, song, regret) and offers a closure effect via Charged Poise—the final paragraph crystallizes the caretaker's endless cycle with the line "how long could one person hold the weight of so many ghosts?" followed by the resumption of work. However, cost at closure is asserted more than shown; the caretaker "felt a little emptier" after the locket, but no specific capability or memory is forfeited on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The two-problem structure (chime, then locket) functions as repetition rather than escalation, satisfying accumulative design but lacking a decisive tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting baseline expectations. However, closure fails the cost test: the glass ink well shatters and "he" appears in a moment of declared success with no visible price paid or option foreclosed. The story tells us "the promises held" and "their paths converged" without showing what was risked or lost in the act. The drive lens appears Causal but the final beat offers convenience rather than consequence—no before/after legible through dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph, meeting baseline. However, the closure unit—"he would recalibrate the floodgate...to harmonize"—is a decision announced in summary with no on-page enactment, altered tactics, or visible cost at the moment of choice. The "encrypted compassion" discovery via analyzer and chain measurement feels like a puzzle solved rather than a pressure that narrows options. The inferred lens (Causal) expects because/therefore linkage to a closure choice, but the ending delivers declaration without dramatized consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote observation, pigeon ritual, and meteorite handling build density toward the bird's launch, which functions as Charged Poise—options crystallize (trust in his method vs. paralysis) and the cost (releasing the fragment of his sister into uncertainty) is felt in "a living line of flight carrying a dead song." Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph. The escalation is a single tightening (attachment and release) rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for this length and lens, and the closure image reweights prior material (dust, flight, preservation) with undeniable emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elea is and what the prism terrace means emerge slowly through ~200 words of atmospheric drift. The dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—resolves via epiphany ("she realized with sudden clarity") rather than causal pressure. The piece attempts Accumulative mode but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift; the final image recycles "featherly determined" and restates the premise without reweighting prior material or making cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors are present (underwater facility, midnight, Elara's role) but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—part causal discovery (burnt feather → mechanism), part accumulative texture (plankton patterns), part situational wonder. The closure attempt is Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara "finally learned...the rhythm of belonging"), yet the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The "burnt feather...left behind by the original lead researcher" reveal at the end is retroactive information dump, not dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a single-POV accumulative pattern: Aelia sorts seeds, watches colors, and arrives at a discovery. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "when" remains vague beyond "three cycles of the migrating birds." The closure—realization that paths are deliberately emptied—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and felt at a remove; no prior choice or tactic is altered, and the "more questions than it solved" line deflates the stakes. Under an Accumulative lens the deepening is modest (red/blue/gold seeds → empty circles → pattern → image), but no visible price forecloses a path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a weak RR; the ending gestures toward cost ("already anticipating another year") without dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elias orchestrates serendipity, and the clock-unlocking completes his plan. Orientation anchors quickly (arcade, stars, crowd, Elias). However, the closure lacks felt cost—the plan succeeds exactly as intended, the crowd applauds, and no path is foreclosed; the bishop's "purpose fulfilled" line tells completion rather than showing a price paid. One meaningful tightening occurs (note → clock → unlock sequence), but the woman's key solves a problem introduced only moments earlier, weakening causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph and remain stable. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation/fledging as Earned Stasis variant), but the closure unit lacks visible cost—Lyra's "spontaneously anchored connection... began to loosen" is stated, not dramatized with a price paid on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mystical density building to transformation), yet the final image delivers assertion ("carrying the verse that would remake reality") rather than a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights prior material with felt consequences. No clear on-page cost is legible at the ending beat (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. However, no closure unit materializes: the protagonist tosses a stone, receives seven insights passively, then walks away with his heart already "light" and "clear"—no decisve change, no path foreclosed, no felt cost. The ripples function as a checklist of observations (fisherman, seagulls, daughter, storm, town, self, smallness) without narrowing options or reweighting stakes. The ending's claim that he "captured" the sacred is asserted, not dramatized through an on-page turn or reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through reflection anchored by the box, bell, and moonlit setting. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias reframes his relationship to trauma), but the cost is asserted rather than legible: "his internal mapping had been redrawn" tells the change without showing a foreclosed option or visible price. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early, but the ending remains declarative rather than charged by image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece orients who and where by the opening lines but lacks a legible drive lens; the gauge reacts, water glows, patterns shift, yet no causal because/therefore chain tightens options or knowledge. The closure image—gauge pointing skyward, heart "light as a balloon"—offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; Elara completes her trial and walks out satisfied, rendering the ending a summary rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The parallel-timelines frame is invoked repeatedly but never constrains a choice or complicates a beat on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—ivy-veiled passage, manor, fireplace, chamber accumulate without a stable anchor until well past 120 words; apply −0.4. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images and mood shifts), but closure lacks a decisive reweighting: Elian walks away feeling "chosen" and vowing to return, which defers consequence rather than landing it. The film negative's revelation (the woman was also a cartographer) arrives as summary exposition, not a turn that narrows options. Cost is asserted ("legacy's burden") but not made visible in a forfeited path or altered state.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the painter performs a ritual, the mirage coalesces, and dissolves as bells ring. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (terrace, spring, prism parapet). However, closure is Resonant Reconfiguration by patterned recursion—the final image reweights prior material through the girl's reflection and the promise of return—but the cost remains abstract and deferred ("she would return tomorrow"). The ending offers charged poise without on-page forfeiture or a visible path closed, landing at the threshold of a meaningful tightening but not crossing it decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (ancient terrace), and when (midsummer) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: density builds through the ritual of naming, and the final image reconfigures his stance from negotiator to "keeper of memories." However, the cost at closure is largely asserted ("the weight of the clipboard seemed to lift") rather than concretely shown—no dramatized forfeiture or visible consequence that alters his options beyond the ritual itself. The resonant reconfiguration is present but the felt price remains abstract, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by line 1, but "when" remains vague (timeframe is atmospheric, not concrete). The piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the egg converts to resonance waves preserved in salt crystals, a final image that reweights extinction with cost (the bird will never truly return). However, the cost is conceptual and abstract—no visible forfeiture that changes Silas's options on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of backstory and lyric detail reweights the premise), but the final beat ("walked away leaving nothing but footprints") deflates rather than charges, undercutting closure strength.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is vague: we never learn who she is beyond the label, where the courtyard sits in time or space, or what "chaste courtesan" means in this world (−0.4 in Q2 for unclear anchors past ~120 words). The closure—untangling threads and walking away whole—occurs on the page, but cost is declared rather than dramatized: "she was whole" tells the change without showing a forfeited path or visible price. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes and threads reweighting her stance), but the pattern is introduced late and resolved in a single sequence without earlier causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story opens with an off-page argument, delaying anchors (who argued? about what specifically?) past the 120-word mark and violating the Orientation Test; applying −0.4. The structure is a montage across weeks and locations (dome, bars, final performance) without clear transitions or a single scene window, yet no taught mosaic pattern emerges by the first quarter to guide accumulation. The closure—puppets with cut strings—reads as metaphor rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; Elias's stance at the end ("uncommonly serene once more") mirrors the opening with no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Under an attempted Accumulative lens, no cadence break or density spike charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early (grotto, Elias, monarch migration, twilight). The dominant stake—honoring the last monarchs through a temporary structure—is signaled and pursued, but no meaningful tightening or reversal occurs: Elias begins building, continues building, completes the structure, and leaves as planned. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the signal sent "received perhaps, by no one but the sky"), but the conceptual cost is asserted in reflection rather than demonstrated through a dramatized choice or forfeiture. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density does not meaningfully shift at the ending; the final paragraphs repeat the premise rather than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "decades" and "years since he'd forgiven himself" create timeline confusion. The closure—names "transcribed forever" into rope fibers—occurs but the cost is asserted ("guilt dissolve") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited path or visible trade-off. Causal lens attempt fails: the punched card's "holes aligning with rope strands like a key" is metaphor without mechanics, and the aurora's participation reads as convenient magic rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph (Kael, vine-draped bunker, approaching storm). The inferred lens is Causal: Kael's foresight enables preventive micro-actions, the wafer seal's decay escalates the directive's failure, and his mental intervention restores the core logic in a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of his nature) with conceptual cost legible in "He was not chosen; he was created by necessity," which forecloses the path of questioning and reprices his burden as identity. The tightening is meaningful but compressed—the plunge into the dreamscape and the healing occur in rapid succession without intermediate setbacks, slightly softening the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening ~100 words, satisfying the test. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV and attempts an Accumulative lens: Elias prepares tools, aligns the tile with stars, presses his palm, and seals the covenant. The closure unit aims for Conceptual Repricing (the encrypted devotion becomes part of him, "they counted him among their own"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, altered tactic, or visible sacrifice accompanies the final image. The tightening is atmospheric (constellations shift, numbers glow) without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "soundless sanctuary" and "reality shifted" but lack concrete spatial grounding or a legible stake for Elias until well past the opening. The structure is a repetitive loop—Elias extends box, visitor resists briefly, music plays three notes, tears fall, visitor leaves, box reappears—with no escalation or tightening across six iterations. No decisive change occurs; the final paragraph recycles the opening premise ("music box reappeared yet again") without transformation or cost. The ending offers summary assertion ("This was his purpose") rather than an on-page closure unit that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (boundaries erased/drawn at will) with conceptual cost implied but not made visceral on the page. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fog, glass, breath, and mirror shards pattern toward the dome moment. The runaway dream's return lacks causal grounding—it appears "through invitation" without prior friction or dramatized pursuit that would make the erasure of "hunter and hunted" boundaries legible as a fought transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mender layers relics (ribbon, seed, key, candle) into soil, building density toward a final image of the orchard as bridge. Orientation anchors quickly (cathedral rafters, post-breach timeframe). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the planted seed and imagined daughter's return crystallize options, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharply legible—no specific path is foreclosed on the page, only a quiet assertion of persistence. One meaningful deepening occurs (planting becomes bridge-building), sufficient for this length, but the final beat lacks a decisive on-page price that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece opens with acceptable orientation (Margaret, desk, morning) but immediately drifts into nonlinear abstraction ("would inherit it next Tuesday, or perhaps had inherited it last year") that becomes a structural tic rather than a taught pattern. The astral orchard visits occur without causal linkage—she "stood" there, "found herself back"—erasing agency and because/therefore progression. The ending offers thematic summary ("nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or gift but simply complicated existence itself") rather than a decisive on-page change with felt cost. No meaningful tightening forecloses an option; the closure is conceptual assertion, not a legible reconfiguration anchored in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara breaks the spell, and they leave "the quiet hum of potential forever imprinted on their Hearts." The cost is conceptual and felt—Kael's "sorrowful, terrible understanding" and the imprint of lost potential. Orientation anchors are present early (Archives, the diary, the mountain bookstore). The causal lens holds: diary clues → gap research → linguistic address → breakthrough. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the diary is *from* the library, not just *to* it, which narrows her method and charges the final act. The closure cost is legible but somewhat abstract ("imprinted on their Hearts"); a more concrete forfeiture or visible change in stance would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early but "chimera twin discoverer" remains abstract. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into summary sequencing without causal pressure or pattern-taught compression. Closure lacks visible cost: the twin "feels whole" and finds peace, but no prior path is foreclosed on the page—what did they renounce or pay? The garden's appearance and the chimera's merge happen by assertion, not earned through protagonist agency or a resonant reconfiguration with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: door appears → seal unlocks it → platform and rope puzzle → reconfiguration merges doors and returns library stories. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land early. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (library rejoins world, door becomes iron again), but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than felt—Elias smiles with "clarity hard-won" yet no visible forfeiture or trade-off appears on the page. The inferred lens is Causal, held consistently, but the final beat lacks the undeniable price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mapkeeper traces cracks, finds the right configuration, activates the stone, and achieves the bloom of hush—a coherent tightening via density increase and pattern convergence. However, the closure is Earned Stasis (the bloom holds, the work continues) without a visible cost that forecloses a path on the page; the final lines assert renewal and satisfaction rather than demonstrating a trade-off or loss. The causality is present but the felt cost at closure remains abstract ("would fade" is future-tense, not paid now), preventing the closure unit from landing with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Kaelen observes star paths, adjusts the prism, and the beam fires—density increases toward the climactic light. However, closure cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "the weight of his success" and "hope through its very imperfections" tell the reader the outcome without showing a visible price paid or option foreclosed. The shard of hush concept is introduced late (mid-story) and resolves the technical problem it did not help create, weakening causal earn.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and shifts from observation to understanding, landing on Kael's realization that collective memory lives in the stormlit air. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (his role "settles like a mantle"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or altered tactic. The fog-lifting and whispers-gone beats suggest a before/after, yet the stakes never narrow options with felt pressure. Orientation is clean early (observatory, Kael, fog-trapped world).

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and follows an accumulative/textural lens: chant → mosaic discovery → fire-spinner's knot reveals complete message. However, the closure unit is a thematic statement ("hopelessness is merely the absence of created light") delivered as exposition rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The final image—Marlo walking away with "renewed purpose"—lacks a visible price or foreclosed option; the wanderer arrives troubled and leaves healed without dramatized trade-off. The causal chain (arrive, chant, discover, ignite, realize, depart) reads clearly but the ending summarizes theme rather than reweighting prior material through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through tidal-pool imagery and sustains it to closure. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (grotto, Elian, Mara, the pause). The closure operates as Charged Poise: the final beat crystallizes the readiness to receive the difficult conversation with undeniable pressure, and the cost is felt in "something ending so something else might begin." The lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian's extended reflection on transition finally enables both characters to enter the conversation's proper cadence, though the cost could be more concretely tied to a specific forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes a mystical collection ritual and delivers Elara's ascent, but causality is vague—gravity inverts on schedule, the trellis appears, and she floats up without obstacle or tactical adjustment. The closure image (doll cooling, secrets kept) offers resonance but no legible cost: she has collected what she sought and returns unchanged in options or knowledge. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the final cadence reweights prior imagery, but the weight of "stolen quiet" and "gilded hush" remains decorative rather than felt as a trade-off or forfeiture. The Orientation Test: who, where, when are anchored by line three; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation (who/where) arrives by ~80 words, satisfying the test. However, the closure unit is a told assertion ("she had succeeded," "The quiet remained, now a comfort") without visible cost or change in options on the page. The piece lacks causal linkage: Elara's actions (placing the vial, monitoring) produce the result through summary declaration rather than dramatized consequence. The final third repeats the same resolution in near-synonym loops ("work was done," "purpose served," "silence was kind") without deepening or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a linear sequence of discoveries without meaningful causal pressure or escalation. Elias encounters no reversals; each obstacle (guards, waterfall, paint layers) dissolves immediately upon approach. The "unclaimed throne" functions as a told-about MacGuffin rather than an on-page stake that narrows options. The ending offers thematic summary and distant future-tense narration instead of a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed—the reader does not have clear spatial or temporal grounding until well past 120 words; "three years ago" and "ashen charcoal sanctuary" arrive late and without concrete anchors. The closure moment (raising the ring to "bridge the gap") reads as Charged Poise, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("risk being unable to breathe yourself") rather than felt through prior failed attempts. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final tightening does not emerge from density increase or cadence shift but from a declarative epiphany. Causality is present but thin: the encroaching presence is drawn by her methods, yet we never see her use those methods on the page in a way that demonstrates their mechanics or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads Causal: glitchy texts guide Leo → bolt into soil → diamonds appear. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Leo walks away lighter, the wound closed, with no foreclosed path or visible sacrifice on the page. The bolt's mechanics (why this object, why here, why now) remain unexplained; causality is asserted rather than dramatized. The ending summarizes transformation ("a survivor no longer defined by his past") instead of showing a decisive choice or resonant reconfiguration with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: standing waves intensify, shadows deepen, images layer toward the final realization that ancestors built a prison. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—"the hidden truth revealed itself: his ancestors had not built a dynasty but a prison"—but the cost remains abstract and told rather than felt in a concrete choice or image. The final paragraph summarizes resolution ("the weight of his lineage lifted") without an on-page decisive act or visible price, weakening closure legibility under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The closure unit (unsnapping the gear → dawn shatters endless night) lacks visible cost: the knight suffers no loss, makes no trade-off, and the transformation happens to him rather than through a choice that narrows options. Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reconfigures the stake with felt price. The gear's removal functions as a mechanical trigger without dramatized consequence that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (archivist, file room, "after the emancipation"). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elias traces one button through marginal notes, building density toward the final reweighting ("network of these small, bright moments"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archival sleeve and his altered perception crystallize a before/after with felt cost (his heart "more bearable"). Causality is clean; the cost is emotional and opportunity-based (he will not return the button), legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening (Maya at the Ministry) and delivers closure: the broadcast plants "seeds of doubt" and Maya returns to her maintenance cover with continued vigilance. However, the ending reads as thematic assertion rather than a dramatized shift in options or cost—"seeds of doubt" and "continue to appear" are told outcomes, not shown consequences. The escalation follows a causal chain (missed check-ins → contingency protocol → broadcast → alarm), but the broadcast itself unfolds without resistance or tactical adjustment, flattening the pressure curve. The inferred lens is causal-situational hybrid; the closure leans toward Conceptual Repricing (the broadcast reweights public memory), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract rather than viscerally anchored in Maya's present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear situational stake—prevent the final prophesied note—and delivers a resolution: Elias succeeds, birdsong carries normal tunes. However, the closure is told rather than shown; we learn "he felt the shift" and infer success from absence, not from a visible action or image that reconfigures prior material with legible cost. The piece operates in a situational/accumulative hybrid (ritual pressure, pattern disruption), but the final beat does not crystallize a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price on the page; instead, it resets to "tomorrow he would return again," which reads as stasis without the visible forfeiture required for Earned Stasis. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The causality is clean within its own logic, but the climax—"Success"—is summarized, not enacted, weakening closure proof.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is uncertain: the opening suggests Accumulative/Textural (lyric arbor, ritual sorting, monuments), but the middle pivots to Causal plot (prodding the speck triggers a sequence of revelations). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("the keeper of memories") but lacks visible cost—Elias loses nothing and gains infinite purpose. Orientation debt is mild (who/where/when land by ~150 words), so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but the causality of the transformation is entirely external (the speck does all the work). The final paragraph moralizes the theme rather than charging an image, and the "something emerges transformed always" refrain becomes a crutch rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tinkerer's stance shift toward accepting chaos, crystallized when he places the broken parts in the pool and follows the compass), but the cost remains abstract—he decides not to fix clocks anymore without showing what livelihood, identity, or concrete option he forecloses. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building density through recurring images: compass, waterfall, broken clocks) but the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material; the compass "glows faintly, its needle steady now" after spinning wildly, yet this shift isn't causally linked to his choice or to any persistent constraint he navigated. The phrase "that was the only way to truly mend time" summarizes theme rather than landing cost through image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when by the opening line and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration through the coin's kintsugi repair: Elian physically fuses the chip with gold, crystallizing his shift from seeking perfect balance to honoring fracture, with visible cost (he accepts Lyra may not return). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—rain, scales, embers, and the coin recur with shifting weight—and the final image ("golden scar a map of what had been broken and what had been rebuilt") reweights the premise. One micro turn (gold flowing into the chip) deepens the dominant stake. Minor deduction: the closure image states its own meaning ("balance wasn't about symmetry") rather than letting the kintsugi speak purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by the opening lines; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: each spectral encounter adds density toward a thematic charge. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the second soul (child) is healed identically to the first (woman), with no escalation in difficulty, method, or cost. The final paragraph asserts continuation ("the story continued") rather than landing a decisive image or reconfiguration that reweights prior material. Closure reads as conceptual assertion ("healing began with a single, courageous laugh") without visible cost on the page, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (violet forest, phantom mask pressure) builds to a conceptual repricing when Kael reframes mercy as active counter-action rather than negation, and the forest light shifts in response. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he remains "rooted in trauma" but now "growing from it"), legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the trauma memory unlocks the equation, satisfying the lens requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fragment → market → canvases → final portrait) with a Conceptual Repricing attempted at closure: the protagonist realizes she "had always been here" and that "the story was never just about her." However, the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, no live option closed. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first third. The escalation consists of accumulating discovery beats rather than narrowing tactical options, and the ending dissolves the market into "ordinary glass" without dramatizing what the translator sacrifices or gains in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (dust patterns → ghost vision → object retrieval → release). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief replaces oppression; the ghost dissipates), and the cost is legible in the final image ("cold, dense weight" and "solved riddle" cracks). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision reveals the hidden object, narrowing his search and reweighting the room's decay as wound rather than mere neglect.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual-repricing closure. The story teaches a pattern of whispers, frost messages, and the bottled fragment building toward the press-lever rupture. Orientation anchors (Elias, glass orchard library, cloud-sea) arrive early. The closure—library dissolves into fractals, then reforms with smooth glass and lifted weight—delivers a conceptual repricing, but the cost reads more asserted ("weight of forever lifted") than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that alters his final leap. The leap itself promises rather than pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Kaelen on asteroid museum after Chronal Refraction. The closure—smuggling the shard to preserve private memory over institutional narrative—lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (foregoing official recognition, keeping truth small). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the night ritual with veiled mirrors and drifting light builds density toward the hand-with-flower vision that reweights the dispute from academic to human. One meaningful deepening occurs when visible time congeals around the shard to reveal intimate use. The cost is conceptual and relational but legible on the page in the final renunciation of the board.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the repair proceeds as foretold without reversal or deepening. Closure registers as a successful technical task ("The nightingale's song returned") without visible cost or a decision that reweights prior material. The ending summarizes triumph rather than landing a decisive image that charges the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (petrichor lab, post-mill shutdown, compass discovery) and follows a clean causal chain: compass → psychometry reading → limestone cliffs → descent → lagoon discovery → renunciation. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; escalation tightens through psychometric vision, physical descent, and the lagoon revelation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elias leaves the compass and exits transformed, foreclosing his collector identity with visible cost. The cost is legible in "a finder no longer" and the shift from hoarding traces to accepting mystery. One slight softness: the explorers' fate is recounted via vision rather than dramatized encounter, which mutes the climactic pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (sculptor, archway, storm) and a loose causal thread (slide reveals sculptures → she visits each → completion), but the closure is declarative summary rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The storm "calming as if in response" offers convenience rather than earned consequence. The dominant lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending relies on explanation ("a testament to the alliances") instead of an image that reweights prior material. Cost remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    The piece assembles a mosaic structure (winter → spring → summer → autumn → winter) but never teaches the reader how these seasonal shards cohere under a single lens; each is summarized rather than dramatized, creating an and-then sequence without because/therefore linkage. Orientation is scattered: we move from studio to postcards to pavilion to chapel without anchoring transitions or spatial coherence within ~120 words of each shift. The "closure" is conceptual discovery (flowers bloom for nocturnal pollinators) but this insight is delivered as exposition in paragraph 18 rather than earned through on-page action or choice that forecloses a path. No visible cost or trade-off charges the final image; Lena's transformation from obsession to contentment is asserted, not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: beach-debris messages accumulate meaning, the lagoon reveals itself as memory-vault, and the final "REMEMBER" reweights the opening "PARLEY." Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the lagoon shifts from mystery to living ledger—with felt cost (diary's cipher broken, Elias bound as translator). Orientation anchors promptly (floating library, Elias, lagoon, dusk). However, the retrocognitive flooding and shape's appearance feel convenient rather than causally motivated by prior choices; the diary "clicks" without clear mechanical groundwork, weakening the because/therefore linkage even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story attempts accumulation through the creation of town elements, but causality is weak—Elian's hesitation dims the lanterns, then his "choice" brightens them without intermediary friction or cost. The closure unit (town complete, Elian integrated) lacks on-page cost; the bottle simply "grows cool" and the citizens appear fully formed. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words) but functional. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration in theory, but the cost is asserted ("weight of the amber bottle now forgotten") rather than shown, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (transformation from keeper to vessel). Orientation anchors arrive late—"Needle Spire, fifty-seven floors above the sleeping city" establishes location only after abstract tracing patterns. The closure lands with conceptual cost (dissolution of self into archive), but the causal chain from finding wax to absorption feels compressed; the middle-grade field trip memory functions as convenient unlock rather than earned causality. The "accidental prophecy" unfurls through pure emotional transfer without dramatized resistance or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is established (icebound atrium, post-egg-hatching), but causality is unclear: the egg hatching released "vortex inheritance" three cycles ago, yet the story never dramatizes how this inheritance constrains present options or why *now* is the moment to reopen the chamber. The closure—syncing borrowed time with the great-grandmother and recalibrating the inheritance—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual and told ("frantic energy was gone") rather than felt through a decisive trade-off or forfeiture. The middle builds texture but not because/therefore linkage; the protagonist performs gestures and whispers a language, then steps through without a meaningful tightening that narrows live options. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural attempting Causal closure, but the recalibration is asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The sequence—sensor check → glue drying → test activation → bell pull → data logging—traces a logical arc, but no meaningful reversal tightens options. The "switch" from electronic to bell is procedural, not a forced choice with visible cost. Closure reads as satisfied completion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final paragraph offers thematic summary ("favoring listening over noise") instead of an on-page cost that forecloses a path. The storm's arrival is prospective, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "the hush of an overlooked era" never anchors to a legible timeframe. The story attempts Accumulative/Textural design but the closure unit ("yellow lantern glass remained as a silent testament") offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The final paragraph summarizes transformation off-page ("Elara's essence continued to flow") rather than landing a legible closure moment. The decades-long summary structure dissolves pressure rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors adequately by ~120 words (post-fire world, apiary, visible ghosts, stained glass box). The piece follows a single-POV, two-beat structure: discord in the covenant observed via the box's color shift, then the ritual that reknits unity. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—three new ghosts arrive, drawn by equilibrium rather than conflict, crystallizing the oasis's role as refuge—but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. I cannot point to a precise sentence where Elisha's renunciation, forfeiture, or altered tactic becomes visible; instead, the resolution rests on the ghosts' acceptance and the system's resilience, which reads more like a return to baseline than a transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when clarify only after the urn fragment appears (~25% in). The drive lens reads hybrid—causal discovery moves paired with accumulative mood—but the garage-sale code mechanism arrives as exposition rather than dramatized constraint, breaking because/therefore linkage. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (comfort replaces fear) but the cost is declared, not felt on the page: no specific action is forfeited, no live option closed. Applied Orientation Test penalty −0.4; also cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly early. The piece offers a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt—the poet creates a sculpture, observes it, then walks away as the tide claims it—but the cost remains abstract and told rather than shown in a decisive image. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final third recycles prior reflection ("beauty lived in the margins," "woven dawns") without a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake. The ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure effect, and the conceptual price is asserted, not made undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early enough (caretaker, temple orchard, post-diagnosis). Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Kaelen's death and the diary's final entry reweight the project's meaning—but the cost is more told than shown: "no fear," "last of his strength," pages "fluttering." The copper-wire transformation unfolds through summary ("three months into his sentence, the entire orchard had been transformed") rather than dramatized beats, so the tightening effect is muted. A resonant reconfiguration is legible, yet the passage from diagnosis to death compresses all conflict into reflective exposition, weakening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to a conceptual repricing at the pedestal), and the final shimmer/absorption moment reweights the pilgrimage concept. Orientation anchors appear early enough (tower, Aris, post-contact setting). However, the closure cost is atmospheric rather than legible: the amber vanishes and Aris "feels" belief, but no prior live option is foreclosed on the page. The "because/therefore" chain from ascent to placement to transformation reads more as inevitability than earned causality, and the final paragraph's thematic summary ("alignment of elements") replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric resonance through seed imagery and ceremonial cadence), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the coachman arrives, scatters seeds, and departs without on-page escalation. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (luminescent roots = charged image), yet the cost remains asserted ("submerged concord...a resurrection") rather than felt or conceptual with visible price. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The single-scene ritual lacks the pressure accumulation required for high-band entry under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The piece follows a causal chain: cylinder → heat method → leaf reveals coordinates → next destination. However, closure is weak—the story ends on a plan ("Tomorrow, he would stand...") rather than a decisive change or reconfigured stance with felt cost. The final paragraph asserts promise and connection without demonstrating what has been paid or lost. No meaningful tightening occurs; each clue simply leads to the next without narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulation—shimmer noticed, ghost sky overlaid, insight struck, maps drawn—tightens through density increase and cadence shift, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias's exile crystallizes into purpose with the final image of the growing wall map. The cost is felt: his family is lost, his isolation persists, yet the "echoing silence" becomes "alive with potential," a renunciation of ease in favor of exploration. No causality breaks; closure lands under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear heist structure and delivers an on-page closure when the Architect concedes and the sky resets, but the causal chain is soft: Kaelen's arrival triggers dialogue, not escalating obstacles. The chess exchange functions as ritual rather than escalating pressure—each piece swaps cleanly without narrowing options or raising cost. The Architect's realization ("guarding his workshop from himself") arrives via declaration rather than dramatized discovery, weakening the closure's felt cost under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with a walk-through reflection structure. Orientation anchors (National Archives rotunda, interregnum timeframe, Elara alone) arrive early. However, no meaningful pressure tightens: Elara enters with her documentary mission already formed and leaves having traced three words in dust without any dramatized cost or foreclosed path. The chessboard's missing pawns function as static metaphor rather than a pressure point that alters her stance. The ending recapitulates theme ("luminous absence") but offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost—she will continue this work, unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who she is, where "home" was, and why remembering became painful remain unanchored past 120 words and through to closure (−0.5). The piece chains discovery beats (mirror → stone → feather → power activation → practice → stable reality) in "and-then" fashion without causal pressure narrowing options. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; each night she experiments and grows stronger in a frictionless upward arc. The ending gesture ("she might not need to return") offers no on-page decisive change, no felt cost, and no clear before/after—it's a vague possibility rather than closure with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: tutor seeks atonement → decodes tapestry → navigates labyrinth → resolves stalemate → achieves forgiveness. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (years of guilt winnowed away), and the platinum pawn move crystallizes his redemption. One meaningful tightening occurs when he enters the labyrinth and faces the final board, though the ease of his ultimate insight slightly undercuts the earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: POV, setting, and goal emerge piecemeal across the first 150+ words, though the cumulative effect eventually coheres. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—poetry sessions deepen understanding across beats—yet the closure pivots to a causal act (crumbling the spire) that contradicts the established method of gradual refraction. The ending asserts transformation ("spire begin to crumble") without showing the mechanism or cost on the page; the reader is told consequences approach but does not witness a legible closure unit with felt price. Cause/effect linkage between "most ambitious effort yet" and structural failure is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives clearly: alchemist, floating workshop, acid sea, statue restoration task. The dominant stake—completing the narration/restoration—coheres throughout. However, the wave submersion arrives and resolves with no causal ripple: he continues narrating "through memory alone" underwater, the workshop rights itself, and he simply resumes. This micro-reversal carries no visible cost or tactical adjustment, weakening the escalation link. The ending offers a conceptual repricing (oblivion transformed into beauty) but the cost is asserted rather than felt—what option did he foreclose, what stamina or resource was spent? The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of matching pockmarks to memories), yet the final image doesn't sharpen prior density so much as declare thematic satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early (painter, quay), but "after the mirror cracks" as timeframe remains vague until retrospective explanation. The wrong turn into the cave network provides a clear spatial transition, and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the shell's release and the painter's acceptance, with the final image of the cracked mirror reframed as "possibilities." Cost is gestured at ("the weight of that promise lift slightly") but remains diffuse; the specific price paid—what path is foreclosed, what is lost—never lands in a concrete image or action. The "temporary eternity" motif recurs but functions as thematic echo rather than causal constraint. Escalation is more textural deepening than causal tightening, consistent with the inferred lens, but the closure reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ascent and scent-creation accumulate toward the cork's release, which reconfigures the premise with a quiet, lyric closure. Orientation anchors (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, post-heat-wave dawn) land clearly within the first third. However, the closure unit—the cork lifting and vanishing—lacks legible cost on the page; we see the object depart but not what Elias has forfeited or what consequence he now faces. The "proof was in the leaving" declares rather than dramatizes the cost, preventing the Resonant Reconfiguration from landing with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the map-building ritual accumulates meaning through repeated handling of the censer foot and patches, culminating in a tonal shift ("the navigation was the solace"). However, the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration reading as Earned Stasis—lacks a felt cost on the page; the final walk "through" grief is asserted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses options. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost proof test reveals no exact sentence where a trade-off or price materializes at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure: Decisive Change (Elara presses the glass eye, achieving partial occlusion) + micro-RR (recognition between two sufferers, potential sharing). Orientation anchors by line 3 (hanging orchard, post-virus world, Elara foraging). The because/therefore chain holds: Elara acquires relic → storm forces decision → stranger's arrival raises stakes → activation grants occlusion → mutual relief and implied solidarity. Cost is visible (three seasons' truffles, the risk of exposure during use). One meaningful tightening when the stranger arrives and Elara's thoughts betray her. The truffle becomes "forgotten," which weakens the foraging frame slightly, but closure participation (shared vulnerability, relic as potential gift) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern early (borrowed memories, collected objects) and the Edelweiss returns at closure to reweight the stake. However, the closure unit is thin: Hemlock's nightly flower placement is a gesture without felt cost or consequence that forecloses a live option. The woman's story is summarized rather than discovered through dramatized gaps, weakening causal pressure. Orientation anchors appear promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the ending reads as thematic echo rather than reconfiguration with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is established early (map dealer, shop, creek). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery of the chip → following ants → cavern → doorway → map with his name → realization → return. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the chip and doorway reweight his passivity, and the final line ("picked up his pen") signals a shift from tracing others' stories to drawing his own. The cost is implied rather than visceral—no on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path is dramatized, only the "quiet acknowledgment" and his smile. The cavern sequence feels compressed and summarized ("the symbols glimmered, one by one") rather than pressure-built beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative layering (dream → climb → grotto → memory recovery), but the key reversal—her realization of celestial origin—is triggered by passive recognition rather than protagonist action. The Orientation Test passes narrowly (queen, castle, storm season anchored by ~100 words), but the closure unit relies on exposition: "she was not dreaming of this place but remembering it" tells rather than dramatizes the shift. Cost is declared ("the kingdom she could no longer call home") but not legible in concrete forfeiture or visible consequence on the page; the smile and "lacy menace" replace scene pressure with summary assertion. One meaningful tightening occurs (climb → grotto → revelation), meeting minimum scope, but the final image does not reconfigure prior material with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with orientation debt: we don't learn who Elara is, where precisely the ember nexus sits, or what the pocket-sun actually does until well past the 120-word mark. The closure hinges on "capturing the density of presence" and "returning differently," but these operations remain metaphorical—no concrete before/after options are legible. Kael's secret, the inciting incident, is withheld entirely, preventing the reader from tracing causal pressure. The ending asserts transformation ("as it was meant to be remembered") without showing what changed or what was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—Elias's shift from passive documentation to the realization that "beginning again remains the most beautiful rebellion." The cost is conceptual: acceptance of predetermined mortality as liberation rather than trap. Orientation is clear (mountain cabin, post-gravestone discovery). However, the escalation is primarily reflective density increase without on-page micro-choices that narrow options; the final "smile" and perspective shift feel asserted rather than causally compelled by prior scene pressure. The temporal scrambling teaches a pattern but doesn't pay off in altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and the screw discovery offers a clear tightening. However, the closure—Elara feeling hope and her hands steadying—relies on the scent return as a convenience reset rather than a decisive change with on-page cost. The inscription *L. 1923* provides new knowledge but doesn't narrow Elara's options or extract a visible price; she simply feels better. The causal lens holds through the screw examination but the ending Image recharges prior motifs without demonstrating what Elara has given up or altered in her world.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Aeris completes the ritual, the crystal softens into a permanent scar-story, and he achieves solace without erasure—visible cost is the irreversible marking of his hand. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail (tea ritual, storm gathering, crystallization sequence) and culminates in the act of writing that fuses memory with flesh. One meaningful deepening occurs when the quill tip becomes part of his hand, merging tool and self. The "held breath" timeframe and storm cycle provide clear temporal anchors, and the platform remains spatially coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story opens with clear orientation (who, where, dominant stake) and follows a causal arc: Eloise retrieves the bottle → applies the oscillator → achieves contact → delivers apology → resolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the apology delivered, bond mended), but the cost is abstract ("peace") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option. The orchard demolition frame is set up but never returns to pressure the climax. Lens: Causal with accumulative touches; holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: who this witness is, where exactly he stands, and when this occurs stay abstract. The piece moves through a series of philosophical tableaux without causal linkage—dictionary opens, library shifts, words float—connected by "and then" rather than "because." Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("a single word emerged") but the cost is purely asserted, not dramatized on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density increase reweights a legible stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—observations accrete toward a conceptual repricing where Elias reframes clocks as creators of measurement rather than passive recorders. Orientation is prompt (shepherd, station, fjord, post-whistle). The counting-backwards investigation offers a micro-reversal when he notices the stutter at seventy-three, but this moment doesn't narrow his options or alter his next moves; the logbook review that follows is reflective summary, not pressure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final smile and realization reweight his life's work, though the cost—thirty-seven years of misunderstanding—is implied rather than felt on the page as a present forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece tracks Causal logic (Elara collects scrawls → presents notebook → father's perspective softens), and the final "fractures in his certainty" gesture at Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains vague: no on-page choice is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no felt price paid. The heart-attack timeframe anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, and the train-to-library structure is clean, but the closure beat ("You've widened my perspective") tells the change rather than showing a renunciation, endurance, or decision with legible weight. The lens holds but the ending lacks the decisive pressure or conceptual repricing required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflective exposition about ritual, history, and the loop without causal because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—Archie's realization that estrangement requires "connection at the right distance"—but the repricing is told rather than enacted, and no visible cost accompanies it. The orientation anchor (who, where) arrives cleanly, but the story never dramatizes a single nightly call; all action is summarized, leaving the closure unit abstract and the conceptual cost inferred rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening paragraph. The piece reads as accumulative/textural: Elias moves from jetty to conservatory to jetty, steeping himself in memory and documenting proximate causes, culminating in the locket offering. The closure unit—placing the locket on the bloom as the jetty recedes—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: acceptance after decades of preservation work). Cost is signaled (he removes the locket, the jetty recedes, "his work was done") but remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page; the final image reweights prior material but the emotional or relational price is muted by summary phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (disused railway platform, Orion, logistician fleeing thanks). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ivy imagery, sound motifs, and the moon-rock exchange build to a conceptual repricing where "sterile, empty space" is traded for "resonant world of sound." Closure lands on-page with cost (he relinquishes the moon fragment and his external quest framework), and the final image reweights loneliness from resident to visitor. The rumor-chain setup and cupola sequence cohere under this lens. Deduction: the middle sag (woman's exposition, ladder climb) loses some causal density and the woman's "swap the waypoints" logic feels slightly opaque, risking a −0.3 for motivational clarity in the hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the three-note sequence deepens immersion and the final stillpoint image reconfigures the opening quest from external cartography to internal recognition. Orientation anchors quickly (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, platinum ring) and the closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost, however, is asserted ("consumed his fear, his grief, his longing") rather than shown through a tactical forfeiture or body-level price; the final walk back feels like soft reset. One meaningful deepening is present, but the conceptual cost remains oblique and the "he finally saw" line tilts toward thematic summary rather than charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored (interpreter at desk, anomaly outside) though the window/cityscape/anomaly relationship remains spatially vague. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accretes linked images (pen, anomaly, seeds, garden) toward a final stance. The closure is Earned Stasis: the interpreter explicitly chooses to maintain the anomaly and "garden of doubt" after testing erasure, forecloses the path of correction, and accepts imperfection as method. Cost is visible ("the weight of the loss," the anomaly remains warped). However, the middle beats loop: "unbend the nib" → write → erase → rewrite cycles without meaningful escalation; the second attempt ("seeds were planted in the wrong soil") produces only cosmetic difference (anomaly "lessens just enough"). The final paragraphs rehash the premise rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Julian and Lyra are, what they're actually doing, and why remains opaque past 120 words; the Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) applies. The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural (recurring harbor imagery, sign-language motifs, camera clicks) but delivers no decisive deepening or cadence shift; the final "their work done" and "the world remembered" are told assertions without on-page cost or reweighting. No reversal, narrowing of options, or meaningful tightening occurs; the story circles the same lyric mood from opening to close. Closure form is missing; the ending announces completion without dramatizing change or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Elara, mountains, cartographer's shed) but causality is weakly motivated: she "finds" each fragment conveniently, paints it, then finds the next in a loop that reads as checklist rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure—burning the scroll to "free the promise"—lacks visible cost; she achieves peace without forfeiting a live option or facing genuine consequence. The inferred lens (Causal) demands tighter linkage; the piece delivers episodic accumulation without escalation that narrows her choices or changes her knowledge in a way that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "sound wave garden" is named but not spatially anchored, and "experimenters" are referenced without on-page presence or opposition. The drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation is attempted, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Kael's drumming produces the desired effect without complication. Closure reads as a summary declaration ("the shared dream alive") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The experimenters' threat evaporates off-page, removing the only potential friction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure lands on-page—Kael proves his theory and opens the chamber—but the cost is unclear: he wins the bet yet immediately gives away the prize without dramatized sacrifice or foreclosed option. Causality holds through the whisper test and key insertion, though the geomagnetic storm and zodiac coin's glowing function feel ornamental rather than pressure-driving. The lens reads Causal with a situational accent (storm as complication), but the storm never tightens tactics or alters Kael's plan. One meaningful tightening occurs (the whisper test), meeting minimum scope, yet the final image ("secrets yet to unfold") tilts toward sequel setup rather than resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian arranges shutters across two weeks, Anna approaches, the pattern resolves to encode her father's understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Anna perceives encoded meanings, gains understanding), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—she cries and lingers, yet no present option is foreclosed and no future path visibly narrows. The dental mirror's verification role and the shutter mechanics are told in summary rather than dramatized as choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who Arthur is and what he's attempting solidifies only after the first several paragraphs of atmospheric description. The closure—window displays activating and Arthur hearing "unspoken words rippling"—registers as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract and felt rather than concretely legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with density building through motifs (grotto, chess, silence), but the final image reweights prior material more through assertion ("the future was learning how to begin") than through a decisive on-page change in options or knowledge. Apply Orientation Test penalty: −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and the dock setting clarify by ~100 words, but the "violence became impossible" premise and its causal weight remain vague throughout. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (water, scrimshaw, whale call layering toward transformation), yet closure lacks visible cost—she returns "different" but the dock life and her work continue unchanged, and no path is foreclosed on the page. The scrimshaw "unlocks" her heart, but what she loses or refuses is asserted, not dramatized. Whale's call and island function as symbolic prompts rather than plot levers that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when adequately within the opening paragraph. The story establishes accumulative pressure through Elara's rituals (whittling, flower preservation, performances for inspectors) and the knock at the door provides a minor turn, but the resolution—placing the finished hummingbird among the flowers and narrating to the bouquet—functions as Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change. The cost is implied (risk of discovery, ongoing suppression) but not made undeniable in the final image; Elara's situation after the inspector leaves appears unchanged. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (ritual density, pattern of defiance), held adequately, but the closure reconfiguration lacks the sharpness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece offers a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (frozen lake, colonnade, atrium), satisfying the orientation test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ban lifts, Kael approaches, dissolves, reforms, and walks deeper; pressure accretes through imagery and metaphor rather than because/therefore turns. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Kael's "shadow stretching long" and his elevation to "master" of ambiguity feel like pure gain, not a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence at the ending legibly forecloses a path or charges the final image with price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (the plant arrangements build toward the barter, which enables the awakening). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening (courtyard, Leo, post-phoenix world), and the closure lands on the page with a decisive change (Leo perceives color for the first time). The cost is implied—he must tend Lyra's gardens for a season—but the final image prioritizes sensory revelation over the foreclosed path, leaving the price felt but not foregrounded in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the bell ringer's realization that "the artificial pilgrimage had revealed itself as a journey inward," but this shift is told rather than shown through a causal turn that narrows options. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image—light and sound merging—does not reweight prior material with legible cost; it simply restates the premise. No visible forfeiture or constraint shapes the ending, so the closure reads as thematic declaration rather than a felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates in summary-dominant mode, recounting Elian's transformation and teaching practice rather than dramatizing a single scene with causal pressure. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague until well past 120 words; the observatory exists "outside of normal chronology," but this metaphysical framing never constrains a concrete choice. No clear closure unit: the ending offers thematic meditation on legacy without a decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized poise that reconfigures options with felt cost. The piece reads as backstory for a larger work rather than a complete narrative arc with on-page stakes and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one clear tightening: Elara's decision to confide her discovery to Chen. However, the closure reads as thesis delivery rather than a decisive change with felt cost—she simply states she will "continue the work" after Chen leaves, which reaffirms her prior stance without foreclosing a live option. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (measuring tape and cards accumulate meaning), but the ending doesn't reweight prior material through a crystallized image; it restates intent. Cost remains abstract ("some patterns are too important not to map") rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or bodily consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure unit—walking away carrying memories—lands on the page but the cost remains abstract: no visible trade-off, forfeited path, or tactical constraint emerges from her success. Causality operates in summary mode: "Days blurred into nights" compresses the entire purification without showing a single reversal or tightening choice. The piece reads as Causal by intent but delivers only accumulative description; the inferred lens cannot stabilize. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, preventing deeper penalty, but the ending reconfigures nothing with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and her concrete role remain vague past the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the metamorphosis and its cost are summarized ("By dawn, the transformation was complete") rather than shown in a decisive on-page moment. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of unbound shadows accumulating toward a solution), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it asserts success without showing friction or failure. Causal linkage between the river stone's use and the library's reconfiguration is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers reflective beats and symbolic objects to build toward thematic resonance. Orientation anchors (Maria, workshop, post-betrayal) arrive early. However, closure relies on conceptual repricing ("blend of truth and hope") articulated through naming rather than a visible action or renunciation with felt cost on the page. The two-week passage and Eleanor's arrival provide structure, but the final image's cost is asserted in Maria's smile and metaphor rather than demonstrated through a choice that narrows options or a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (Maya, tower, dawn, post-procedure) land within the first 120 words. The lens reads Causal-hybrid: plant telepathy triggers realization, which drives the apology visit and the decision to change practice. However, the closure cost is stated rather than dramatized—"I should have helped you understand them" and the decision to "begin teaching" lack on-page friction or sacrifice. The frosted hourglass recurs but remains static; Samuel's touch at his faded scars provides a micro-turn, yet the cost of Maya's prior erasures is told in retrospect rather than felt in present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by the second paragraph and holds it through closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gazer's shift from burden to peace), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off makes the "before/after" felt with pressure. The final realization that unused love is "archived in moments of non-existence" reweights the premise, but the protagonist's own reservoir simply dissolves into acceptance without a dramatized friction or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece establishes a mystical ritual frame but offers no legible causality: tracing meteors with the astrolabe somehow "frees creativity," yet the mechanism and stakes remain abstract. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is, why tonight matters, and what specific cost she faces emerge slowly through ornamental description. The ending claims rest and transformed creativity, but no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the protagonist collapses, promises "soon," and walks away without visible cost or altered options. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density produces closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (freight guard, glowing dune, post-forest world) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the guard discovers archive access, practices nightly, extracts a seedling, plants it—a tightening from exploration to concrete restoration with the chess clock ticking backward as visible cost. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the seedling takes root, reweighting hope from archived to actual) with conceptual cost legible in the collective effort required. One causal seam: the guard's dreamlessness is declared ideal for navigation but the mechanism—how emptiness prevents losing oneself to alternate histories—remains asserted rather than demonstrated through a near-miss or contrasting example.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "after the sixth sense awakens" remains vague temporally. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Elian moves through tree varieties and the hum intensifies, culminating in a translocation that expands consciousness. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the gear changes, consciousness expands), but cost is asserted in abstract language ("now and forever attuned") rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page. The causal chain is present but soft; the midpoint convergence setup pays off, yet the transformation lacks felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no concrete anchor for who, where, or when; the piece never specifies whether this is literal death, metaphorical transition, or dream state. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught early enough to guide comprehension. No on-page closure: the traveler "withdrew light" and "stepped forward with newly awakened courage" but no before/after is legible, no option foreclosed, no felt cost paid. The ending asserts transformation without dramatizing the price or showing what was renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (bellhop, cobalt fortress, assigned months ago). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust imagery, silence motif, the ledger as pattern-break. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("his silence now a weapon"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed—no on-page renunciation of escape or prior hope that we saw him hold. The bolt-as-key mechanism and ledger discovery provide one meaningful deepening, satisfying minimal escalation for this length, but the final image ("cold, quiet fire," "cobalt walls seemed lighter") leans on metaphor rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated mentions of drift, ink, and library decay toward a final symbolic image. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's abstract framing. The closure unit (the pretender's collapse via the spoken rune and ink droplet) occurs on the page, but the cost to Kael himself is asserted ("his long duty done") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or emotional reckoning. The piece teaches its lens by mid-story and the final image reweights prior material, satisfying the Accumulative standard, but orientation debt and conceptual-only cost prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: data, atlas page, and tapping rhythms converge to reweight Elias's understanding of impermanence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—paths as meandering rather than lost—but the cost remains oblique; no specific option is foreclosed, and the final walk suggests possibility rather than sacrifice. The revelation that "paths were never meant to last" reframes the premise, yet the piece does not dramatize what Elias gives up or what tactical constraint this insight imposes. One meaningful deepening occurs when the console numbers mirror the coastline, but the ending drifts toward thematic summary rather than a charged image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates imagery (dust motes, stone circle, opera glasses) toward a final cadence shift where the protagonist "reignites" purpose. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she stands ready with renewed stance—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (barefoot stargazer, abandoned repair bay, margin of daylight) appear early and remain stable. The hum's intensification provides one meaningful deepening, but the stone circle's mechanics arrive late and function more as atmosphere than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who Maeva is and what the Reconstruction means remain vague past the opening third. The closure—unsealing the amber—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual and diffuse ("traditions beginning to evolve") rather than a legible personal or relational forfeit. The drive lens reads as causal with stated stakes, yet key beats (discovering the kite, decoding the script) are summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain. One meaningful tightening is present (the decision to unseal), but it lacks visible friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Maya, cliffside arboretum, post-trauma timeline). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through repeated imagery (freeze, photograph, plants as metaphor) and a cadence shift at the sea-thrift moment. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—framing the photograph and placing succulents beside it forecloses hiding and crystallizes integration with visible cost (end of concealment). The cost is legible on the page in the act of moving the photograph from hiding to display. One meaningful deepening (the transcendent freeze) tightens her relationship to trauma, meeting the scope requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mending of the box and cards serving as the central action, but the closure effect—picking up the brush to paint again—lacks a visible or felt cost that would constitute Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The artist's resolve "hardened" and he becomes "something remade," yet no prior option is foreclosed and no trade-off dramatized; the ending reads as declaration rather than reweighting of prior material with pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift is required, but the final paragraph simply extends the affirming rhetoric without a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established early (encampment, post-eclipse, Kael's tracker role). The piece tracks an accumulative lens—Kael follows the drone, finds ink, observes patterns—but no meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost. The "revelation" is delivered as summary insight rather than on-page action that forecloses a path; Kael's final understanding leaves him "lighter" and at "peace," a softening rather than a reconfiguration with cost. The ending image ("disappeared into the shadows, not as an act of hiding, but as one of belonging") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual assertion, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first lines, satisfying the test. The piece follows a single POV and one continuous sequence, but causality remains thin: Elara's choice to upload the letter is presented as fait accompli rather than a decision forged under pressure, and the "fallout" is told rather than shown. The closure unit—Elara vanishing into the storm with her "purpose" found—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("the weight of it felt like wings") rather than made undeniable through concrete loss or foreclosed options. The lens wobbles between Causal (her action triggers societal change) and Accumulative (repeated images of snow, silence, echoes), never cohering at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed; we receive setting and character labels but no spatial anchor or immediate situational pressure until well past the opening. The piece operates in exposition mode throughout, summarizing Elara's habits and beliefs rather than dramatizing a tightening choice. No on-page reversal or meaningful pressure change occurs; the merchants' arrival tomorrow is setup, not closure. Closure form is absent: the ending restates theme without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the piece functions under an Accumulative/Textural lens where ritual intensification and cosmic response create a tightening toward the goddess's echo. The closure—capturing the echo in the rail spike and rebalancing the sky—lands on the page with felt cost (the echo "now a part of his own quiet world" and "both a treasure and a sorrow"), satisfying RR/Charged Poise criteria. One meaningful deepening (the garden's hum falters, stars slow, the tremor arrives) is sufficient at this length, though the cost remains more asserted than viscerally demonstrated in a final choice or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: phone call → investigation → discovery of hidden passage diagram → resolution to expose the truth. Orientation anchors arrive early (observatory, after the call, heiress investigating). However, the closure lacks on-page cost: Elara's decision to "print it" is declared but not tested, and no visible price or tactical shift appears in the final beat. The escalation from suspicion to proof occurs mostly through reflection rather than scene pressure, and the final image ("print it") resolves intent without dramatizing consequence or foreclosing a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who and where early (constellation tattooist, laboratory) and establishes a single stake (releasing trapped sounds/guilt). However, the closure—Orion writing a letter and whispering to the amber—lacks decisive change or visible cost; the "different kind of silence" is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending gesture (letter-writing, dreaming) recounts resolution rather than enacting it. The causal chain (amber resonates → device translates → Orion prepares tattoo) is present but the final image of peace and steady hands tells us the change rather than showing the cost or foreclosed path required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who (Elara, chalk artist), where (whispering grotto), and when (during the unlearning) within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. A meaningful tightening occurs when Elara positions the tile flake at the mandala's center and the emergent hush responds, shifting from passive observation to active participation. However, the closure—Elara "understanding" and discovering meaning—lands as conceptual insight without visible, felt, or social cost on the page; the final smile and claim that "the unlearning had never been about forgetting" reweights the premise abstractly but the price (what she forfeited, what option closed) remains unclear. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increase through mandala work is present but the Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara paid to achieve this reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: tessera placement, renaming gestures, and the final whisper build density toward a closure image of restoration. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara's endurance and ritual work reconfigure the plaza from graveyard to "garden waiting for its first bloom"—but the cost remains largely asserted rather than concretely felt on the page. The phrase "The world listened" implies reweighting, yet no prior choice was visibly foreclosed or traded off to make that shift legible as a before/after with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece attempts a causal lens: Arthur discovers the coin, uses it to broadcast echoes, and the theater's fate shifts. However, the reversal—restoration plans appearing—occurs off-page and is attributed to distant characters' unexplained responses rather than Arthur's on-page agency. The cost of Arthur's final act (placing the coin on the threshold) is conceptual but not felt; we see no foreclosed path or price paid. The closure reads as a summary of potential rather than a decisive change with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves through the studio, layering colored light in response to phantom emotions until the chaos "organizes." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the noise doesn't vanish but becomes legible architecture), but cost is asserted rather than shown—no specific choice, tool, or relationship is sacrificed to achieve this order. The orientation is prompt (who, where, what by the opening), and the single-scene continuous structure fits the length, but the ending reconfigures meaning through summary ("she had devised a language") rather than a charged image or action that makes the price undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (coastal caves, sensory map maker, post-hibernation world) and establishes a clear Accumulative lens: sensory impressions layer toward mystical discovery. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara redefines her purpose and the caves' silence as latent meaning—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no tactical shift, no visible price paid or path foreclosed on the page. The final paragraph ("The world was waking up, and she was ready to tell its story") declares transformation without showing what she sacrificed or what options narrowed, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving orientation penalty), but causality remains thin: buttons unlock the prophecy through accumulation rather than motivated turns, and the hourglass defying gravity at the end introduces a rule change not cued earlier. The closure image ("sand began to rise") gestures toward transformation but the cost is conceptual only—no tactical path was foreclosed, no relationship altered, no visible price paid for this outcome. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the sorting sequence, but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the prophecy simply "unravels" as promised.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered backstory, the pillbox discovery, coordinate revelation, message creation, and final resignation. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The closure effect reads as Earned Stasis (walking away, vouchsafing Althea's future) with conceptual cost (his own erasure, the ephemeral message). However, the escalation is primarily reflective; the on-page action (finding box, reading note, stamping snow, leaving) functions as illustrative staging for interior monologue rather than because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Cost is asserted ("guarantee her a future, a sanctuary carved from his own ruin") but the price—what he loses by walking away—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (passengers mentioned but never grounded spatially; the inn's gutters appear without establishing the inn). The closure unit—handing over the needle and feeling weight lift—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("weight of his vigil lift") rather than shown through forfeited option or changed stance. The figure's identity (brother's eyes in theirs) is mystical convenience that resolves without causal setup. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, needle, promise layered), but the final beat doesn't reweight prior material through image; it summarizes emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story establishes orientation by ~120 words (Kael, oasis, anomaly investigation). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kael's realization that the oasis cherishes one perfect moment reweights his initial question, and his gesture of presence resolves the thrum with visible effect (fractures vanish, bee disappears). The cost is oblique—opportunity cost of not repairing—but the final image of settled truth and quiet air demonstrates conceptual closure. One concern: the resolution hinges on his phototropic nature "flaring" and calming the anomaly, which reads slightly convenient; the mechanics of how his presence resolves temporal fractures remain impressionistic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (fire escape, harbor, apartment building). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: installation → observation → community adoption. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (neighbors placing mirrors), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The final image reweights the gardener's work through diffusion, yet the price of his labor (time, isolation, risk of dismissal) is told rather than felt in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure with cost. The ending declares transformation ("no longer just a survivor, but a guardian of memory") but no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters tactics—Elara's situation at the close is functionally identical to the opening. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake; the piece simply accumulates reflective declarations. Orientation is present early (who, where, when), preventing a heavier penalty, but causality is absent: no because/therefore linkage drives the stated awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding that he is "woven irrevocably into the pattern") but the cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no tactical shift, no relationship or opportunity foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (storm → nest → sculpture → realization), and the pattern holds, but the final image ("no longer feeling separate") asserts transformation without dramatizing what Elias loses or gives up. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The nest-to-sculpture echo provides one meaningful deepening, satisfying minimum escalation for this length, but the ending's conceptual repricing lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks on-page closure with felt cost. Elara's plan succeeds off-page during an ellipsis ("working through the night"), and the final paragraphs summarize outcomes rather than dramatizing a decisive moment. The causal chain is linear and unearned: she identifies the problem, devises a solution, and wins without reversal, complication, or visible sacrifice. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers no reconfiguration or cost—only distant aftermath and abstract hope.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a spatial-mutiny premise but resolves it through a passively discovered "pattern of frequencies" that materializes conveniently once the compass touches the right spot, bypassing protagonist agency. The closure offers a declarative summary of restoration rather than an on-page image with felt cost; the explorer ascends "carrying the knowledge" in pure tell. Causality is weak: the organ music, compass point, and nexus alignment function as magic keys with no prior constraint or earned limitation. The "vital key lost to time" becomes an abstract broadcast rather than a dramatized turn, and the ending paragraphs loop through thematic restatement instead of landing a single charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias gathers fragments (ribbon, mist, memory) that converge into a portrait, building toward a moment of resonance. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Charged Poise—where "the mist seemed to thin, as if the quarry itself were exhaling" and Elias folds the completed portrait, crystallizing the ritual's meaning. However, the cost remains abstract ("another piece of the world's forgotten sorrow given form") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture; the nail insertion and coordinate alignment create because/therefore linkage to the station's response. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias accepts the burden and prepares to leave), but the cost is mostly asserted rather than dramatized—"accepting the burden" and "nervously confidence returned" are told, not shown through a concrete forfeiture or image that makes the price undeniable. Orientation is mostly clear early, though "perpetual twilight" and "atmospheric chaos" remain vague. One meaningful tightening occurs when the containment field weakens, but the final beat summarizes insight rather than landing an image with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (mystery deepens through fragments, scaffold map, musical discovery), but closure arrives as explanatory summary rather than a decisive image or cost. The hitchhiker's vanishing is told ("became not speculation but reality") rather than shown with sensory particulars that anchor disorientation. The final paragraph explains the theme ("pixelated amnesty wasn't about forgiveness") instead of letting the final action reweight prior material. Orientation is delayed: we learn "bridge-song fiddler" and "mountain scenic pullout" but the specifics of where she stands and what tourists see arrive piecemeal across the first third without a clean anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Jasper, trunk, circus train by paragraph two). The piece follows a mosaic/accumulative structure: inheritance arrival → sanctuary construction → startup rise/fall → return and reflection. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Jasper's understanding of cycles, the growing archive) with conceptual cost visible in the Zimbabwean/Weimar juxtaposition. However, escalation is primarily summarized across months rather than dramatized in beats, and the startup collapse ("fell as quickly as it had risen") relies on telling where a single on-page reversal would tighten pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid—the piece attempts causal linkage (telegram → inscriptions → prophecy) but relies heavily on exposition dump in dialogue. Orientation is clear by the opening. Closure reads as Charged Poise (they will decode together, "armed with knowledge and companionship"), but the cost is conceptual and future-facing rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the final image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows Elara paying a price or surrendering a path at closure—only the promise of future burden.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words, avoiding penalties. The piece tracks a single continuous scene with a dominant stake (confronting frozen guilt). However, the closure relies on summary declaration ("he had found himself") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost; the vortex simply "vanished" and the lake became "calm" without visible consequences that alter later options. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending offers theme claims but no legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, cobalt glade, dusk, post-eclipse) arrive within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through sensory density and the maze-clipping ritual, then shifts at the nexus where two figures mirror each other. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the single point of silver light and Elias's "quiet, profound sense of purpose" reweight the covenant without full restoration—felt cost is present. One meaningful deepening occurs (the recognition scene), sufficient for this length. Causality holds; the topiary-clipping key and scar-matching method link coherently. Minor slip: the nexus insight arrives without prior dramatized friction to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous ritual sequence under a Causal lens: Elian performs the binding, experiences the stranger's memories, receives the fruit, and emerges transformed. However, the closure—eating the fruit and feeling "unburdened"—lacks a legible cost; the "stitching" feels granted rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. The ritual mechanics (silver powder, card disintegration) link cleanly, but the stranger remains a narrative device rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through layered reflection and the grille-cloth scrap, then reweights at closure when Leo pockets the scrap and leaves the inventory unfinished. The cost is conceptual (he abandons the paid assignment) but the final image "listen to the silence, and finally understand its song" leans toward RR/Charged Poise without a sharp before/after in tactics or forfeited relationships. The closure reconfigures Leo's stance but the price—walking away mid-job—remains oblique rather than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (magnetic arbor, Dr. Maris, post-Hamid departure). The closure—planting the seed and achieving understanding—is presented as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual ("from sorrow to understanding") without a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. The causal lens is attempted but the breakthrough ("analogical approach yielded breakthroughs") is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the pivotal turn. The ending reconfigures meaning but the felt price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure effect occurs on the page. The story opens with the librarian performing a daily ritual and ends with them completing that same ritual, smiling in satisfaction—a loop without decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing. The piece reads as pure exposition establishing a fantasy premise rather than a narrative with causality: "this world exists, here's how it works" with no before/after state or foreclosed path. The Orientation Test is barely passed (who/where emerge by ~150 words, though "when" remains vague), but the accumulative lens never coheres into pressure or a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story presents a three-week time jump that obscures causal linkage between discovery and transformation. The closure unit—Elias whispering confessions into seashells—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific on-page moment. Orientation is delayed: we don't learn the protagonist's name until the second section, and the mechanics of how the pearl "acquires abandoned hopes" or how seashells transmit them are asserted, not dramatized. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern lacks a decisive intensification or cadence shift at closure; the final paragraph recycles earlier imagery without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (disused station, Elias, his bag, the river) land early. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: graffiti fragments, the bellows, the river's presence layer toward a final reconfiguration when he tosses the bellows and walks south. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation that forecloses the weight of his father's memory), but cost is more conceptual than visceral—the bellows sinks "without a sound," and the map references "blurred in his mind" softens the price. One meaningful deepening occurs (north to south pivot), but the turn from chasing forgiveness to embodying it is told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is, where she begins, and the nature of the two letters remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—"the library exists within"—but this insight lacks on-page cost; she leaves with journal documentation and a promise to return, foreclosing nothing. The causal lens is ambiguous: the watch mechanism and propagation delays suggest causal linkage, but the dreamer's passive observation and the library's self-revealing structure lean accumulative without a decisive tightening or pattern break that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: layered images (coffee stains, plant voices, crystalline violin) build toward the final moonflower with perforations. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Clementine walks away, leaving research and a string—but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what she loses or gains beyond the assertion of "dream she had chosen." The story establishes who/where/when adequately early, and the lens holds, but the closure image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it gestures toward consequence rather than showing it. One meaningful deepening (realizing her name intertwines with the emperor's) narrows options, satisfying minimal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through description and ritual toward a closure image (the emerald placed in the box). However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist succeeds without setback. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her enduring role—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized ("threshold of stillness had been crossed" tells rather than shows a forfeiture or altered state).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is clean early (grotto, caretaker, tree). However, the story's structure is a single continuous ritual without meaningful tightening—she climbs, reflects, descends, and guides a soul—none of which narrows options or changes her situation. The "realization" about contentment at the tree is stated rather than dramatized through a causal turn, and the ending offers no legible cost or foreclosed path; the caretaker simply continues her eternal role. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with felt consequence; the vineyard hush remains static throughout. Closure fails to deliver a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—Lyra leaving the shard and Elian incorporating it into his toolkit—functions as Earned Stasis with a visible reconfiguration: she no longer needs the void-object, he gains an instrument. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the chime sequence and shard's symbolic weight deepen rather than reverse in causal chain. Cost is legible in Lyra's relinquishment and Elian's acceptance of doubt as mantle. One meaningful deepening present; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands in the pond, merged with distorted stars, having grasped the lesson. However, the cost is asserted rather than felt—no path is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The lens is accumulative/textural (pattern observation deepens until the final image reweights meaning), held consistently, but the reconfiguration lacks undeniable pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains a coherent Accumulative lens: density builds through the arrowhead appraisal, crow patterns, and final realization. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—Kael shifts from prisoner to mapper-of-memory—but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized; no tactical option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The final image ("prepared to sing his first note") gestures toward future action without delivering an on-page price that reweights prior confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the first paragraph. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and luminance imagery build toward a final cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael touches "the true essence of magic"—but the felt cost is abstract ("something had changed… in himself") rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture or choice that reweights prior options. The Cost Proof Test cannot point to a specific line where loss or price is legible, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via synesthetic awakening, and cost is gestured toward ("The skeleton key heavy with answer rather than question"), but the decisive change occurs off-page in underwater ritual rather than through protagonist agency that forecloses a live option. The drive lens reads Causal but the because/therefore chain relies on conveniences: the journal appears pre-decoded, the ritual works on schedule, and cosmic timing aligns without friction. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph, waiving that penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs (boat to wreck descent) but the final image's cost is asserted, not dramatically legible—what path did Orion foreclose by succeeding?

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes a textural/accumulative lens early (backwards prophecies, static bursts, lot-casting) but never tightens options or forecloses a path. Elara's task is declared complete in the final third without on-page resistance or cost: she simply "understood her role" and "quietly smiled." The singularity's approach functions as ambient pressure rather than a causal forcing mechanism. No reversal or deepening alters her tactics; the ending offers thematic assertion ("The cycle continued") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene with clear anchors (observatory, dusk, atlas page) and a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper names his fears and leaves them behind, accepting grief as shared rather than buried. The closure lands on the page with visible cost—he walks away lighter but scarred. However, the because/therefore linkage is thin: the recording "led him here" without shown causality, and the crystallization itself feels more like ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a live option. The midpoint lacks a meaningful tightening; the naming proceeds sequentially without resistance or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (sapphire viaduct, Kael, dried riverbed). The causal lens is ambiguous—drip-rate observation doesn't clearly narrow options, and the bell's repair feels more accumulative/lyric than because-therefore linked. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the viaduct hums, "perhaps he had tuned it"), but the felt cost is unclear: Kael walks away renewed rather than foreclosing a path, and "a world slowly, impossibly, healing" tells rather than shows consequence. The "not mended the world, but perhaps tuned it" hedges the closure effect, leaving the reader uncertain whether stakes changed or merely shifted register.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the photograph trail accumulates toward a final resonance. The closure moment (laying the final photo, the town "beginning to resurface") offers Resonant Reconfiguration through image, but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "twilight" contradicts "midnight" in the opening line. The warden's ritual completes without a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options, reducing escalation to atmospheric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: preparation → flame adjustment → transformation, with the crystal's state serving as the throughline. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara "no longer afraid" and embracing transformation), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action is foreclosed, no tactical shift or visible price paid. The final paragraph asserts readiness for transformation without dramatizing what she risks or loses, reducing closure to declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~200 words of lyric description, applying the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The leap offers a physical act but no clear cost or option-foreclosure; the voice calling the seeker's name at the end feels like externally granted resolution rather than earned consequence. The piece accumulates texture but the closure unit (the leap and radio contact) does not reweight prior material with visible cost. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not charge prior motifs with new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~60 words (Kael, floating rock dojo, void); no penalty. The drive lens reads Causal with symbolic overtones: Kael's act of vivifying the brain causes the clone to dissolve. However, the mechanics of "pouring his will" remain opaque—what specific action or cost triggers the synaptic glow is unclear, weakening the because/therefore linkage at closure. The ending delivers a Decisive Change (clone dissolves, Kael claims the brain) with conceptual cost ("alone with the truth"), but the cost feels stated more than felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clone grabs Kael's arm and he must "do more than wake the brain," narrowing his options.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear magical-realist premise: sound can be extracted from walls through ritual. Orientation is adequate (tunnel, after daughter's death, leaf blower as tool) within the first third. The closure—light motes drifting home and sinking into the house—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the household transformed from haunted-by-absence to held-by-presence), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; Elias suffers physical strain but gains exactly what he sought without meaningful sacrifice or surprise. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual builds toward release), but the final image doesn't reweight prior material—it simply completes the announced goal.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the pendant arrival shifts the garden's meaning and the final image reweights "dimensional homesickness" from ache to "warm echo." Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first third without clear spatial anchor by ~120 words (−0.4). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Sylvan waits with newfound grace), but the cost is conceptual and oblique; the story tells us the ache "was no longer a sharp pain" without dramatizing the price paid. The causality is coherent within the lyric mode, but the closure image lacks a felt or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with spatial and temporal orientation (ember nexus at twilight, thirteenth year), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: successive approximations build toward a final reweighted image of the transformed crozier. However, the closure unit—Elias lifting the staff and feeling "hope"—lands as conceptual repricing but the cost remains abstract ("suffocating destiny" unlocked) rather than a specific forfeiture or tradeoff visible on the page. The five approximations provide structural escalation, but the mechanics of transmutation are summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is anchored early (tower city, gorge, lunar perigee, receiver setup). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens—tuning as a process of discarding assumptions, building through sensory layering toward the "shard of hush" resolution—and the pattern is taught. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elias discovers the signal's source (the fragment's Hollywood echo) and pockets it with quiet satisfaction, but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no price paid on the page. The final image ("every ending is just another frequency") restates the premise rather than reconfiguring it with felt consequence, yielding a Conceptual Repricing that remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately (Elijah, spectral grotto, sideways-running clocks), satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure—timelines merged, ferry now solid, hourglass filled—lacks visible cost; Elijah accomplishes his secret mission without on-page friction, sacrifice, or a moment where success was in doubt. The lens reads Causal (sequential ferry crossings leading to dimensional fusion), but the "because" chain is mechanical: he initiates, adjusts, guides, and succeeds without a reversal or price that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Siran attempts precision weaving → fails → shifts to abandon → corridor collapses, a clear because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (architect, gallery, sinew thread by ~80 words). The closure—collapse plus realization—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted ("burned away," "exhausted") rather than felt as a foreclosed path or altered tactic. The "blueprint of his next creation" line tells us closure has happened without showing what option was surrendered or what new constraint now binds him.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonance through the anchor-chain motif and stellar projections, but lacks a decisive on-page change or clear cost at closure. The ending image reweights the situation conceptually (teaching starlight navigation in a starless city) but Elias's stance and options remain unchanged from the opening—he was already committed to this course before the story began. The orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when by paragraph one), and causality within the lesson sequence is clean, but the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than dramatizing a moment where cost becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "incidental heroism" realization, but the cost remains abstract—gathering documents for authorities is stated intention, not on-page action with felt consequence. The drive lens reads Causal through the investigation sequence, though the hearing-aid mechanism strain credibility (Margaret was "deaf since birth" yet the device "contained recordings of faint pulses"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful turn occurs when the pulses lead to the hidden compartment, though the sister revelation arrives through document exposition rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (cables, gold fleck, phase transitions) and the final stanza reconfigures Eliza's state from solid explorer to liminal guardian. However, the closure unit—her dissolution into a new existence—occurs through passive transformation rather than protagonist choice, and the cost (leaving physical life) is asserted in retrospect rather than felt in the transition moment. The "return" action and tidal timeframe frame the piece but the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and clearly. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ink patterns and recurring heartbeat mentions accumulate toward a final reweighting. However, the closure unit—Elias finding "peace in the questions" and Aris requesting heartbeat reciprocity—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost only if we grant that "seventy-two and infinite" reweights survival versus loss; on the page, the cost remains abstract and the shift in stance is asserted more than dramatized. The piece coheres under its lens but the closure image does not unmistakably show what has been foreclosed or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, what by ~100 words). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (copper veins, bone towers, diamond, starlings) and the final moment reweights the "curse" as gift, shifting meaning with conceptual cost (the language transforms rather than dies). One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaelen harnesses echoes and syllables emerge. However, cost remains asserted rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page, which keeps this sub-8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: static-laden fragments → Jester's voice → phone metamorphosis → arrowhead drop. Closure lands as Charged Poise ("ready to turn grief into punchlines, or something more"), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The Orientation Test is borderline: "herbalist's underground garden" and "Elias" anchor who/where early, but the timeframe marker "after the missing return changed" remains vague background rather than active pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Jester reframes his sister's fate, though Elias's response (dropping the arrowhead) feels passive rather than forecloses a live path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: the locust shell's fall plants a vine that transforms the orchard and city, reweighting the premise of beauty versus mechanism. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "the gap between knowing and understanding" remains abstract until the shell appears. Causality holds (shell → playing → statues stir → city pauses → chord → statues crumble → shell planted → vine grows), but the statues' defeat feels dictated by symbolic necessity rather than earned tactical pressure. The Cost proof test is borderline: the shell's fragility and the violinist's defiance register, but the resolution delivers triumph without a visible forfeiture that alters her final state.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The inciting situation (shuttle arrival) → complication (drone surveillance) → climactic choice (EMP deployment and book shift) → closure (shuttle departs, gap created) flows with because/therefore linkage. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Kael has fostered the connection, the system will search the wrong space, and hope passes through—the final image crystallizes the cost of his method (one stone on a phantom road) and reconfigures the dominant stake without requiring the outcome to play out on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drone reaches zenith and forces the three-second window.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when solidify only after ~150 words of atmospheric preamble, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). The closure—Elian singing—reads as Decisive Change, but causality is weak: the halo fragment magically bestows voice without prior setup of what prevented speech or what internal barrier needed breaking. The "wrong turn" discovery and the fragment's touch operate as coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. One meaningful turn exists (finding the fragment), but the final transformation lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the librarian's concrete goal and the scene's spatial logic remain vague throughout (−0.4). No legible closure unit: the librarian "steps through" and "returns" with no on-page decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration of prior stakes—the "mission complete" is asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous (drifts among causal gestures, accumulative atmosphere, and concept-first abstraction) and never resolves to a coherent mode at closure. The "reawakening" is told as summary rather than enacted with visible cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors are delayed and vague: "whispering archipelago" and "odd-hour librarian" float without grounding who, where, or when by ~120 words; applying −0.4. The piece declares a quest but offers no on-page reversal, complication, or cost that narrows options—the palette simply works, the dream responds, and the archipelago is healed in a summary cascade. Closure reads as announced success rather than a felt change with visible price. Drive lens is ambiguous (lyric decoration suggests Accumulative, but the text never teaches a pattern or pays off compression); applying −0.4 and capping all categories at 8.0 per lens-ambiguity cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds toward the "soundless snap" release. Orientation anchors late—"workshop," "workbench," and "nexus under starlight" remain vague past 120 words, but the piece teaches a lyric pattern early enough to waive full penalty. The closure unit (ribbon losing color, secrets gone) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture of the locksmith's resources or future capacity. The final image reweights the lock of hair but does not foreclose a live option or demonstrate a felt price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (decades of return, pattern-mapping, light manifestation) and attempts Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara accepts her role. However, the closure unit is delivered almost entirely through tell: the light-beings explain her past and future task in dialogue, and her acceptance ("I'll help") lacks on-page cost or a legible before/after in tactics or options. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the second paragraph, so no penalty there. The causal link from studying constellations to light manifestation is present but the final turn hinges on convenient revelation rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens (exile → return → reunion) but the closure lacks visible cost: Marcus accepts the lesson and Elara's nervousness simply "dissipates." The Orientation Test is narrowly satisfied by paragraph two, but the exile itself is recounted rather than dramatized, so the return carries no friction. The final paragraph asserts completion ("succeeded in her mission") without an on-page change in options or a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the seed's germination fulfills Elianor's purpose and crystallizes "radiant hush" into a promise kept. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~60 words, meeting the test. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening—Elianor faces no on-page obstacle, complication, or cost that narrows her options. The resolution is achieved through uninterrupted ritual without friction, reducing the felt weight of the closure despite its thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: knots unravel sequentially, each releasing accumulated silence and spirits, building density toward the final revelation about collective grief. Orientation anchors adequately (prism sanctuary, Elias at work, Anna approaching) by the opening paragraph. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—grief as connection rather than confinement—but the cost remains abstract; the text asserts transformation without showing Elias or Anna foreclosing a live option or paying a visible price on the page. The POV slip ("I saw them daily") creates a causality hiccup that undermines trust in the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a causal structure but lacks meaningful reversal or tightening. Elias sets up equipment, aligns timestamps, performs a ritual, and succeeds—a linear sequence without complication. The closure offers no decisive change with visible cost; he "finds his purpose" through perception alone. Orientation is delayed (vault location, cathedral context, and great-grandfather's journals all arrive in fragments), applying the −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening beat and tracks a clear arc: Elias moves from analyzing three transmissions to abandoning his quest. The closure unit—"some threads aren't meant to be cut"—functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is announced rather than shown through foreclosed options. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic reprise (snow globe settling), yet the three-transmission structure feels illustrative rather than escalating under pressure. Arthur's departure signals finality, but the weight of "untold stories" in the penultimate beat arrives as assertion rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric details and the encoding process build density toward completion. Orientation anchors arrive late (~180 words before "courtyard above clouds" clarifies the where), triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (task completion and descent), but the cost is conceptual only—"another bridge between worlds strengthened"—without a visible price that forecloses options or alters tactics. The work is circular: he arrives to encode, encodes, departs satisfied, with no meaningful tightening or deepening of the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the Conceptual Repricing at closure—Elara inheriting a "legacy of finding joy beneath anguish"—lacks on-page cost; the diary author prepared everything, removing agency and price from the ending. The elevator's mechanical ascent provides a time structure, yet no reversal or tightening alters Elara's options; each floor simply reveals the next piece of exposition. The causal lens collapses when the goggles and diary solve themselves without Elara's struggle, and the final image asserts theme rather than dramatizing consequence. Cost proof fails: no sentence shows what Elara forfeits or risks by stepping through those doors.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story offers a Conceptual Repricing in the final image (clouds rearranging into a circle, "the sky remembers everything"), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. The cable snap occurs off-stage before the narrative opens, so the inciting event is backstory; the gondola's descent is passive drift with no on-page reversal driven by Elias's agency. Orientation anchors who and where early, but "after the string breaks" as timeframe remains vague—no countdown or escalating consequence tightens the drift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (building density through recurrent motifs), yet the closure image arrives as a convenient visual symbol rather than a pattern break that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative lens: Elias enters, unlocks the safe, assembles lenses, projects the sky, exits. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (he's "free," carries the sky inside him), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible trade-off, injury, or forfeiture shapes the final image. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by the opening lines). The dominant stake (mirror the sky before demolition) is signaled early, but the single tightening moment (wrecking ball strikes) arrives late and does not narrow options; Elias completes his work unimpeded, undercutting felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure is a summary of future intent ("tomorrow, when the airship docked, he would present his discovery") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The starling-hopscotch revelation arrives as intellectual realization without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off in the present scene. Orientation anchors (airship, observation deck, twilight) arrive early, but the causal chain reads as "and-then" discovery rather than because/therefore pressure. No felt price is legible in the final image; Elias simply folds his notes and becomes "guardian of a secret."

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "frozen library above clouds" and "lunar-eclipse locksmith" remain metaphoric rather than spatial or functional until past the first third. The closure—gears fusing into "a perfect mechanism"—lands as a told outcome rather than a dramatized reversal; no on-page beat shows *how* her assembly differs from mere description of the act. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design (mirrors pulse, fragments dissolve) but the final image ("she felt whole") summarizes emotional cost rather than making it legible through action or renunciation. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence at closure shows what she lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of chalk messages → network reveal). Orientation anchors arrive late: "Season of Falling Stars" and "orchard planet" appear early, but who Elara is and when "now" occurs remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing (the network's purpose reweights the ghost's guidance), but cost is told retrospectively across "seasons" and "years" rather than felt in a final image—no on-page forfeiture or crystallized poise moment. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern (early years → discovery sequence → final revelation → epilogue future), but the ending diffuses into summary rather than landing a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—no concrete spatial grounding or temporal anchor beyond "dusk" and metaphoric "final ripple." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the piece offers declarative summary rather than dramatized pressure accumulation. Closure presents a Conceptual Repricing (the lullaby preserving meaning), yet the cost is asserted ("transformed it") rather than shown through a before/after shift in the adjuster's options or state. The causality is a straight line with no reversal or tightening that narrows choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Tomas), where (orchard/cliffs), and what (curse/mechanical birds) within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal arc: assemble device → activate with blood gift → guide traveler out. Closure reads as continuation rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; Tomas returns to the orchard with dimmed light described as "approval," but no option is foreclosed and no price visible on the page beyond "first frost kisses touched Tomas's fingertips," which reads atmospheric rather than consequential. Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure, but the ending deflates into summary ("another night, another life saved") rather than landing a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: ravine observation → insight → laboratory action → delivery to Marco. However, the central closure—presenting the new polymer to Marco—occurs in summary ("Days later, when she presented...") rather than on the page, undercutting the cost and transformation. The insight beat ("as the pieces fall into place") functions as the pivot, but the river-foam metaphor does the causal work rather than dramatized pressure, and the laboratory synthesis is elided entirely, leaving the before/after legible but the felt cost absent from the closure moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after ~180 words, well past the ~120-word anchor gate, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece presents accumulative texture—recurring bottles, repeated incisions—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the second customer is a copy-paste of the first with no escalation in stakes or knowledge. Closure offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing: Elias ends exactly where he began ("his clean slate untroubled"), the bottles accumulate without reweighting prior material, and the final image ("bottles of bottled moonlight gleaming like a constellation of lost chances") decorates rather than costs. Under an Accumulative lens, the pattern teaches recursion but delivers stasis without felt pressure or cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the drive lens reads Causal (goal pursuit → method → subsumption → relief). The closure—Kael absorbs the pavilion's remorse and his specific memories dull—lands on the page, but the cost is underspecified: he can now cook without tasting his parents' deaths, yet the text declares "emotional contagion in his touch had lessened" without dramatizing what that loss or change forecloses. The sequence is motivated (gift → dreams → rain → tidal pool → pavilion → absorption → return), yet the middle lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Kael's descent proceeds without a second decision or complication that narrows options. Closure fits Decisive Change structurally, but the "felt cost" test is not satisfied on the page—relief is granted, trade-offs are asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure unit: the story summarizes outcomes (fifteen cooperative agreements, three festivals, a charter) rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or final image that reweights prior material with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by early lines, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is largely expository; the broadcast sequence and farmer responses are told in summary, not shown through because/therefore linkage. The ending reports results rather than landing a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.8)
    No legible closure unit appears. The piece opens with Elara already at the canyon, already transformed, already equipped, and ends with her "already planning her next expedition"—a pure status quo. The "archeologist of abandoned dreams" frame is announced in paragraph six and never tested; no decision narrows options, no reversal changes knowledge. The drive lens cannot be inferred because no pressure accumulates: she activates equipment, witnesses visions, records findings, and packs up without friction. Orientation is delayed until paragraph three (neural interface mention), but the larger failure is the absence of any decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid; the grotto crossing is motivated but closure lacks visible cost. Orientation anchors appear by ~80 words (library → city → quarries) within tolerance. The central causal thread holds—margin doodle signals grotto, gravity inversion permits entry, crystals deliver knowledge—but the ending awards full success without on-page price: Elara returns unscathed with "seeds of vigilance" boxed and her work "only begun," deferring consequence entirely off-page. The structural turn (discovery of crystals) happens on schedule but resolves without foreclosing options or altering stance in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors orientation adequately (tree-song sculptor, siskin alder grove, quest for silenced sculpture) within the opening paragraph. However, the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: Eliara accomplishes her goal, departs satisfied, and the final lines assert future repetition without on-page consequence or foreclosed path. The narrative follows a linear fulfillment arc—she seeks, finds, succeeds—but no reversal, renunciation, or reconfiguration reweights prior material. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is thin; under Accumulative, the final image restates rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~40 words (pass). The piece accumulates reflective texture but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost at closure—Elias arrives seeking understanding and departs with understanding, a static trajectory. The "eclipsed covenant" and his exile are summarized rather than dramatized, so no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The story tells us he has found peace but does not show what he renounced or paid to reach it. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and follows a single continuous scene with clear goal pursuit (unlock the diary). However, the closure—clasp clicks open, Silen smiles—lacks visible cost or consequence; the diary opening doesn't alter options or foreclose a path, it merely completes the task. The narrative is Causal in structure (frequency adjustments → clasp responds → opens) but the final beat offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence makes the cost of this achievement legible.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients quickly (treetop village, herbalist, seed) and attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens through the months-long cultivation ritual. However, the closure—Elara's realization that wisdom lay in process and community—arrives as articulated insight rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the corpse flower's wilt and seed-sharing carry no forfeiture or trade-off that alters her stance. The montage structure compresses key beats into summary ("seasons turned," "seven months"), obscuring the tightening or deepening required for high-band closure. The inferred lens holds loosely, but the ending reads more as thematic Echo than reweighted particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, *Gleaner*, Xylos orchard, gravity inversion hour) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: water-flow navigation → arrow-tip discovery → growth acceleration → central tree with tamed energy. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arrow tip hums and the sapling surges, narrowing Kael's tactical focus to the orchard's core. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"the orchard had taken a wound and turned it into strength"—but the cost remains conceptual and off-page ("vulnerability" declared, not dramatized). The ~120-word orientation window is met, so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but the closure cost is asserted rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored by ~120 words, waiving that penalty. Drive lens reads as Causal investigation, but the closure lands as summary documentation ("When rescue teams arrived...") rather than on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The convergence discovery is told retrospectively in the penultimate paragraph without visible cost or altered options for Elias. The final paragraph shifts to future tense and external perspective, deflating any present-tense closure effect. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows Elias paying a price or forecloses a path at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, tracking synesthetic density toward a resonance moment. Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words, acceptable. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the cavern sings back, wonder certified), but the cost is absent—nothing is traded, risked, or foreclosed on the page. The bell ringer simply performs, succeeds, and leaves satisfied. The ending asserts transformation ("wonder was irrevocably renewed") without demonstrating felt consequence or a before/after legible through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: the Keeper, Thunder-echo range, post-guardianship timeframe. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds through the journey, the veil thins, and the final image reweights the burden from "crushing weight to manageable mass." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the Keeper's relationship to failure transforms), but the cost is told rather than shown—"the avalanchingly quiet burden begin to shift" summarizes the change without a concrete forfeiture or visible price paid on the page. The journey's causal spine is legible, yet the pivotal understanding ("guardianship had failed not from weakness but from rigidity") arrives as reflective insight rather than through on-page dramatic pressure, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by ~120 words. The closure unit—Silas joining the collective—lacks visible cost; he gains connection without forfeiting calculation or autonomy on the page. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is present but undermined by causal convenience: the halo fragment operates of its own accord, the press prints unbidden, and a dozen others arrive without setup. Drive lens ambiguity persists at closure between lyric reconfiguration and causal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the pendant's vibrations build through encounters (hare, hermit, dawn realization) to reweight the courier's understanding of his mentor's teaching. However, closure lacks a legible cost—the final image asserts transformation ("moved differently now," "warmed against his chest") without showing what path has been foreclosed or what price paid. The hermit's vanishing and the auroras' fading gesture toward consequence but remain atmospheric rather than causally tightening the courier's options. The piece deepens thematic understanding but does not land a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a continuous scene (arbor to car) with clear spatial anchors and a single dominant stake: proving emotional absorption. Closure operates as Conceptual Repricing—Elias pockets the prism with his conviction deepened—but the cost remains abstract ("truthful lies he would tell himself") rather than a legible forfeiture or reweighted relationship. The causality is internally consistent but thin: light refracts, he feels vibrations, impressions arrive, certainty follows. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the final image could reconfigure meaning, yet the "profound discovery" is asserted more than earned through on-page pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" and "loom spinner" are labels without spatial or temporal anchors by 120 words, and the disorientation does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4. The closure unit is a Charged Poise attempt (she "threaded a needle through its seams," prepared to weave again), but the cost is asserted ("sacrifice was latent," "trembling hands") rather than shown as a forfeited option or altered relationship. The piece cycles through weaving, collapse, rising, and re-commitment without a causal because/therefore link or a meaningful tightening that narrows her choices. Drive lens unclear: lyric texture suggests Accumulative, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake at the end—apply lens-ambiguity penalty −0.4 and cap all categories at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words; no penalty. The closure unit—Elias raises the restored arch at dawn,villagers react, Elias returns "purposefully transformed"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: the text tells us he feels "quiet satisfaction" without showing what path he has foreclosed or what trade-off he now carries. The magician's silk's mechanics ("bartered awakenings," "extracted latent potential") remain abstract; the story never specifies what Elias surrenders in the barter beyond three months' wages mentioned in backstory. Accumulative pressure builds through meticulous fragment collection and the cavern ritual, yet the final image delivers wonder (children pause, elders shield eyes) without legible personal or social cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece attempts a causal lens: shard touch → world-shift → datapad nudge → log resurfaces. However, the closure unit—"withheld truth was no longer a whisper; it was a stone"—is abstract declaration rather than on-page decisive change with visible cost. The log's resurfacing happens off-stage ("a new whisper crept into his senses"), and Kael never opens it or acts on its weight; the ending summarizes emotional resolution ("ghosts...had fallen silent") without a legible before/after in choice or consequence. Cost is asserted ("painful terminus") but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (letters, sea glass, stone stacking) layer toward a final reconfiguration. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—Jonah's understanding shifts from solitary watchfulness to acknowledged connection—but the cost remains abstract ("weight of his reticence lifted ever so slightly") rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the dock scene. The escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than a causal tightening, which fits the lens, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the stone-stacking and sea glass placement read as thematic echo rather than a moment that makes a before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (ritual repetition, shadowplay motifs), but no decisive pattern-break or cadence shift tightens pressure or reweights the stake at closure. The ending rehearses the same routine described throughout—"another night," "routine would continue"—without visible cost or foreclosed path. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph, avoiding penalty. However, the "accidentally prophetic" headlines and shadow-steering remain abstract claims with no on-page consequence that alters Kaelen's options or the world's response, leaving closure as static recapitulation rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The weeks-long tracking ritual builds density through repeated observation until the prism-refracted light creates a pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elian moves from seeking the donor's identity to embodying their practice, with the cost felt in the replacement of one compulsion by another. The orientation is clear (watchful dye master, floating tea house, post-transplant) and the accumulative pressure coheres. Minor slip: the prism alignment feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior tracking data.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (maintenance worker, labyrinth corridors, sextant discovery) arrive early. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge that trees absorb human emotions), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The storm-tower sequence attempts a climactic turn, yet the breakthrough ("trees take in human emotions as they did sunlight and rain") lands as explained insight rather than a choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present (months of dream-mapping coalesce), but the final image (Elian resuming duties, smiling) does not reweight prior pressure with undeniable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (mica window, phosphorescent trees, glowing blooms) toward a final reconfiguration where light spills into the streets and the townsfolk begin to sing. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror world shifts from endless night toward dawn, songs return), but cost remains conceptual and implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—the keeper's chest aches and his role feels lighter, yet no concrete path is foreclosed. Orientation anchors who and where by the second sentence, though "mirror world" and "alchemical orchard" remain high-concept placeholders. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper's voice joins the lute and the music breaches the greenhouse walls, narrowing from solitary attempt to communal awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building through reflection and ritual toward a cadence shift at departure—but the closure lacks felt cost; Elara's exit is framed as recognition and offering rather than foreclosing a live option with visible price. The piece teaches a reflective mode early and holds it, but the final image ("her compassion no longer a retreat but an offering") asserts transformation without demonstrating what was surrendered or altered on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the ritual preparations tighten her resolve) but the cost remains conceptual and soft.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details, symbolic objects (bread, seeds, tea house), and atmospheric density build toward a mood-based reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive late—"secret tea house" and "overgrown palace courtyard" appear well past the opening, and the timeframe "after the birds fly south" is referenced only once without grounding the present moment's temporal position. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world "hadn't ended; it had only changed"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page choice or forfeiture is visible in the final image. The chirping bird and blooming wildflowers feel asserted rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is clear early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara measures vows while the Great Forgetting approaches. However, no decisive change or felt cost lands on the page—she completes her task without complication, and the final paragraph declares success via summary rather than dramatizing a reweighted image or foreclosed path. The closure unit is missing; the ending reports completion rather than reconfiguring options or meaning with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a because/therefore chain: Silas's betrayal → Emmie's three attempts → final success with recording → choice to preserve the truce. Closure is a Decisive Change (she gains evidence and chooses strategic revelation over exposure), but the cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt on the page—"she decided" summarizes rather than dramatizes the final trade-off. The three "false starts" function as plot moves but lack distinct tactical evolution; each failure feels like a beat repetition rather than a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Orientation is clean and the lens holds, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the opening third without early clarity (−0.4). No meaningful on-page closure under any lens: Elara's discovery that "carrying weather wasn't a strange side effect" is told epiphany, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in intent but lacks a cadence shift or pattern break at the ending that reweights prior material—the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than charging an image. Causality is weak: the compass leads her to him, but their meeting produces no choice or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through symbolic objects (charcoal, box, painting) toward a final image of reclaimed creativity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts his calling), but the cost is asserted ("weight of his decision settling in") rather than legibly paid through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. Orientation is clear early (cave, artist, exile). The Orientation Test is waived. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; no meaningful tightening of options occurs between the box discovery and the final sketching.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: map discovery → postal hub exploration → plate fragments → revelation → message distribution. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through community candor blooming, but the cost remains abstract—"wilted parts...remained faded" tells us loss occurred off-page rather than showing a specific, visible price paid in the final image. The council's prior suppression provides setup, but Elara's final act (sending messages) faces no on-page resistance or trade-off that would charge the ending with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—"whispering bluff above the clouds" anchors location but "who" remains vague ("bell tuner, whose name had long been lost") and "when" ("after words became unnecessary") stays abstract past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece follows an observational, descriptive arc without a legible causal turn or escalation: the tuner positions the fragment, adjusts a lever, watches it melt—no decision narrows options or changes knowledge. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual only ("the color of wonder would endure") without visible forfeiture on the page. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the density does not meaningfully shift at the end; the final image repeats prior assertions rather than reweighting them.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (roses, static, glass dome, fear-seed) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is adequate—who, where, when anchor within the first hundred words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (integration of fears into protective membranes, L-734 walking away with a seed), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "having burned away the prison of fear without escaping what made it whole" tells the transformation without showing the trade-off. The magnetic-north complication and controlled-burn mechanics remain atmospheric rather than causally tight, reducing closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into coincidence daisy-chain: locket → mailbox → neighbors → elm → library, each step unlocking the next with no protagonist agency narrowing options. The closure—gathering neighbors to unlock the mailbox and distribute letters—resolves a problem Elias did not help create; Mrs. Leclair's archive was complete before he arrived. No on-page cost is legible: the final image ("hope," "guardian of whispers") asserts healing without showing what Elias sacrificed or altered. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalty, but the and-then sequencing and off-stage resolution (Mrs. Leclair's illness, the archive's creation) break causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present (underwater lab, Elara, encryption mission) but the closure—mentor freed via dice sequence and dance—arrives through coincidence and symbolic gesture rather than earned causality. The phoenix image declares success but the cost is never dramatized on the page; we're told the system flashed colors, not shown what Elara forfeited or risked in that final beat. The Drive Lens wobbles between Causal (code-breaking) and Accumulative (symbolic dance/dice), settling on neither with conviction. Applying Orientation Test: anchors land early, waiver applies; no penalty here, but closure cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines (lantern lighter, harbor, twilight after whale beaching). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: coffee grounds map gravity pockets, wildflowers anchor the ritual, salt crystals amplify retrieval. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration when memories surface and wildflowers become "vibrant with the energy of returned experience," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, altered relationship, or foreclosed path. The retrievals happen in summary ("by dawn, Elara had exhumed seventeen memories") without scene pressure or a visible price paid during the act itself, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain abstract until well past 120 words ("solitary summoner," "nocturnal haven" are generic placeholders without spatial anchors). The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures at Accumulative/Textural (layered silence imagery) but lacks a decisive tightening or cost-laden reconfiguration at closure. The ending summarizes triumph ("the prophecy was hushed") without on-page cost or a before/after legible through action. Causality is present but the closure unit dissolves into assertion rather than dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is established early (rooftop, tutor, Elias). The story follows a causal lens: lie → tea sessions → interrogation → revelation → shared listening. However, the transition from rooftop to study ("they were in her study now, though they'd been on the roof moments ago") is unmotivated and breaks spatial causality. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (shared understanding replaces lies) but the cost is asserted rather than shown—what does she forfeit by revealing the secret?

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (garden, twilight, Elena with seashell) and the closure unit—archived memories allowing Elena to walk free—lands on the page. However, causality is thin: the seashell instructs, Elena obeys, and the garden "participates" without clear cost or constraint. The final transformation ("isolation transmuted into the foundation of her independence") reads as conceptual repricing, but the price is told rather than shown in a decisive image. Under a hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative ritual), the ending reconfigures meaning, yet the walk-through feels summary rather than a crystallized moment with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors by paragraph two (forger, sanctuary, three winters). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara completes the forgery and steps into daylight feeling "lighter," breaking the cycle through deception—but the cost remains abstract ("unlinked her past") rather than a specific forfeiture legible in the final image. The drive lens reads Causal (forgery enables revenge/justice), yet the ending avoids showing whether the document will work or what Elara loses by choosing this path, leaving consequence implied rather than paid on the page. The "key with no apparent lock" metaphor arrives as a late flourish rather than a mechanism that shaped earlier attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Kaelen gathers evidence through song, the canyon amplifies, the Spire trembles, panic rises. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page change or visible cost—Kaelen simply "stepped back from the edge" after the warning is delivered, and the "shouts of panic" are ambient rather than a reconfiguration that alters his options or stance. The ending offers thematic reflection ("people echo when they refuse to be silenced") but does not land a felt cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: Elara discovers Nikolaus's message, then plants truth in the director's dreams, leading to investigation. However, the closure—"another spirit found peace"—summarizes consequence rather than showing a decisive on-page change or felt cost; the director's awakening and subsequent investigation occur off-stage. Themelted snow globe facilitates connection but its mechanics remain vague, and the final paragraph loops back to readiness without transformation. One meaningful tightening (Nikolaus reveals company negligence) narrows knowledge, but the resolution is asserted, not dramatized, leaving cost implied rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of lyric resonance (whispering parapet → tea whisk → fireflies → loom → return) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara's perception is "forever altered." However, the cost is asserted ("demure audacity had not been in vain") rather than shown through a decision that forecloses an option. Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The accumulation deepens understanding, but the final image lacks felt or visible sacrifice—she simply gains insight and returns unchanged in circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: progressive discovery through letter reassembly builds toward a final reweighting. However, the closure unit—Maya's decision to "excavate truth" rather than debunk—is stated in the final paragraphs as retrospective summary without an on-page moment where cost or consequence becomes visible. The orientation test passes (who, where, when anchored early), and the two-shard structure (orchard exploration → letter reconstruction) is legible, but the final reconfiguration lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (flawed perfection as balance) but the cost remains abstract rather than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words, waiving the penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers symbolic elements (storm, cobalt glass, radio frequencies, Maren's chalk circles) and tightens through a cadence shift when Elias alters the frequencies, culminating in a renunciation (leaving the observatory). The closure—descent and acceptance of "variant allegiance"—lands on the page with a conceptual repricing: shadow and light must coexist. However, the cost is abstract ("the world would remember neither his name nor his sacrifice") rather than felt or visible in a concrete forfeiture, falling short of undeniable pressure. The "exactly as intended" line undercuts ambiguity and stakes, suggesting control rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation quickly (feral loft, dawn, dunes) and establishes a clear before/after: Silas moves from capturing ambient desert sounds to preserving human memory. However, the closure is partly asserted rather than dramatized—"gleaned redemption" and "exactly what he was meant to be" arrive as narrative summary in the final paragraph, diluting the image's charge. The accumulative lens holds (each jar builds the repository), but cost is conceptual and implied rather than visibly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening sentence. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ritual unfolds through description and atmosphere rather than reversals. Closure registers as Conceptual Repricing—the marina transforms from graveyard to cathedral, the artifact is safe—but the cost remains abstract ("vigilance renewed") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option on the page. The "because/therefore" chain is weak; the key does its work without resistance or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors are established, but the causal through-line is diffuse—three lunar cycles pass in summary, and the "complete pattern" arrives without prior tightening or reversal that changes Elara's options. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (a wave of patience spreads), but cost is asserted rather than shown: no visible price paid, no path foreclosed on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending lacks a decisive density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.6)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when are anchored early, but the closure lacks on-page cost. The protagonist walks deeper into the tunnel and then "stepped out...into the light of a new day"—a metaphorical declaration rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt consequence. The investigation premise (rusted panel, cut wires, inscription) sets up a mystery but resolves through narrated realization ("she understood") instead of dramatized action or forfeiture. Under a Causal lens the because/therefore chain breaks at closure; under Accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: Silas's dying words → Elias seeks second opinion → Anja reveals trap → disarmament → redefined delivery. The reversal (apology-as-trap) is well-motivated and the closure lands with conceptual cost (Elias's trust was weaponized). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The ticking pressure and one-hour countdown create tangible stakes, and the final reassembly forecloses the trap with visible action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who: cart glider Zephyr; where: floating workshop; when: present continuous) arrive by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—ringing the Silent Bell—is signaled early but the closure remains off-page: Zephyr descends toward the bell with the vibrating arrow, yet no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The final sentence ("the bell would ring soon, changing everything") is a promissory note, not closure with visible cost. Drive lens reads Causal (because/therefore: algorithm → curiosity → arrow examination → map discovery → descent), but the ending delivers setup for a future turn rather than an on-page reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a mystery-investigation structure with clear causal linkage (2319 → patch → Thorne → hidden files → song), and the final choice to broadcast constitutes a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (empire vs. revolution). However, the orientation test passes only marginally—"corporate memory keeper for EchoVerse" and "the Archive" anchor role and place, but the physical environment remains vague until deep into the text. The closure lands on the page but the cost is conceptual and stated ("protect an empire built on scarcity") rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or visible consequence in the final beat. Lens is Causal throughout and holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails the orientation test: by ~120 words the reader has dimension-shifting, lighthouse orchard, tundral ice, crystalline fruit, and shadow-stitched silk without anchoring who Shael is in immediate sensory terms or what specific problem the weighted breath addresses. The closure—two children sharing a path shown in the reconstituted crystal—lands as summary rather than a resonant image with on-page cost; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The Council's question ("Tell us what comes next") is answered by declaration ("Equality") without dramatizing the price of that answer or the stakes of delay.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (Arthur), where (drift-ice marina), and when (after waking changed, now in disaster aftermath) within the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Arthur sought the frequency of finality but discovers "the sound of what continues," reweighting his quest with the felt cost that he must now engage with endurance rather than escape. The woman's shanty provides the textural turn that shifts meaning. One minor causality slip: Arthur's decision to become a "euthanasia tourist" and then pivot to disaster relief lacks on-page motivation for the second move—told as fact rather than dramatized choice—creating a small gap in the causal chain before the marina arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (patterns of arranged objects, recurring motifs), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the couple simply moves from separation to hand-holding without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an option. The burned letter and arranged leaves function as props rather than causal agents; the sentinel's "method" never encounters resistance. Closure is asserted ("their work done") rather than enacted through a decisive change or felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with attempts at intensification through repetition (two consecrations, parapet surges), but no meaningful tightening occurs—the second consecration simply expands the first without cost or friction. The clearing "crystallizes," the parapet "completes," and the walker leaves "at peace" without any legible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Orientation anchors who and where early, waiving that penalty, but the closure offers only declarative satisfaction: "the echo of wisdom lived on." Cost is asserted in phrases like "weight of his purpose" but never dramatized through a visible trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens through its layered photographs, but the closure—Elias seeing the mural and knowing "this was just the beginning"—offers no visible cost or decisive change; the final image is purely affirming without foreclosing any option or altering his stance. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when clear by the second paragraph), but the ending delivers arrival without sacrifice, and the "purpose fulfilled" declaration tells rather than dramatizes closure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the arcs simply coalesce without Elias paying a price or making a choice that narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by line two. The piece accumulates through crystal-mediated sound memories that deepen the scholar's understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): he grasps his role as witness and claims the crystal with resolve. Cost is conceptual—the shift from analyzer to witness—but the price feels asserted rather than visibly paid through forfeited options on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who and where within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring chalk motif, and the ritual's progression toward the monolith. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elias "finally captured his fleeting prize," but we don't see what he forfeited, what option closed, or how his condition changed as a result. The ending reads as completion rather than reconfiguration or repricing. Under the chosen lens, a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost is required; here the final image affirms success without undeniable pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality shatters at the climax: timing a clock hand to a leaf's whisper somehow "recalibrates velocity" and "stabilizes trajectory" of an entire orbital station without mechanical linkage shown on-page. The Orientation Test passes (Kael, lunar observatory, present tense established early), but the closure effect—station saved—rests on unexplained magic rather than dramatized cause-effect. The inferred lens (Causal) collapses when the protagonist's action (adjusting clock tension by "infinitesimal degrees" while listening to a leaf) produces macro-scale orbital correction with no intermediary steps. Cost is asserted ("bones ache," "collapsed") but not tied to a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrue around the broken record, the melody, and the symbolic placement. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the vinyl shard placed in the sleeve; "the scent of hope" restated), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The "flawless goodbye" arrives without friction, undercutting the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who/where/when) within the opening paragraph and follows a causal chain: key insertion → rune activation → fissure opens → shadow entity appears → loops sealed → resolution. However, the central mechanism—"closing loops"—arrives as solution without prior failed attempts or visible cost; Elara slams her palm and the problem resolves in a single move. The closure unit (shadows exiled, one loop closed) lands on the page, but the felt cost is oblique: exhaustion and the statement "her work was far from over" tell rather than show what path was foreclosed. The drive lens reads Causal with a Situational overlay (external pressure forces stance), but the final beat lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the tooth, garden, and Merrick's teaching form a pattern that reweights at closure when Eleanor surrenders the tooth and gains understanding. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands on the page with felt cost—the tooth dissolves, the cleft heals by "expanding into understanding," and Eleanor's certainty shifts. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (Eleanor, her office, yesterday's case, then the garden). The cost is legible in "the cleft in certainty begin to heal, not by closing but by expanding," though the phrasing tilts abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere through lyric density and pattern (zephyr bloom, serpentine coils, pearl of stillness), but no on-page tightening or reversal changes Elara's options or knowledge. The closure—placing polished sea glass on a ledge—delivers the promised action but without felt or conceptual cost; she departs "light" and "earthbound no longer in spirit," a summary claim rather than a visible foreclosure. Orientation penalty waived (grotto, shoreline, stars anchored early), but the absence of escalation and legible cost at closure caps the category.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's sanctuary visit deepens through Maya's arrival, creating a pattern of shared refuge that the ending reprises. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the sanctuary "expands rather than diminishes," which suggests addition without trade-off. The viral confession timeframe creates context but doesn't tighten on-page decisions; three weeks have passed with no urgency forcing this particular encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (novelist, misty nexus, dream-time) within the first 120 words and holds a recognizable Accumulative lens: the protagonist collects hopes that later fuel his writing. However, the closure—returning to write with collected hopes—lacks a visible cost or meaningful foreclosure; he simply gains what he sought without trade-off. The mid-section collecting beats feel repetitive (poet, musician, child) without escalation, and the final paragraph asserts transformation ("broken vessel...conduit") rather than demonstrating a reweighted stance through image or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, verdant arbor, dawn, harvest moon) arrive early, but the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost on the page. The cricket simply complies, the vine blooms, and Elias weeps in relief—outcome declared, not earned through a causal turn that forecloses a live option. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece layers moon-song-vine imagery but does not tighten or deepen pressure into a reweighting that makes a before/after legible with felt price. The "work done" moment bypasses dramatized friction, and the final "ready to spin new golden stories" resets rather than closes with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: starlight poured, spread, rearranged, sealed—a layered ritual without causal reversals. Orientation anchors arrive late (subarctic crater, Kaelen's role) and remain abstract; the ~120-word window test fails, warranting −0.4. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the map becomes "not an ending but a beginning," reweighting the orchard's state. Cost is conceptual (continuity of knowledge preserved against darkness) but legible in the final resin-sealing image. One meaningful deepening—starlight accepting the heartbeat imprint—occurs, satisfying the lens, but the effect remains muted by expository framing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchors (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure—Elian removing and storing the crystal—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and somewhat abstract ("something was always lost in healing"). The narrative traces a steady progression from broken mechanism to repair to harvest, with one meaningful deepening when the timer captures "not just sound, but the full resonance." However, the causality is smooth to the point of being frictionless; no reversal or complication tests Elian's path.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the first third and signals a clear stake: Elara's transformation to collect burdens. However, the closure unit—her becoming a permanent vessel after collecting 4,817 burdens—arrives without visible cost; the calcification is framed as fulfillment rather than sacrifice, and no prior option is foreclosed on the page. The causal lens weakens when "boundary-lessly trapped" shifts from metaphor to literal constraint without dramatized consequence. The ending recounts completion ("her work...never complete, only temporarily paused") but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and pattern reinforcement (rain, rust-hued peace, carving gestures) that reweights the dominant stake of transforming grief into artifact. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed carving as both "record and resurrection," with felt cost in the acceptance that memory becomes object. Orientation anchors (loft, workbench, kettle) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure "seemed almost alive," crystallizing the paradox. Minor slip: the cost could be more viscerally legible in the final image rather than stated in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through lyric repetition and symbolic deepening rather than causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—Elias stepping beyond the lagoon, ghost fading, regret left behind—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "the ghost was gone, and so was the regret" tells the shift without showing forfeiture or tactical change. The final image reweights prior motifs yet the price paid remains conceptual and diffuse, weakening the closure's felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader learns "abandoned spaceport terminal" in the opening line but "after the carnival left town" arrives as metaphor rather than literal timeframe, causing brief disorientation (−0.3 per Orientation Test). The closure unit—water flowing through channels to create "equations for hope"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the story declares transformation without showing what Elara risks or loses. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern layering toward a resonant image), but the final image recycles prior abstractions ("maze of intentions," "threshold") without reweighting them through a concrete before/after change. No visible cost at closure; the terminal "hums," but Elara's options and the world's state remain unchanged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates through description and reflection toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elian stops avoiding the forecourt and accepts the music within). However, the cost is largely told ("no longer just a clock scribe") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic. The closure reweights prior material but the price remains abstractly claimed rather than legibly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from chasing treasure to understanding the human architecture behind the myth, with visible cost (his career's premise dissolves). The causal lens holds—preparation with sundial and current-reading leads to discovery, which recontextualizes his quest. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who: Elias; where: barge canal; when: pre-dawn). One meaningful deepening occurs when the chest reveals schematics instead of jewels, forcing a conceptual shift that charges the final image of the sundial as truth-instrument versus the engineer's dream-blueprint.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and moves through a single encounter on the dock. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—atmosphere and image density thicken until the weaver appears and the rope "weaves itself" into meaning. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the weaver simply hands back the fulgurite "cool and dormant," Elias secures it, and leaves with new knowledge but no dramatized trade-off or path foreclosed. The final snow and fog resumption offer mood but not a legible reconfiguration with felt price. Without cost proof at the ending beat, the Resonant Reconfiguration does not fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a reflective/accumulative lens and holds it through to closure. Orientation is clear (traveler, island garden, post-departure isolation). The closure offers a conceptual repricing of healing-as-integration, but the cost remains abstract—Elias finishes his work "profoundly lonely and breathtakingly present" without a prior setup showing what loneliness forecloses or what presence demands he relinquish. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows his options; the ending recapitulates the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who (Kael), where (suspended palace), and what (reawakening the egg) by the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure—cracking the egg and the palace falling—occurs almost entirely through summary and lyric assertion ("the bird's song was the only thing that mattered") rather than a dramatized beat that shows the decisive change with concrete cost. Under a Causal lens, the linkage from assembly to creature-birth to palace-collapse reads compressed and convenient; under an Accumulative lens, the final image restates the opening premise without a felt tightening or new constraint that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through interwoven images (lagoon, sand, coin, sapling) toward a final resonant tableau. Orientation is present by the opening lines (who, where, when), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the ending restates the premise ("from ashes, something beautiful") without a felt price or shift in options. One meaningful deepening via the coin-tying ritual is present, but it does not narrow tactics or foreclose a path—it decorates the symbolic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and follows a loose Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael collects breadcrumbs (cherub, coin, ripples, sapling) that converge at the box's opening. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the box "snapped open" with "the soft sigh of a released breath," memories are "freed," and Kael walks away smiling, having "unstick himself." No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the resolution is purely additive. The breadcrumbs function as a treasure hunt rather than pressure escalation, and the final image offers satisfaction without reconfiguration or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who/where/when remains abstract past the 120-word mark; the nebula garden is atmosphere without spatial anchors, and "the sentimentalist" lacks concrete embodiment until well into the piece (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the gear integrated, patterns shifted), but the causal chain is vague: the gear "began to glow" and "whirred" without clear mechanism, and the sentimentalist's light-sharing is described in metaphor ("weaving strands of photon") that obscures the actual action. Cost is asserted ("joy and loss," "purpose fulfilled yet altered") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered images of butterflies, ribbon, and stone deepen across the evening until the final carving gesture reweights the opening meditation on grief. Orientation anchors (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, carving work) arrive promptly. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the carved migration path and unrolled ribbon poem crystallize his understanding—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("a connection, a fierce and quiet understanding") rather than felt or forfeited on the page. No visible price or foreclosed path; the ending tells us he has found what he sought without dramatizing what he gave up or left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the single-scene window and single POV align with scope defaults. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias's penance is absorbed into the clock's motion, foreclosing his shame), and the accumulative/textural lens holds—density builds through layered reflection and the final image reweights the stake. Cost is present but oblique: the "ghost of his failure finally beginning to fade" implies relief rather than a visible price paid or option lost on the page, weakening the felt consequence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when by line 3). The piece attempts Causal structure: Elias notices frayed threads → isolates Foster's knot → decodes the promise → releases the echo. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Foster's thread "reconstitutes itself" without Elias forfeiting anything or facing a consequence that narrows future options. The ending offers resolution without a decisive change or visible price, weakening the closure unit required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but what constitutes the inciting pressure or stake remains vague—there is no dramatized problem the cartographer must solve, only a self-assigned task to "write the future." The piece unfolds as a series of poetic tableaux (climb, pause, write, descend) without causal linkage or a reversal that narrows options; the lake cracks and thaws in response to his writing, but this feels like ambient magic rather than earned consequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of thawed water and uncharted sky, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible—his "ignorance replaced by quiet confidence" reads as pure gain, violating the cost requirement. Drive lens is ambiguous (Accumulative/Textural gestures via imagery, but no pattern is taught or paid off), and the ending does not reconfigure prior material with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who Elias is and where he works emerge gradually across the opening third, though the alcove and radio are signaled early. The story follows an accumulative lens—lyric fragments coalesce into instruction, dust responds to song—and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the hall transforms from tomb to library, Elias shifts from copyist to composer). Cost is implied in the broadcast's disappearance and the crystal's dimming, but the final image offers renewal without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the crystal hum becomes instruction, but the causal chain relies on convenient magic rather than constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear within the first paragraph (Elias, vanishing point gallery, rocking chair as time marker). The story sustains an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mask's transformation through ash application gathers density and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts fragility and finds "a reason to keep going." Cost is legible but oblique: the mirage dissolves, leaving only the truth. The closure lands on the page, yet the causality is thin—powdering the mask doesn't foreclose an alternate path or test a live dilemma, only completes a preordained ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: the opening offers "labyrinth beneath what remained of Alexandria" and "six years after the plague" but who Sebastian is and his immediate spatial anchor arrive slowly, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sedimentary excavation, layered discoveries), but the closure—emerging with waterproof pack—feels like a physical escape rather than a meaningful tightening or conceptual repricing; the "truth survives in fragments" assertion is told, not reweighted by the final image. Cost at closure is vague: what exactly does Sebastian forfeit by surfacing? The piece teaches a pattern of archaeological discovery but does not land a decisive reconfiguration with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (library, autumn, Eleanor's role). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final lamp-lighting and placement of the rosette, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page renunciation or foreclosed path with visible price. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the rehearsal sequence summarizes transformation ("they felt the change") rather than dramatizing a single tightening choice that narrows Eleanor's options or forces a trade-off. Causality is clean but the closure image reweights prior material only weakly, lacking the undeniable pressure required for strong RR.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who, where, when). The story teaches an Accumulative lens through cosmic-alignment framing and weeks of tending, but closure deflates into summary: "By morning's light...twenty tiny knowledge fruit sprouts" lists outcomes without a decisive image that reweights prior material or imposes felt cost. The "didn't consume the fruit herself" moment gestures toward sacrifice but is told, not shown, and the final paragraph drifts into thematic assertion ("already savoring the future flavors") rather than a charged image. No meaningful tightening occurs; the alignment concludes off-page and the protagonist executes a plan without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, tower, post-blackout) arrive promptly. The journey up the tower follows a causal chain: riddle → hidden panel → poem → copy → gift. However, the closure—handing the box to the girl and a streetlamp flickering on—lacks visible cost to Elias; he walks away "lighter," which undercuts the felt sacrifice required for RR (Charged Poise or Earned Stasis). The lamp's revival at that exact moment reads as coincidental reward rather than protagonist-driven consequence. The riddle mechanism is introduced late (at the apex) without prior setup, weakening the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural inferred from pattern-building (house breathing, objects migrating, orris root). Orientation anchors arrive late (~200 words before "Elias" names the POV, unclear whether Tuesday opening is the cottage or Elm Street). Closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing via the final image of houses "watchful" and "awake," but cost is asserted rather than legible—no choice, renunciation, or visible forfeiture reweights prior material on the page. The displacement ritual (teacup on roof, latch in garden, shard in attic) occurs without resistance or consequence that alters Elias's stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered revelations (algae, bronze flora, ampoule, chime), culminating in the chime-strike as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (underwater city garden, Kael, post-discovery) arrive early. The closure image—pure note ringing in the lifeless deep—reweights the "animate lifeless" premise and crystallizes his stance as bridge-builder. Cost is conceptual (vulnerability, engagement with the surface world) but legible in the final act. One meaningful deepening occurs when he perceives the divers as mourners rather than conquerors, altering his response.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, spiraling stairs, dice) arrive early. The causal chain—mapping, calculating, writing proofs, staircase crumbling—follows a because/therefore structure, but key mechanics (how proofs "rupture" infinity, why the chipped die splits at that moment) remain vague, weakening the closure's felt cost. The ending lands a Decisive Change (staircase gone, dice healed, Elias free), yet the transition from abstract equations to physical dissolution lacks the specificity that would make the cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara, rooftop greenhouse, waxing moon) and tracks a single accumulative arc toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: she completes the script, confirms that strangers remember, and achieves "quiet triumph." The closure lands on the page with felt emotional cost (the leaf will crumble, but the proof remains "etched within her"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens—density increase via sensory layering, symbol-making, and the final charged leaf image—holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream shifts from vision to "feeling" and she accesses the old man's memory. Minor deduction: the causal link between painting symbols and accessing memory is asserted more than dramatized, leaving the mechanism suggestive rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph; the grotto setting and displaced status are legible. The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: the bread-baking ritual gathers meaning through layered detail, and the final image (eating the "L" for the fresco) reweights the opening premise with conceptual cost—mourning art as kin. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara's private archival grief becomes communal communion. However, the closure reads more as thematic reconfiguration than a decisive change in options or knowledge; the cost is conceptual (acknowledging loss) rather than a visible trade-off that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the clockmaker's dissolution reweights his ambition as hubris. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The central weakness is that the yoyo solution and its consequences feel narrated rather than causally dramatized—he lifts it, it flares, he dissolves—without micro-choices or friction that would make the cost feel earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who the protagonist is, where exactly they are in the funhouse, and what immediate danger they face remains vague past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens wavers between Causal (the clasp as a tool, mirrors as paths) and Accumulative (mood and image density), never stabilizing until the final paragraph's sudden thematic assertion. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing ("fear transformed into art"), but the cost is told rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, loss, or decisive action demonstrates what the protagonist gives up or gains by "embracing" the dying reflection. The "paradoxical notes" method is mentioned but never used on the page to constrain or enable a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.6)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who the prophet is, why this matters now, and what's at stake remain abstract through most of the text. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the final image ("already composing") returns to the opening state without reweighting options or stakes. No visible cost forecloses a path; the prophet's stance at closure is identical to the start, creating stasis without earned pressure or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story anchors quickly (Tortuga, Elara, rusted gate, watchers) and follows a causal chain: observation → pattern discovery → hidden cache → communication test → ongoing connection. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts she cannot reunite with her father but establishes a fragile link, foreclosing physical passage with felt cost. The drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative coloring (pattern-building), held consistently. However, the crack discovery feels convenient—months of work compress into "then one afternoon" without prior setup that this shell could open—and the parchment solves multiple mysteries at once, reducing earned escalation. The ending image of playing into darkness has resonance, but the whistle's mechanics and the watchers' response lack sufficient on-page friction before success.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early (station, historian, letter). The piece follows a causal lens through the retrieval and confrontation, but the station master's appearance is unmotivated—no prior setup establishes his presence or surveillance. His instant surrender ("the master's shoulders slumped") after one rhetorical question breaks causality at the climax. The closure—Elias stepping into the night with the letter—offers a Decisive Change in possession but the cost is abstract ("truth would be hard") rather than felt on the page; no concrete price is paid or foreclosed path shown.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers reflections on absence, memory, and documentation toward a final image of preservation. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elias "wrest[s] history from oblivion's grasp"—but the cost remains abstract and declared rather than felt on the page. The opening anchors who/where/when adequately (surveyor, submerged pavilion, after drawbridge rises). However, the warning horn and drawbridge lowering function as externally imposed time limits rather than pressure arising from Elias's choices, weakening the cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain: blackout → candlelight examination → stamp discovery → hypothesis → coordinate revelation → reindexing. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the lens reads as primarily Causal with accumulative texture. The closure effect (reindexing the library's history) is on the page but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or altered relationship. The final image offers thematic resonance but lacks the felt price required for Charged Poise or a full Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (floating isle tea garden), and when (one year after Liora's death, working tonight) clearly within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through repeated polishing gestures and fragments of captured light, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the seventeenth crane joins "its silent, glowing kin" as Elias accepts the paradox that "They would ascend... even as he continued to descend." The cost is visible in his ongoing descent into "meticulous, heartrending work." The single meaningful deepening occurs as he transitions from general process to the specific crane holding Liora's laughter, intensifying the emotional texture. No causality breaks; the piece holds its lens cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Elias is and where he is remain unclear until deep into the piece, creating drift. The drive lens is ambiguous: Accumulative/Textural patterns (the geode, potential pools) compete with Causal gestures (initiating the hunt) but neither coheres at closure. The ending offers preparation and declaration ("prepared for the descent") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the cost is future-tense and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    The closure offers a conceptual repricing (the "instruction manual for belonging") but the cost is entirely abstract—no visible price paid, no foreclosed path, no tactical consequence. Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive clearly by paragraph one, so no deduction. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending asserts transformation ("Kai's journey had just begun again") without demonstrating a before/after shift in on-page options or stance. The pilgrim's cryptic setup and the barrier encounter promise escalation, yet the drone simply "moved with impossible grace through the barrier" without earned causality or visible cost to Kai.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors (who, where, when) arrive by paragraph two; the cobalt terrace at dusk is clear. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elias's invitation and Mara's acceptance crystallize a shift from isolation to shared burden, and her line about withheld truth being lighter when shared reweights the opening "weight of unspoken words" with felt cost. The accumulation of confession, watch hand exchange, and hand-in-hand departure coheres. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias admits he can't stop manufacturing memories—this narrows his options and charges the final gesture. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of his solitary ritual and the risk of exposing his shame to the one person most harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure unit—Julian "allowing himself to untether from the weight of that past failure"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is told rather than shown; no on-page action or dialogue demonstrates what he loses or forecloses by letting go. The exchange itself is summarized ("the exchange occurring without chains or paperwork") rather than dramatized, flattening the beat that should carry peak pressure. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered reflection and motifs), but the final image recycles prior abstractions without a decisive cadence shift or visible price, weakening closure legibility. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence in the ending where a felt or conceptual price is made undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (water pulls, utility poles as failed replacement, compass reweighted). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara reconciles with celestial navigation—but the cost is conceptual ("remembered that even broken navigators can find their way") rather than a decisive forfeiture on the page. The compass reversal (pointing toward herself, then east) feels metaphorical rather than causal, and the lighthouse arrival is narrated in summary ("hours later") without an on-page decisive act or visible price paid at that final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece sets up a journey-to-underground-lake frame but the causality is opaque: why this lake, how the newspaper led here, and what the time traveler's role is remain unexplained. The closure—Elias submerging and "letting go"—reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost is told ("he finally understood") rather than shown through a concrete action or image that reweights prior material. The Drive Lens appears Accumulative/Textural (bioluminescence, baseball, newspaper converging), but the final image does not crystallize options or meaning with undeniable pressure; it drifts into abstraction ("the light swallowed him whole"). The Orientation Test is satisfied early (cavern, lake, Elias), but midpoint linkage between newspaper directions and the pedestal scene is elided without dramatization, leaving a because/therefore gap.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and what "beast whisperer" means in practice remains vague past the 120-word mark, though the orchard and fortune anchor setting and motive. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: spice ritual → transformation → reunion, but the middle link (her actual metamorphosis) is summarized in perception-shift rather than dramatized choice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (bond reforged), yet the cost is asserted ("transformed yet unchanged") without a visible forfeiture on the page. The phoenix's rule-shift feels like a late convenience that solves the problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density (onyx ink, cracked saucer, hand-tracing) toward a final conceptual repricing: "lost time doesn't accumulate, it transforms into the beauty that chokes." However, closure cost remains abstract—the cartomancer's choice to "learn to breathe again" and "continue her readings" describes future intention rather than demonstrating an on-page forfeiture or stance shift with felt consequence. The portal-opening sequence provides a structural turn but the resolution tells us what she realizes without showing what she relinquishes or how her tactics change.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal frame: Elara searches → finds the tear → stitches → opens the portal, each step motivated. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she secures the opening and returns to the bridge, forgoing passage herself in favor of documentation)—however, the cost is told rather than felt on the page ("remembering her vow" arrives as convenient restraint, not a dramatized foreclosure). The final joy statement summarizes rather than images the reconfiguration, weakening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph and the setting is clear. The inciting incident—dropping the bottle—occurs on the page, but the chain that follows reads as coincidence serving Elias rather than agency narrowing options: the bug flies to the fissure, he follows passively, digs, and finds exactly what he sought without friction or trade-off. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (he has "grasped the fleeting, beautiful nature of change"), yet no visible cost is paid and no live option is foreclosed; the bug returns "as if summoned" and the collection is "complete" with no dramatized sacrifice. The final image asserts understanding without showing what was risked or lost to gain it.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal but linkage is weak: Elena decodes messages, follows a trail, and descends—each beat advances via convenient discovery rather than because/therefore pressure. Orientation anchors (Elena, luminous fort courtyard, twilight blackout) arrive early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the blackout reframed as transformation, not attack) but cost is absent—Elena nods and accepts the engineers' claim with no visible price, forfeited path, or embodied friction. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived; the Cost proof test fails (no sentence shows Elena paying a price at closure), triggering −0.6 in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through painted-rock ritual toward a revelation about negative spaces and invisible friction. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding achieved, promise kept), but cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture, trade-off, or foreclosed path appears on the page. The phrase "born anew" and transcription of equations replace a dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~150 words, violating the 120-word anchor test (−0.4). The "vigil in pause" ending with the timer's click offers a micro turn, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the poet's departure is asserted, not dramatized as a choice that forecloses a path. The accumulative lens is suggested but never coheres into a legible tightening or deepening at closure. Cost is claimed ("burden transformed into purpose") but not shown in a concrete sentence or image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (glass atrium, Elias, mechanical arm) appear early, satisfying the test. The story follows a single continuous scene with two characters, meeting default scope. However, the closure unit—"understanding" reached via Lyra's soft declaration—lacks visible or felt cost; the duel simply "ceases" without a legible before/after in options, stance, or consequence. The inferred lens is Situational (the duel as pressure vessel), but the ending relieves tension through consensus rather than crystallizing stance with undeniable cost. The needle card and sundial function as stage props without constraining tactics or changing knowledge in a way that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias and Maya meet, sort books, propose a garden, expand the network. The orientation anchors quickly (vagrant poet, rusted library, nighttime). However, the closure unit—Elias watching Maya teach teenagers and reflecting on his accumulated purpose—offers resonance but minimal decisive cost on the page. The encrypted contact network and relocated texts are told rather than shown altering tactics at the ending beat. The final image ("a banned flower was blooming") gestures toward Charged Poise but does not crystallize a visible trade-off or foreclose a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third without early anchoring (−0.4). The closure unit—clock repaired, pianist at peace—asserts a Resonant Reconfiguration but no visible cost appears on the page: what did he forfeit or foreclose to bend time? The mechanics (film reel, bioluminescence, tidal pull) are told rather than causally demonstrated, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation of gears turning. No meaningful tightening narrows options before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers dream imagery and symbolic pressure toward a reweighting at closure. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (the seed pulses with light, collective memory anchored), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—"had secured it" tells the outcome without showing what Elias sacrificed or what path he foreclosed. The "narrowly succeeded" line gestures at stakes without demonstrating their test on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the compass, lace pattern, and bonsai techniques layer to reweight Kenji's stance from drowning in remembrance to navigating it. Orientation anchors cleanly (islet, post-severance, bonsai work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the compass points toward "infinite possibility" rather than Aiko, and Kenji's verbal testing of apology paired with return to work crystallizes his acceptance. Cost is felt (he will not pursue Aiko) but remains oblique; the final image charges prior motifs without a sharper on-page forfeiture or decision that narrows tactics, keeping this shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara finds peace in her antithetical work, with cost legible in her aching knees and the emotional weight. The Accumulative drive lens holds, building through patterns and imagery. Orientation is clear early with the greenhouse setting, and the structure is a single coherent scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Kaelen's decision to create testimony art reweighting purpose with felt cost. The frost pattern method is taught early and pays off, maintaining coherence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality holds from inciting incident to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the scanner's cascade of colors reweights silence into music, cost legible in her tear and laugh. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (capsize survivor in winterglass conservatory). Pattern taught early and paid off; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Plot follows a tight causal chain under the Causal lens, from package arrival to diving expeditions to lens repair, with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the lens guides souls, but Marcus's own rest remains elusive, legible in "stillness that kept chasing him." Orientation is anchored early—undertaker, post-ceremony, basement—and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; all set-ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—bonds endure despite sanctions, emphasized by the bell's silent resonance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building trust through repeated food runs. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with the bell's chime triggering each beat. Persistent constraint (sanctions) shapes tactics throughout, culminating in Lena's takeover.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of luminous webs, reweighting the premise with cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from memory to healing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the maze dissolves and Elias is left alone, with felt cost in the emptiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the hyperbolic geometry shapes tactics persistently.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the vault opens amidst the wall's collapse, with felt cost (blood, dust, collapse) under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the chains and countdown shapes tactics. The closure unit is legible and reconfigures options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (forge glows gold, shipwrecks approve). Orientation is clear early, and the structure builds through sensory density without causality breaks, but the lens holds firmly only after midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the thief reinterprets his mission, foreclosing his initial path with felt cost (frustration turning to enlightenment). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building atmosphere to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early with thief, emerald station, and golden hour, and the jar of moonbeams persistently shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the teardrop piece symbolizes the thawing heart. Orientation is clear early, and the shift is motivated by ice imagery. Cost is legible in the embedding of the bookmark, altering the story's meaning. Persistent constraint of the bookmark shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the protagonist confronts his betrayer using vulnerability as a weapon, with felt cost in his newfound strength.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Julian untethers from his past, with cost legible in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by his past mistake shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the moon phase method reinforces causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost when Elara reconciles with the sea, reconfiguring her relationship to failure under a causal lens driven by her agency. The astronomical compass acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics from the outset. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Elias submerges and the light "swallows him whole," reconfiguring his understanding of empathy. The inferred Hybrid lens (accumulative textural with causal elements) holds, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The baseball and newspaper create coherent linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Orientation is clear within 120 words; causal drive holds with because/therefore linkages from the fortune to the conjuring. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Elara's transformation and the reforged bond. The phoenix rising acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing—realization that lost time transforms into "beauty that chokes the living." Cost is felt in the final image of carrying memory's weight. Orientation is clear early; pattern of imagery and ritual leads coherently to closure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara secures the portal but stays, costing personal passage; the Accumulative drive lens holds through thematic density. Orientation is clear early, and the tear's compassion guides causality without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Elias's accidental journey leads to tangible understanding. The drive lens holds, and cost is legible in the final image of the artifacts. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact despite coincidental elements.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Plot advances with causal linkages from discovery to decision, and closure lands with a decisive change in allegiance. Orientation is solid early on, but the cost of Elena's choice is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, limiting impact. The causal lens holds throughout, with no breaks in logic.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Plot follows a causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkages, from inciting incident to climax. Closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (risk of destabilization, becoming part of the geometry), and orientation is anchored early. The structure is tight, with no breaks in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with decisive change and cost under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens; orientation is early and clear, with the timer and envelope driving a legible shift from witness to cartographer.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Plot follows a causal drive with clear orientation early; the duel escalates through because/therefore linkages in dialogue and sundial use. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (understanding) with cost legible in the final brush of fingers and relaxed arm, underpinned by the persistent constraint of the sundial.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias's transformation carrying accumulated dreams, felt cost in the persistent threats.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece works on an accumulative/textural lens: we move from environmental ruin through her method to a final quiet stance, with a clear before/after in the charged final image. Causality is simple but consistent: dust patterns → slow decay/simplification → anticipated softening of grief. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) rather than a decisive turn, with modest but legible cost. The main limitation is that no central dilemma or event tightens into a meaningful structural “crunch,” so the arc feels more like an extended portrait than a shaped scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: fire attempt → clearing debris → discovery of ledger → frost patterns → journey to mineshaft → revelation → new artistic decision. The structure is a tidy single throughline with one temporal shift (night to dawn to day) and no orientation issues, and the closure—his choice to transform soot and sorrow into testimony—lands as a clear conceptual repricing with cost. Pressure is modest but coherent; the attack and syndicate threat remain largely off-page, so the sense of danger is more implied than dramatized. Still, for this length, the drive lens holds and the ending’s before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: single scene, clear goal, and a logical progression from setup (experiment) to payoff (thermal “music”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot recover hearing but forges a new language—yet the path there is smooth, with “she worked for hours” eliding struggle and cost, softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: package → obsession with the lens → research into Mirrormere → dangerous dives → underwater ritual → functioning lighthouse for the dead. The structure handles a big temporal span through compact summary (“Six weeks and three life-threatening diving expeditions later…”) without losing orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus succeeds in sending others “home” while remaining restlessly in-between, a before/after that’s legible and costly. The main structural limitation is that the high-risk expeditions are told rather than partly dramatized, slightly softening the sense of tightening constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear: sanctions → hollowed community → Elias’s bell plan → nightly deliveries → observed changes → generational bond reconfiguration, all under one coherent lens. The structure is essentially a summarized montage rather than discrete, dramatized beats, but it still accumulates toward a closure where leadership and belonging are redefined. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell’s mission “fulfilled,” Lena now running the operations, and the community’s sense of pride reweighted by anonymity. The main limitation is that key turning points (pushback, risk, concrete near-failures) are told at a distance, so costs and options never feel sharply narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear progression from setup (arriving at the viaduct with camera and tear) through experiment to a reconfigured ending stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: breathing and applying the tear → visible sparks → healing effect → new self-understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive choice, but the before/after is legible. The main weakness is the very soft sense of constraint or price; nothing meaningfully resists his aim.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: trapped by the halo fragment → decision to reach the maze’s center → resistance from the garden → disintegration of the fragment and collapse of the maze. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in his relationship to the past. However, much of the maze’s opposition is described in broad strokes (“he ran,” “the garden resisted”) rather than through specific, escalating tactical choices, which slightly flattens the structure. Still, the overall arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: imprisoned liberator → deciphered code in piano bench → misplayed sequence → recalibration via arrow pattern → vault opens as wall collapses. The ticking “wall coming down” clock and the chains as constraint create coherent situational pressure that escalates toward a decisive change (seeds saved, Kael likely dying). The small reversal—misjudging the last note and then correcting using the arrow’s fletching—is well-motivated and pays off prior setup. Some compression of time and puzzle complexity strains plausibility slightly, but not enough to disrupt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, lyric structure coheres: we move from workshop/forge context to the greenhouse ritual and end with a clear closure unit (he successfully captures and imprints the sound, then leaves with it). Orientation is strong early—who he is, where he is, and what he’s doing are all legible, and the aurora/forge/greenhouse pattern holds. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, with pressure building through atmosphere and memory rather than discrete plot turns. The cost at closure—carrying and distributing the sound of trust breaking—is conceptually present but understated, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear objective, an attempted magical act, a setback (silence), and a reinterpreted outcome. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: his preparation → moonbeam use → void → re-reading the flowers → internal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his entire practice, with the choice to leave the portrait untouched functioning as an earned stasis/renunciation. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, which slightly softens the impact at this elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline is clear: he arrives to work, begins one project, then reorients toward a more resonant piece as the external thaw reframes his intentions. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a solid closure beat when he embeds the bookmark and sets the piece aside to cool. The cost is modest but legible (abandoning the original plan in favor of a riskier, truer object), fitting an accumulative/lyric drive. No major orientation or lens issues appear, though the stakes remain internally scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clear: enter library → decode cast → confront betrayer → return changed, which gives a solid spine under a Causal lens with a Decisive Change/RR at the end. The piece compresses its most pivotal beat—the confrontation—into summary (“struck—not with violence, but with the seashell’s whispers turned into a confession”), undercutting drama and cost. The structure (library / lab / return to library) is legible and maps neatly onto the internal arc but feels schematic. Closure is present, but the key reversal feels narratively easy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: watching stars die → mapping silence → discovering a center → realizing the night is a gateway, all building toward the final extinguishing of the last star. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—night redefined from void to inhabited gateway—at the exact moment of total darkness. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each new understanding plausibly emerges from his ongoing method. The main limitation is that the “presence” awakening and the map-as-key are stated rather than tested, so structural turns remain more intellectual than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: abandoned institute → anomalous violin appears → 734 chooses to play → overlapping loops manifest → intensified playing fuses timelines → 734 transforms. Backstory about the Chronos Institute and Thorne is anchored to present stimuli (the courtyard, the violin) and directly informs stakes and options. Closure is decisive and legible with cost (violin destroyed, loops ended, role redefined), under a primarily causal drive lens with accumulative texture. Structure is straightforward and coherent, if slightly reliant on exposition rather than fully dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: registrar observes → “eavesdrops” via symbols → interprets an attempt at trust → steps out, speaks, invites them in. Structure is a single, continuous scene with clear spatial anchors and a coherent accumulative drive toward tentative connection. Closure is a conceptual repricing (quiet redefined as full, not empty) with a faint but present cost in his choice to violate the new social norm of wordlessness. Stakes and turns stay small, so the before/after is more thoughtful than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: present-tense polishing → recollection of the researcher → anomalous garden behavior → revelation at the maze’s center. Causality works under a mostly accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with the polishing ritual triggering the supernatural escalation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—gardens literally and metaphorically “knowing” him—but the cost is more implied than felt, and the stakes remain largely internal. Some backstory exposition about luck measurement slows momentum but does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single scene escalating through the sequence of levers, with clear orientation in setting, time, and POV. Causality is straightforward—each lever heightens the experiment, leading to the realization that time branches and the decision to transmit proof. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing (time as branching sideways realities), but the cost is mostly intellectual rather than dramatized. The drive reads as Causal with a quiet conceptual ending, but pressure and consequence remain modest for the thematic ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causality is clean: flood → discovery of program → recognition of cipher → decoding → performance → ghostly acknowledgment. The scene holds together in one continuous window and lands a clear closure beat with the apparition and the receding water. However, the resolution feels overly convenient—no serious obstacle impedes the decoding or performance, and the cost of success is more implied than dramatized. The structure is solid but lacks a meaningful complication or price point that would sharpen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: wake from fever → engage with illustration → smudge → visions clarify → brother’s true fate reframed → final reconfiguration with the illustration and sextant. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural: each sensory and symbolic move layers toward a conceptual repricing of “truth” and “weight.” Closure lands in the realization that the truth is an absence and in her taking on the burden of naming it, with a clear before/after. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the causal thread from fever-visions to concrete action to reframed understanding is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: confession → compulsion to explore → discovery of the wheel → psychic tape interpretation → decision to turn the valve → emotional release, all in a single, legible scene. Closure is a decisive change—his burden lifts—and the before/after is unmistakable, though the cost is mostly implied as the prior years of strain rather than something sacrificed in the moment. The coincidence/mysticism of the taped message matching the environment is accepted genre-wise but isn’t grounded in any rule beyond “this is how his ritual works,” which keeps the structure from feeling fully inevitable. Still, orientation and drive remain coherent under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: catacomb → origami transit → obsidian refuge → return, with a clear two-shard structure and a quiet conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is loose but coherent—weariness prompts retreat; retreat yields renewed understanding; that understanding informs the decision to continue chronicling. Closure is present but soft: the final choice to record another entry and accept their own nature as part of impermanence carries only a faint sense of cost. Structurally sound and legible, but the arc feels more like a lyrical loop than a strongly reweighted before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Maya prepares, music tracks the eclipse’s phases, Leo’s rhythmic response leads to his approach and question, followed by the locket exchange, then an epilogue confirming change. The dominant drive lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative/lyric overlay, and the ending qualifies as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo speaking/engaging, Maya reconceiving her role). The time-box of the eclipse gives mild structural pressure and the “weeks later” shard lands without feeling like a bolt-on summary. What’s missing for a higher score is any real risk of failure or complication; the breakthrough unfolds with minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-moment choice to probe → investigation via device → discovery of the weaver’s account → reinterpretation of the displaced axis and dragons → charged final image. Causality holds, with the diaries and tapestry coherently feeding Aria’s new understanding, and the narrative adheres to a single scene window with interleaved archival shards. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the axis reframed as metaphysical and the final “stirring” in the walls, with a conceptual cost around what humanity has lost. The risk and potential damage to the diaries are mentioned but not meaningfully tested on the page, so the sense of price at the climax is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is legible: Elias rewrites the microdot, sends signals, and arranges the courier’s path so the network collapses quietly. Structurally it’s a single continuous night with a clear beginning and end, and orientation is solid. But there is no real turn or complication—everything described is already decided and unfolds without friction. Closure lands more as a reported outcome than a dramatized change with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece holds a coherent single-scene arc: arrive before possession completes, apply method, strain, then fragile victory as the anchor stabilizes. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens—each chant, loop, and painted mark incrementally alters the entity’s stance and the anchor’s state. Closure is on-page and clear, with a before/after: unstable anchor and rising threat to stabilized anchor and temporary reprieve. The main limitation is that the middle beats feel somewhat repetitive in tactic, so the structural progression is more in intensity than in clearly differentiated turns.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ascent + mapping ritual → gathering resonance → dawn chord → crash and descent. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each new mapped memory builds toward the climax, and the nautilus/glass/horizon motifs all return in altered form at the end. Closure is solid: he succeeds at his singular goal, pays with exhaustion, and the world reverts while his internal stance is subtly reconfigured. Stakes and the nature of the “success” remain intentionally small-scale and interior, which is aesthetically valid but keeps the structural impact modest rather than seismic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is legible: Kael navigates a rule-governed, procedurally generated viaduct to escape a looping labyrinth, finally breaking through at the cost of his quasi-immortality and power. World mechanics (“each step forward spawned a new reality”) are sketched rather than deeply grounded, but they’re stable enough to support the beats. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: labyrinth broken, timelines merged, tablet shattered, him merely mortal on a street. Some mid-story looping (“retraced his steps again”) feels more told than dramatically differentiated, but it doesn’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival with a goal, problem (broken needle), risky solution (reforging it), experiment (backward records), then a culminating internal shift. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step intensifying the sensory and emotional stakes toward the cracking of her numbness. Closure is on-page and convincing—she hasn’t “fixed” herself, but her state is reconfigured with a visible before/after. The piece stays within a single, coherent scene, keeping the drive focused.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: being followed → retreat to courtyard → discovery of tube → study/lamp/journal frame → message → contemplation → decision. Structure is linear, with one setting shift, and closure is a Charged Poise: he decides to enter the storm/rogue sphere despite prior caution. The cost and concrete implications of that decision are more implied than sharply rendered, so the before/after line is conceptually clear but not maximally felt. Orientation is solid; no lens or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: his longstanding grief → targeted experiment → lunar-timed bloom → UV revelation → captured shadow scent → conceptual shift at the end. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the piece sustains a single, coherent scene with a clear goal and payoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he ends with a new understanding of his sorrow embodied in the vial, and the cost (facing the father-memory) is legible. The main limitation is lack of complicating turns or tactical adjustments—the experiment works on first pass, keeping structure solid but not maximally dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: orientation lands early, the grotto exploration proceeds in clear layers, and the discovery of the twin devices provides a legible climax. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “choice” rather than a conventional decision. While the third-path solution (braiding the rope between devices) is thematically apt, it partially undercuts the previously framed dilemma; the sense of before/after cost at closure is somewhat softened. Still, the story achieves a coherent closure unit where Langdon’s understanding of time and choice is reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV scene with brief, well-anchored backstory that all tilts the present action toward the final realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each musical and narrative gesture (humming, playing, listening, then speaking) deepens the central premise of unbinding the hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush becomes canvas, Lyra becomes the next note, and the world shifts from ruin to nascent renewal (the sapling unfurling). Cost is mostly emotional and conceptual rather than dramatized through foreclosed alternatives, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival in the grotto, engagement with the petal, discovery of unexpected resilience, and a choice that redefines the dealer’s practice. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens: repeated sensing and handling of the petal lead to a conceptual repricing of their work. Closure lands on-page with cost—the dealer foregoes the usual extraction for a less commodifiable, more vulnerable stance. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative structure: misdelivered locket → friendship → introduction to maestro → encounter with composer → final grandmother connection, all under a “cycles of compassion” drive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the realization that these small acts of kindness loop back through generations—but the cost is mostly abstract, with very little concrete narrowing of options. The transitions between symphony hall, memory of the locket, and library are clear and temporally anchored. The chain leans heavily on coincidence yet doesn’t quite interrogate or complicate that reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: myth of the arbor → search for the tag → incomplete discovery → despair → decision to create/dedicate their own completion, leading to the bloom. Closure lands as a decisive change in situation (the arbor activates, community rekindles) and stance (Kael’s ache reconfigured into belonging). Stakes and sequence are easy to follow, with no orientation problems. The absence of a sharper complicating turn or constraint keeps the structure effective but not striking.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece tracks cleanly as a causal, single-POV drive: Elias senses heightened pull in the canals → borrows time to reach the Whispering Knot → confronts and frees the source, breaking the loop. Orientation (who/where/when) is quick and solid despite the density of worldbuilding, and the structural focus on one mission-night keeps it tight. Closure lands with a decisive change (the cadence restored, echoes uncaged, loop broken) but the on-page articulation of aftermath and world-cost is brief and somewhat abstract. The result is structurally sound but shy of fully maximal impact for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from nightly preparation to ritual activation to a realizational closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each pass over the setting (drips, fruit, mosaic, eyes) adds meaning until the central vision reconfigures his relationship to loss. Causality is modest but coherent—ritual → activation of eyes → vision → emotional repricing—and the cost (relinquishing the fantasy of a solvable mystery) is legible at the end. Stakes stay intimate and never fracture, though escalation is more contemplative deepening than sharply tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: discovery of the tape (off-page), present mission to cache it, and the payoff in the librarian’s discovery, all under the outage/dawn frame. Causality is clear—his prior explorations enable the current act, which yields the ending image—and the single scene with embedded memory is well contained. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration: his pattern of invisibly curating connections is affirmed when she reacts to the tape. The main limitation is that the structural arc never tightens into a true dilemma or risky turn; the “window of opportunity” reads more as schedule than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: weeks of observation → first major storm and failed intervention → second storm and surrender, culminating in a clear internal reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under a textural lens (repeated storms and failed modeling pressure him toward a new stance). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his entire project; the before/after is legible and anchored in specific acts. The arc is modest in scale but fully contained and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time walk → recalled apothecary gift → arrival at convergence → exchange → shared visions → reframed purpose. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: the brooch, rain trails, and convergence are seeded early and pay off directly in the vortex and vision sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s stance on insomnia and her role in the lineage shifts with a felt conceptual cost (choosing wakefulness as vocation rather than curse). The only limitation is that external stakes and concrete obstacles remain low, so the peak turn is more contemplative than structurally gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is clean: entrance → exploration → discovery of the pearl → inhabitation/awakening → pilgrim’s arrival and mutual recognition. Causality is legible (touching the pearl plus shadow convergence leads to transformation), and the ending offers a conceptual repricing of what clairvoyance means. The main weakness is that the arc unfolds without genuine complication—no failed attempt, setback, or hard choice precedes the breakthrough. Closure lands, but with low felt price and relatively gentle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—from decree lifting to exhibit, with the valve as a hinge—is clean and legible, and the time jumps are handled smoothly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s relationship to absence is reweighted through the exhibit. That said, a lot of the story is summarized rather than dramatized, and the main turns feel more like gentle progressions than pressured shifts, which limits impact under this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: arrows → phantom platform → fortress gate → hall of mirrors → repriced journey, with each step legibly emerging from the last. Causality is simple but intact, and the closure (realizing the fortress is not the destination and choosing to walk away) is on the page with a clear before/after in stance. The cost—passing through shattering mirrors of buried selves—is conceptually strong, though it’s not anchored in any specific prior behavior or relationship, which blunts its force. Orientation in time/space and stakes is clear throughout and supports the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara climbs, engages the tile, experiences memories, then descends changed, with the transcribed “essence” as a bridge to the village. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure beat in her relinquishing skepticism and carrying the story outward. The main weakness is the overlong, summarizing denouement (the repeated extra lines after “As she descended the stairs…”), which blunts the impact of the core turning point. Cost is present but soft, mostly implied emotional weight rather than a strongly dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: long preparation → storm’s peak → chamber of frayed geometry → insertion of the fragment → spatial collapse and unmaking. Orientation is solid very early (who/where/what trap) and the closure beat—his chosen dissolution and the residual scar—lands decisively with legible cost. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone, and the final conceptual repricing (freedom as unmaking rather than exit) is on the page. The only structural weakness is a slight over-explanation in the closing third that restates what the images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: hiding → plan using security loop and ink → guard’s approach → escape → handoff of both person and object. The Drive Lens is clearly causal, and the closure beat (Elena’s escape and Maya relinquishing the ink) is on-page with a modest cost. The main weakness is how smoothly everything goes—no complications or reversals once the plan starts, which dulls the climax’s bite. Still, for the scope, the structure is coherent and satisfying with a credible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and clean: dawn ritual → extraction of temporal textures → crafting → reflective summation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern is coherent, but there’s only a gentle deepening rather than a real turn; the ending is more a restatement of the premise with a mild conceptual repricing of the town’s silence. Closure is present but soft, with little sense of altered options or new constraints, so this reads as a polished vignette rather than a fully pressurized story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: we start with the port and erasure, intensify around the discovery of the poison label, and close on him adopting it as “key” and proof. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he crystallizes his identity as a cartographer of the forgotten, accepting namelessness in exchange for this composite self. Causality is simple but coherent; each step follows plausibly from the last. The stakes remain abstract and never quite pinch hard enough to feel decisive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: set-up in the observatory, the experimental attempt with the cello, the shell’s new behavior, and a conceptual turn at the end. Causality is soft but coherent—playing and humming trigger memory-resonance, which reframes past events and enables the final conceptual shift. Closure arrives as a clear conceptual repricing (universe in consciousness), paired with a behavioral change (writing with “joy of a new beginning”), though the price is mostly implicit. The accumulative, reflective drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly legible: privatization looms, Mara devises a graffiti-based reorganization strategy, the barges arrive, and negotiations begin under the influence of her network. Causality holds at a macro level, but almost all turns (network spread, community coordination, even the arrival of barges) are conveyed in retrospective summary rather than in-scene beats under pressure. Closure is a solid resonant reconfiguration—Mara’s world moves from defensive scrambling to a charged, cautiously hopeful poise—but the cost is more implied than dramatized. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure plus accumulative patterning), with closure more conceptual than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: ascent → setup → rare light event → activation of the new chemical process → successful photograph → reflective exit. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: he achieves his goal, but the victory is tinged by the recognition that an era of exploration is ending and commercialization will consume this place. However, the summit’s “off-limits” radiation risk and the difficulty of the climb never meaningfully complicate the on-page attempt; everything goes according to plan once he’s in position. The structure is solid and legible, but the lack of a concrete turn or complication in the present action flattens the arc somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and clean: broken drone → diagnostic via touch/water → incremental fixes → successful test flight before the ship’s departure. This reads as an accumulative, single-scene repair vignette with a modest ticking clock from the ship’s horn. Closure lands (the hummingbird reborn and departing into the mist) but the cost of failure or difficulty along the way is barely articulated, so the before/after is conceptually more than dramatically felt. Structure is coherent but low-pressure, edging toward competence-porn montage.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: falcon/phrasebook → observation of condensation → cross-referencing → realization about “where the rivers begin” → decision to embark. Structure is linear and coherent, and the story lands on a charged poise: the eve of departure, coordinates captured before they vanish. Closure does carry a conceptual shift (reframing river origins as singular convergence points), but the cost is mostly implied and low-friction. The drive lens reads as mainly accumulative/textural with enough causal scaffolding to hold, but escalation is modest for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative structure—arrival, archway activation, spreading resonance, clock tower alignment, completed revival—is coherent and easy to follow. Causality is largely magical but internally consistent: sound → sigils glow → cobblestones hum → ghosts stir → town revives. Closure is a clean Decisive Change (ghost town dies / new town born), but cost is conceptual rather than felt; nothing meaningful is sacrificed or risked on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, yet the lack of resistance or alternative outcomes keeps the structure from feeling truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: signal → approach → descent → encounter with core → temporal unsnarling → integration, with a clear before/after in Marina becoming the new signal sender. Closure is solid (both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing as the “distress” signal becomes an invitation), and cost is legible in her surrender of individual existence. However, several turns (oxygen crisis, gravitational anomalies, water breach) are invoked and then largely bypassed via summary rather than dramatized as active obstacles, softening structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias deciphers the scuffs, uses the lattice, walks through the impossible wall, escapes, and the final paragraph shows the consequences of his earlier, disbelieved warnings. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and remains stable, and the impossible passage is taught and then used without last-minute rule changes. Closure lands with a decisive change—Elias is free and vindicated in absentia—and a conceptual repricing of his family “curse.” The main weakness is the distance of the climactic payoff (the authorities’ discovery) which is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a series of escalating manifestations culminates in contact, memory ignition, and her dissolution, with the bead anchoring the arc. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens—the bead brightens, his awareness deepens, their encounter peaks, and the debt is paid. Closure is strong: her fading and the bead’s transfer to his hand mark a clear before/after with emotional cost. The only limitation is a slight sense of inevitability without much tactical variation or surprise in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: vanished tides → sleepwalking to canyon → discovery of ruined looms → decision to sew → transformed labyrinth and reinterpreted tides. Causality holds under a Hybrid (primarily accumulative/textural) lens, and the closure offers a clear before/after repricing of the empty tide pools as invitation. The main limitation is that no beat feels truly pressured or jeopardized; each development arrives smoothly rather than as a constrained turn. Still, the arc is coherent and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: descent → locating the tomb → excavation → fitting the sundial → subtle reconfiguration of her life’s trajectory, with clear causal links throughout. Orientation is strong from the opening (“catacomb orchard,” diaspora returnee, purpose of the journey), and the drive lens reads as a Hybrid of causal and accumulative. Closure lands on the on-page act of placing the base and the light that follows, reconfiguring her understanding of her wandering with a recognizable before/after. The cost—accepting that her path will now be bound to this place and work—is conceptual rather than dramatic, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is essentially a single, continuous ritual morning with no significant turn: he prepares, writes codes, catalogs them, reflects, and finishes. Causality is clear but very gentle, with an accumulative rather than driven feel, and there is no meaningful reversal, only repetition of the same idea in different phrasings. Closure exists as a mild resonance—he completes the mandala and feels his usual satisfaction—but the before/after distinction is weak and low-cost. The lack of a sharper shift in options or understanding keeps this below strong-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is largely static and accumulative: Elias embroiders, the candle flickers, conspiracies “unravel,” and then the chart is complete. There is closure—an RR/Charged Poise when he makes the final stitch and the coup is “postponed by a thread”—but the causal chain from stitching to averting the coup is abstract and unearned on the page. No concrete obstacle interrupts or redirects his tactics; progression is mostly told as inevitability. Orientation is clear and the lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, but the decisive change feels more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive in the labyrinth, initiate the ritual, deepen through more confessions, then reach moonlit closure and release. Causality within the magical logic is coherent (shard → leaf → condensation words → move to moonlight for full healing) and there’s a legible before/after as the apology moves from trapped to released. The ending offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth shifts from prison of possibilities to harmony of release, and the shard’s purpose concludes. Stakes remain narrowly focused and internal, but there are no real causality or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clean single scene with a causal spine: anesthetic → encounter → deciphering → realization → departure. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but there is a clear closure unit when the notes resolve into a “map” and his stance toward his wounds shifts. The disappearance of the girl is slightly enigmatic yet still legible as a lyric ellipsis rather than a plot hole. Cost is on the page via the return of physical pain and acceptance of ongoing work, giving the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous ritual in a defined place, building to the resurrection scene and then its dissipation. Causality is coherent and accumulative—her choice to engage the fragment leads to the orchard’s temporary return, then to her drained but satisfied state. Closure lands as an on-page resonant reconfiguration: she cannot keep the joy, but she can reliably touch and reframe it. Stakes stay modest and internal, but within that frame the arc is fully legible and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: chapel → nickel activation → sound garden/three awakenings → return with reconfigured stance, all under a coherent Hybrid (causal + accumulative) lens. Causality is solid—nickel warms, portal opens, experience reweights her relation to art—and the single portal transition is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when she resumes work with altered perception, though the cost of that shift is more implied than dramatized. There are no major orientation or lens-clarity issues, but the arc remains relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: clandestine meeting → garden-planting operation → state response (raids) → residual survival of the code. The weeks-later shift is legible, and the final wildflower offers a resonant reconfiguration, though the regime’s counter-pressure and the practical consequences to the club remain somewhat soft-focus and underdramatized for the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: postcard and shell are established, the centuries compress, then the glowing postcard and lullaby catalyze the encounter with the blossom and the armistice realization. Causality is soft but legible—postcard glows, wind carries lullabies, poet chooses to follow and touch the blossom, which triggers the transformation. Closure is strong: his insomnia quiets, the blossom departs, and the new postcard reframes his role (“The next chapter is yours”), giving a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the armistice mechanism arrives with a touch of fated convenience rather than pressure the story has to struggle through.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: cracked chime endangers the library’s balance, repair via song proves the method and cost structure, then the higher-cost locket choice lands the closure. The structure is essentially linear with accumulative texture—no head-hopping or orientation issues, and the museum’s stirrings after the song extend pressure rather than digress. Closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the caretaker accepts ongoing sacrifice with heightened awareness of its toll. The main limitation is that the conflict evolves more in texture than in options, so the middle doesn’t significantly reconfigure what “tomorrow” can be.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: promises → growing magical response → his entrance and reconnection, with a clear before/after in their relationship. Causality is simple but coherent; each promise escalates the ritual and leads to the ink well’s shattering and his appearance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is soft—his arrival feels convenient and the risk of failure is never concretely tested. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not gripping at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: he comes to the amphitheater with a goal, analyzes the adhesive, decodes the message, interprets the chain, and emerges with a changed plan for the floodgate. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation debt. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines both the floodgate and his role from simple utility to ethical balance, but the price is primarily conceptual and future-facing rather than felt in-scene. The lack of a concrete external ticking clock or counterforce keeps the arc more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure—one continuous attic scene braided with backstory—coheres cleanly, with the decision to attach and release the meteorite-bearing pigeon as the central turn. Causality is intact: hospital-room vow → meteorite-as-vessel → dust-mapping method → selection of storm-cloud bird → risky release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward trust and self-authorship shifts in the final paragraphs with a legible emotional cost (risking his last link to his sister). Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic rather than situationally pressured, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    The piece functions under an accumulative/textural drive: Elea studies, reflects, perceives patterns, and arrives at a conceptual reconfiguration about thresholds and distance. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when after the butterfly effect), and the single-scene structure is coherent. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes thresholds as sacred separations she must guard, marking a clear before/after in understanding. The cost of this stance, though implied in her solitude, is only lightly sketched, keeping the structural payoff more intellectual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: feather discovery → archival digging → mechanism activation → observatory transformation → bioluminescent revelation → conceptual shift about belonging. The piece reads as Hybrid but leans accumulative/textural by the end, with the closure operating as a Conceptual Repricing of what “belonging” means. However, stakes are low-pressure and external obstacles are nearly absent, so the final shift feels relatively cost-light even though the before/after is legible. Structure is otherwise sound and temporally anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single continuous scene with a causal chain: birds arrive → seeds fall → anomaly appears → pattern recognition → conceptual revelation. The global drive feels Causal with an accumulative texture overlay, and the closure is a conceptual repricing—realizing that memory erasures are deliberate harvests—with some implied cost. Time pressure (“before memory faded”) and the birds’ departure give a mild but legible frame. The main weakness is that the revelation lands intellectually more than dramatically, so the cost at closure is felt only lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain (bishop placement → encounter with woman → note → clock reset at midnight → crowd reaction) is clean and legible, with a coherent Hybrid/Causal-Textural drive. Closure exists—the clock’s shift from 11:59 to midnight and the completed “serendipity” mark a before/after—but the price of success is minimal, so the decisive change lacks heft. Structurally, it’s a single smooth scene without orientation issues or rule-breaking coincidences. The ending’s “next game” gesture offers a cadence rather than a deep reconfiguration of options.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: present-moment ritual framed by concise backstory, culminating in her successful fledge and release from the garden’s binding. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: exile → study of gaps → planned ritual → dance → dissolution of the moonstone → inscription → loosening of the anchor. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the verse that transcends the Ban’s logic—and the before/after is legible. The main limitation is that no beat seriously threatens failure or complicates the process; escalation is smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is a single continuous scene with a stable POV and a clear accumulative/textural drive: stone → rings → successive “messages” → reaffirmed purpose. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration in which his practice is reweighted rather than transformed. However, the stakes of his “noctilucent reckonings” never tighten beyond a soft deadline (“before everything shifts”), so the final cadence feels more like a pleasant return than a necessary turn. Minor repetition of beats (reiterating his purpose and the bay’s secrets) makes the middle feel slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night-walk frame, anchored by opening the box and reflecting, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the bell and his trauma. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each reflection layering toward the final realization. Closure is clear—he leaves with a different understanding and a reconfigured inner map—though the turn is more gently declarative than sharply dramatized. No orientation issues, but escalation is more steady than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we remain in one scene as ritual actions, the gauge’s responses, and the rising tide build to a conceptual shift. Causality is coherent—her adjustments to the patterns trigger changes in the gauge, culminating in the unreadable symbol and her decision to share her work. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive act; the “before” (private experimenter) vs. “after” (committed to sharing hope) is legible but the cost is more implied than felt. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: diaries → search of manor → discovery of negatives → wall-contact → vision → reframed sense of legacy. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a brief, well-anchored flashback; orientation is solid and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative with causal turns. Closure lands via conceptual repricing of “legacy’s burden” into “direction,” though the cost remains mostly conceptual and lightly felt. One could wish for a slightly sharper on-page consequence or dilemma at the end to deepen that before/after divide.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure (one ritual morning framed by bells) is clean, with a clear temporal window and a legible before/after once the mirage dissolves. Causality is modest but coherent: rain → prism light → painting window → bells as hard stop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the girl briefly sees her alternate selves, proving the painter’s work matters. However, the global drive feels more like atmosphere than a tightening plot, so the final cadence, while satisfying, is quiet rather than strikingly consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and an accumulative drive as he reads the names and moves toward sunset alignment. Causality is simple but coherent—he chose this terrace, time, and act to confront his failures, and finishing the list plus setting down the clipboard marks a resonant reconfiguration. The cost is legible in his struggle to keep reading and in the emotional weight lifted/reframed at the end. The arc is more meditative than sharply turned, but within an accumulative lens the closure lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → approach → ritualized technological act → loss/transformation → rain and departure, all in one tight scene. Causality is coherent (his past drought enables the present setting and tech; initiating the device triggers the egg’s transformation and atmospheric mirroring), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the egg’s status and his relationship to extinction change. Stakes are largely conceptual and emotional rather than situational, but they’re legible and scaled appropriately to the length. A slightly heavier on-page sense of risk or potential failure in the release would have deepened structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the sanctuary, progressive untangling of threads, culminating in the red thread and exit transformed. Causality is internally consistent within the mythic frame—each untangled thread clarifies desire and moves her toward liberation. The closure is clear but the cost is more stated than deeply felt, and the external stakes remain minimal, keeping it short of top-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: argument → epiphany → experimental puppet shows → public/critical reaction → culminating performance in the dome and repriced relationship to the story stick. The structure reads as a controlled mosaic of scenes, each deepening the core project rather than fragmenting it. Closure lands via a clear conceptual reconfiguration—releasing control of the puppets and demoting the stick to “just wood.” The cost of that closure (what he relinquishes) remains more implied than viscerally dramatized, which keeps the piece just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is essentially a single continuous scene with a brief return to “solid ground,” operating under an accumulative/textural lens where each monarch death and knot tightens the piece’s pattern. Causality is simple but coherent: Elias comes to build a signal in time for the last migration; butterflies die; he incorporates them; then he leaves, accepting the work’s impending erasure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his decision not to look back and to accept the structure’s destruction crystallizes the piece’s premise about fleeting proof. The weakness is that the narrative drive feels more like extended mood than a sharpened arc, so the before/after shift, while present, is subtle rather than forcefully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual sequence in the sanctum, with a clear before/after—he activates the rope, the names manifest, and his relationship to his guilt reconfigures. Causality is legible (card → reconfiguring braids → light and voices → internal revaluation), and the closure is on-page and earned as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but each step in the process coheres logically. The main limitation is that no strong complication or structural surprise emerges once the ritual is underway; the path feels somewhat foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: decaying directive → investigation of the wafer seal → recognition that material repair is futile → choice to enter the AI dreamscape → restoration and self-acceptance. Closure is solidly on the page—both the AI’s hum and the wafer seal’s state reconfigure, giving a decisive before/after. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with a conceptual accent, and that lens holds through the end. The main limitation is that obstacles inside the dreamscape feel low-resistance, so the climax resolves quickly and smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine (decoding → waiting for alignment → performing the ritual → sealing the covenant) is coherent, and closure lands when he presses his palm to the tile and internalizes the devotion. The piece reads primarily as accumulative/textural: pressure is more atmospheric than event-driven. The cost—risk of inspectors, leaving the tile behind, subsuming himself into the covenant—is mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized, which limits impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure—visitor after visitor receiving the same intervention—reads clearly and builds towards Elias’s closing realization. Causality is simple but intact: people arrive with resentment, accept the box, experience release, and depart, while the box’s reappearance patterns the beats. Closure rests on a conceptual repricing (brokenness as healing, Elias’s own subtle change) and is legible, though low-cost. The repetition verges on mechanical, with minimal variation in how each “case” complicates or deepens the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene ritual structure: study of the sextant → initiation of the breathing ritual → manifestation of the dream-bird → its settling into the sextant/mirror home. Causality is intact under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the district’s boundaries stay subtly altered. The cost is largely conceptual (reality slightly unmoored) rather than dramatized, so the before/after is more atmospheric than pressured. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the drive lens remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal thread (breach → refuge in orchard → decision to plant memory-objects → quiet, charged departure). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: after planting the seed and relics, she leaves with a new, if fragile, certainty about enduring vows, and the final image of the ribbon and imagined laughter crystallizes this. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural—each symbolic act layers pressure and meaning rather than producing sharp reversals—and that pattern is consistent. The only limitation is that the breach and contract world remain abstract enough that some stakes feel conceptual rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative structure—office → restricted wing/orchard → home/orchard → weeks of visits → final note—holds cleanly, and closure lands with Margaret choosing to become part of the inheritance chain. Causality is broadly coherent (her curiosity leads to use of the cameo; repeated use leads to understanding, which leads to selecting a successor), but many critical beats are summarized (“Weeks blurred…”) rather than dramatized. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event, which suits the piece but keeps stakes conceptual. Some repetition of realization beats (“she realized…”) dulls structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diary → entry into Stack → realization about gaps → reinterpretation of the diary as originating text → formal renegotiation → access to the hidden library → breaking Kael’s trance. The structure is linear and coherent, with one central reframe (the diary’s nature) that credibly narrows options and changes tactics. Closure is solid: the rescue succeeds, but the conceptual cost—Kael’s “sorrowful, terrible understanding” and the “quiet hum of potential” marked on their hearts—renders a clear before/after. The stakes and price could be made sharper with one more concrete failure or near-loss before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: card → ticket booth → narrative threads → engine room convergence → recapturing final thread → ship dissolves → garden. Closure lands with a decisive change (ship freed, twin integrated) and the sequence of locations feels logically ordered. The main weakness is that reversals and costs within that structure are soft—the fog’s resistance and the crew’s loops are observed more than they are active plot obstacles. Still, the piece maintains orientation and drive under a largely causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous door → wax seal as key → transition to library → rope as mechanism → reconfiguration and merger → restored tower with reweighted meaning. Orientation is excellent from the opening; we always know where we are and what is happening, even across the surreal transition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is subtly altered (stories returned; clock now “holds space”) and Elias’s understanding shifts. The main limitation is the low perceived cost—nothing serious threatens him or the world if he fails—so the decisive act feels more elegant than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: Lorne searches, aligns the cracks, uses the stone, and achieves the bloom of hush, producing a modest but legible before/after. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the scene holds to a single continuous window with one central turn (the successful conjuring). However, the outcome never feels seriously in doubt—no failed attempts, reversals, or new complications—and the cost of success is underplayed. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, but with limited sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: climb, align prism with constellation, engage shard of hush, rekindle beacon, transmit message. Structure is straightforward single-scene progression with a clear, conceptually reweighting closure when the light intersects the rising sun. The main weakness is low resistance: the ritual succeeds essentially on first try, so there’s little sense of jeopardy or contingency despite the global stakes. Closure is present and legible, but the journey there feels mechanically smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: stormlit observatory → forecourt investigation → night of writing → dawn aftermath, with a clear accumulative/textural drive toward conceptual realization. Causality holds—his observations at the monuments lead to the insight about the fog and collective memory, which motivates his overnight labor. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes where memory lives and his role in preserving it, with the fog’s melting as a temporal boundary. Stakes and cost, however, remain largely contemplative rather than dramatically constrained, which keeps the arc from feeling fully high-stakes even at this quiet scale.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival → chant/filtering → perception of mosaic fragments → ignition and spinning of the knot → full message → internal reconfiguration and departure. The piece reads primarily as accumulative/textural, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of hopelessness and light—lands clearly on the page. However, the cost of this realization is light and the structural turn is unsurprising; the ending feels solid but not startling. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues, but also no particularly intricate structural ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: one scene, one pause in a difficult conversation, building toward a resonant readiness to speak. Causality is mostly emotional rather than event-driven, but the move from deflection-by-metaphor to “the conversation had found its proper cadence” is legible as closure. The cost of this transition—what is truly at stake if they fail—is only lightly sketched, so the before/after divide, while present, is subtle. Still, the piece lands a clear RR/CR as Elian reframes the in-between as livable and acts accordingly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    Orientation is clean early: we know who Elara is, what the bunker is, and when the gravity inversion hour arrives. Structurally, the piece is a single smooth arc—bunker to trellis to return—with an accumulative, experiential drive. Causality is soft but serviceable: the lift’s miraculous transformation into a trellis and the doll’s powers arrive as givens rather than earned turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she comes back altered, carrying the silences), but the cost of that change is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene with clear orientation (who, where, when) and a discernible arc from disturbed quiet to restored balance. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated checking of the vial and the prisms’ hum build a kind of soft progression. However, there is almost no real turn; the “crisis” resolves smoothly once she places the vial, and the long, repetitive outro dilutes any closing punch. Closure exists as a small resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: decoding window → illegal journey → waterfall/orchard → temple → murals → stairway → conceptual realization → return. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the throne is for humanity’s maturity, not Elias’s ascension, and that shift is on the page. However, many beats resolve via convenient artifacts (the ruby flake effortlessly disabling guards, opening the wall) rather than adaptive struggle, and the “system purge at sunrise” threat never concretely bites. Structure is linear and coherent but mechanically neat, with limited sense of cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: sanctuary established, backstory interwoven, the fading threshold escalates, the encroaching presence tightens pressure, and the decision to knock closes the arc in a charged poise moment. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens—her method (linking through scars) has attracted the entity, forcing a reconfiguration of tactics. Closure lands: before = self-contained emptiness; after = chosen reconnection with real risk to that stance. The cost of the choice is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequence, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is straightforward and clean: bolt → ritual → diamonds → emotional release, with no orientation issues. There is clear closure (he achieves his goal and his internal state reconfigures), but the path is almost frictionless—no meaningful setback or risk of failure once the process starts. The structure is a simple, single-scene arc that does its job but doesn’t quite wring cost or complication from the premise. Overall, functional and coherent, but not yet at elite-level tightness or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: crank use → presence of great-grandfather → realization that the truth lies in vibrations → revelation of ancestral deception → Elias’s resolve. Closure is present via a conceptual repricing: the dynasty reinterpreted as prison, with Elias’s role reconfigured from passive ender to active truth-bearer. However, the price of this realization remains largely abstract and unresisted; nothing on the page truly tests or complicates his drive. Structurally it’s coherent and self-contained, but the arc reads like setup for future conflict rather than a fully pressurized unit.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clean: find program → follow its patterns → reach gear-tree → unsnap gear → world reconfigures and his allegiance shifts. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change with conceptual repricing (possibility literally restructures the world), though the cost of that shift remains abstract. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with no orientation issues despite the surreal setting. The main limitation is that the plot feels like a smooth ritual rather than a pressured sequence—no beat seriously threatens failure or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: dust pattern → ledger → button → notes → drawing → reconfiguration of his relationship to the archive. Causality holds throughout, and the closure—him seeing the shelves as a “network of these small, bright moments” and feeling his presence matters—lands as a clear resonant reconfiguration with modest but legible emotional cost. The single-scene focus keeps orientation crisp and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) consistent. It falls short of the very top tier because escalation is gentle and stakes never feel sharply pinched.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: compromised digital channels → puddle-map summons → key activates hidden node → Marcus’s speech briefly hijacks public screens → alarms and escape. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the world where “indifference” ruled is now seeded with undeniable doubt at a visible cost (surveillance attention, alarms, Jenna’s probable loss). Still, the Jenna thread is set up as urgent but then dropped, and there are no concrete obstacles or reversals on the way to the broadcast, so escalation feels smoother than it should. The structure is linear and coherent but a little outline-like.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine is clean: past whisper → coded technique → rising manifestations in town → critical morning → averted final note, with a resonant return to routine at the end. Orientation is strong and the story lands an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure where the prophecy is held at bay but not destroyed. The main structural weakness is that the “critical” nature of this particular morning isn’t strongly differentiated in tactic or jeopardy from his presumed prior rituals, so escalation feels more asserted than dramatized. Still, the before/after (threat active vs. temporarily quelled) is legible with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: ritual sorting and folklore → Three Moon alignment → prodding the speck → emergence of the memory keeper → specks as keys → revaluation of Elias’s role. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the opening and the story maintains a single continuous scene with a solid before/after. Closure lands as a decisive change in identity and function, plus a conceptual repricing of the moonstone dust. The main limit is that the structural turn isn’t paired with a strong on-page cost, so the ending feels more celebratory than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: workshop frustration → strange glow → greenhouse → trapdoor → descent → discovery of the backward clock → conceptual shift. The piece holds a single POV and two clear shards (workshop/greenhouse and cavern) with no orientation debt, and the closure (abandoning his clock parts and choosing to follow the compass) lands as a meaningful before/after. Cost is present—he relinquishes his old project and role—though it remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. Escalation could tighten further; the descent reads relatively safe and smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the foundry with reflection threaded through concrete actions (scales, coin, forge, kintsugi repair), building to the decisive act of fusing the chip with gold. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure—his new understanding of balance and names—lands clearly with conceptual cost. The drive (reckoning with Lyra’s loss and his part in it) stays dominant throughout. The main limit is that external stakes are minimal and the piece sometimes relies on reflective summary rather than pressured on-page turns to escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the pattern of encounter–confession–laughter–release builds toward the final gesture of planting the tooth. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: he relinquishes the tool and carries the laughter forward, with the gorge’s “misaligned harp” falling silent. Causality is soft but consistent; nothing breaks orientation or logic. The main limitation is the low sense of cost or changed options—his path ahead feels much like his path at the start, only gently deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a single continuous scene with an embedded memory overlay, coherently moving from disorientation to triggered flashback to conceptual breakthrough; the accumulative/textural drive is clear. Causality is soft but legible: physical sensations → trauma response → reconstructed mask pressure → insight about mercy. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing, with the new equation re-weighting both his past suffering and the forest’s purpose. Stakes remain mainly internal and philosophical, with limited sense of external consequence or constraint on options, which keeps the arc modest rather than fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: present-tense market quest framed by childhood backstory, leading to a clear closure where the fragment loses its magic and she redirects her drive into writing. Causality is modest but coherent—fragment → market → merchant → canvases → revelation → return to study. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the final conceptual repricing (the power was always in the work, not the magic) lands. Stakes remain largely internal and intellectual, so the felt cost of that repricing is gentler than it could be for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: dust analysis → swirl → vision of the fall → inference of the object → physical search → activation of the mainspring barrel → release of the ghost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the room’s sorrow lifts, the cracks are reinterpreted, and he leaves with a reweighted object in his pocket. Stakes remain relatively low and uncontested—his success is never seriously in doubt—which keeps the structure from feeling fully pressured. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: frost messages → awareness of pattern → discovery of bottled whisper → prophetic warning about the next press → deliberate triggering of rupture → aftermath and leap. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: eternity as a cage is broken, his role dissolves, and his options reconfigure. Cost is present but a bit abstract; we feel that something vast is forfeited, yet the practical or emotional loss is more implied than dramatized. Structure holds under a mostly linear, causal lens with the small reflective passages feeding directly into present-tense choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: the dispute and shard are seeded, the meteor storm and ritual form the central escalation, and the decision to keep the shard provides closure. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens: his dissatisfaction → ritual → vision → personal reconfiguration of the stakes. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses institutional validation in favor of a personal, subversive memory practice. The stakes are modest but coherent, and there are no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: night fell unnaturally, the town’s light is in the box, Elara must use the stone and chamber to retune it, and when he does, dawn returns. Structure is essentially one continuous preparation-and-execution scene framed by concise backstory, and closure (light restored, balance regained) lands clearly. However, there is little sense of potential failure or complication—once the method is described, the success reads foregone, with no turn or setback narrowing his options. The cost of success is not dramatized, so the decisive change is conceptually strong but narratively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: factory shuts → new quiet → discovery of compass → psychometric vision → descent → lagoon → realization and renunciation. The structure—brief setup, object-triggered vision, single delve scene, and contemplative return—fits the length and supports a clear before/after conceptual turn. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his life’s project, with the cost implied in his decision not to follow the expedition into dissolution. A slightly more tangible beat of jeopardy or doubt at the lagoon itself could heighten the sense that this is a pressured decision rather than an elegant philosophical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal throughline (GPS failure → cave → slide as map → retracing sculptures → completing the circuit) is clear and easy to follow. The piece achieves closure via a resonant reconfiguration: she understands her prior works as a network of alliances and “completes” them by placing the slide, calming the storm. However, escalation is very smooth—problems present and then resolve without much friction, and the storm never truly constrains options. The structure is linear and coherent, but the lack of sharp turns or meaningful blockage keeps it below elite-tier execution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure through the seasons toward the pavilion and the stained glass discovery is clean, legible, and causally motivated by her research. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: night blooms and Lena’s own obsession are re-understood, and her stance shifts from restless seeking to contented knowing. Still, key turns (especially the decoding of the etched diagrams and their implications) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, muting the sense of on-page investigative struggle. Very solid structure with good closure, just short of fully immersive turns.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear: diary → descent to lagoon → debris messages as communication → retrocognitive visions → revelation of the lagoon’s nature → reconfigured lifelong role. The retrocognition and time-slippage are legible and anchored to concrete stimuli (letters, lightning, rising tide), and the story lands a solid Conceptual Repricing closure with Elias’s ongoing “parley” role. There are no major orientation issues despite density, and the single POV window remains stable. Cost is present but more implied than hammered: the trap “loosens” rather than demanding a sharply felt sacrifice in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal throughline is clean: the wish leads to the bottle, which demands conceptual labor, which in turn produces the town, and his key decision about balance turns the tide (lanterns brightening, structures forming). Orientation is strong from the opening, and the closure—a transformed town and redefined role for Elian—lands as a clear decisive change with a conceptual repricing of “creation as labor.” The main structural weakness is that the hardest work (conceiving an entire society) is compressed into efficient summary, so the cost of that labor and the risk of failure feel somewhat under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Who/where/when are crisply anchored early (Elias, the orchard atop the Needle Spire, hours after the last foghorn), and the causal chain from discovery of the wax shaving to immersion is clear. The structure is essentially one escalating scene with one reflective memory shard (museum visit) that cleanly reorients us and motivates the leap from phonograph to neural transmission. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: Elias’s role shifts from archivist to transformative vessel with a clear before/after. The only weakness is that the broader stakes (archives breaching containment, world consequence) are largely told rather than dramatized, leaving the structural arc slightly more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: egg hatches → vortex inheritance burden → ritual with acorn cap → portal → recalibration with great-grandmother → altered return. Closure is solidly on the page: she reconfigures the inheritance and her role, with a legible before/after. However, obstacles are minimal and everything works on the first attempt, making the structure feel like a smooth ritual rather than a pressured problem-solving sequence. The drive reads as primarily causal with a strong conceptual overlay, and that lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a clean, linear causal thread from sensor check → glue drying/zero hour → system switch → data logging → descent, with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Closure comes as a quiet reaffirmation of preparedness and method rather than a decisive change, but it does register as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration (he has tested, confirmed, and recommitted to his hybrid approach). The cost is conceptual and largely offstage (the implied stakes for communities below), with no real on-page complication beyond the distorted siren. Structure is solid but lightly pressured, so the arc feels more like a well-documented routine than a story that must end differently than it began.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: job → strange object → ritualized use → deepened understanding → legacy, with no orientation issues. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural; each pass of empathizing with stars builds toward the moment of “profound clarity.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the lantern now contains “the wisdom of a thousand falling stars” and she redefines strength. However, the cost of this realization and the narrowing of options stay mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a morning disturbance (fracturing ghosts), a ritual response (moving the box to the hive and mediating), and a next-morning outcome (new ghosts, renewed balance). Causality is legible—Elisha reads the patterns, infers danger, performs a ritual, and the covenant stabilizes—but the sense of real jeopardy if he fails is underplayed, softening the felt cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns, colors, and ritual actions build to a reconfiguration where unity is reasserted. Closure is present and coherent (RR), but the “after” is only modestly different from the “before.”

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    The causal chain is clean: urn fragment → clue → garage-sale logs → coordinates → hidden alcove → journal → realization about the time capsule. Structure is mostly summary rather than scene, especially the prolonged research sequence (“Elias spent the next few days…”), which flattens moment-to-moment tension. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of his life and the time capsule’s purpose, but the cost is largely abstract and the “quest” resolves very smoothly with little resistance. The piece reads more like a prologue or synopsis for a larger work than a fully pressurized, self-contained story.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece reads cleanly as an accumulative/textural single-scene arc: beach observation → kite incident → creation → relinquishment. Causality is modest but coherent (the snapped kite generates the critical second object; the tide’s return provides a natural endpoint). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the poet accepts both the sculpture’s impermanence and their own method as purpose, with the cost of letting the object go legible on the page. Structure is tight for this quiet mode, though the turn from “seeking solace” to “found purpose” is somewhat expected.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: diagnosis → decision to investigate more deeply → copper-wire experiments → transformed orchard → death with legacy secured, and the closure image (wires glowing, pillars leaning) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost (his life and spent time). Structure is essentially one continuous frame with time-compressed summary, which suits the accumulative lens but flattens peak-scene immediacy. No major causality gaps or orientation issues, yet the middle passes in relatively frictionless montage rather than a sharpened turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: approach → ascent via footprints → pedestal choice → tower’s response → descent, all in one continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Causality is intact—placing the amber triggers the shimmer and redefines the pilgrimage—and the closure (a conceptual and emotional revaluation of “homecoming”) lands on the page. The main limitation is that the mechanism of his “understanding” of the tower’s purpose is somewhat hand-wavy, with the revelation told in summary rather than earned through a sharper, on-page turn in evidence or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → listening to birds → planting → vigil → dawn, with a clear before/after in the jetty’s transformation and the luminescent roots. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds; closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive plot turn. Causality is simple but coherent—he comes to fulfill a purpose, performs the ritual, and the environment responds. Stakes and cost remain largely conceptual and spiritual, which keeps the ending from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: cylinder found → decoding the grooves → discovering the leaf’s second layer → obtaining a concrete clue and choosing the next step. Causality holds tightly at the micro level, and the world’s rules (cylinder → thermal function → wax transcription) feel internally consistent. Closure functions as a charged poise: he exits with a new lead and altered sense of possibility, though the cost (ongoing separation, risk) is mostly implicit. The drive lens is clearly causal with a light accumulative texture, but the decisive change is modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally linked—observation, anomaly, realization, decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when he reconceives “true north” and retools his family ritual into a navigation method. Cost is legible in his ongoing isolation and in the knowledge that he’s mapping ruins born of his own complicity. The shimmer’s arrival is somewhat coincidental, but it complicates rather than neatly solves anything, so the causal chain holds.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Kaelen climbs the spire to amend the Architect’s plans, enters via the skylight, confronts him through their chess ritual, wins, and the sky/world reset in direct response. The drive lens reads as Causal with a light thematic overlay, and the closure—world reconfigured, relationship reframed, Kaelen’s role altered—is legible. The “world trapped in a beautiful, joyless perfection” stake is mostly told rather than concretely tested, slightly softening the impact of the outcome. Nonetheless, the decisive change and its link to the exchange of secrets are clear enough to satisfy closure requirements at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous scene whose pressure accrues through repeated motifs (dust-words, pawns, breath, absence). Orientation is clean (who/where/when are quickly clear), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her liminal state revalued as methodology and purpose. Causality is soft but coherent; each reflection grows out of the site and its objects. The main limitation is that the decisive change is largely conceptual, with cost implied rather than concretely dramatized in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: pain → bookstore habit → stone discovery → feather conduit → experimentation → creation of a stable “home” reality → poised decision at dawn. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear accumulative drive toward the charged moment at the mirror. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: she reconceives “home” and is on the verge of a decisive act with real consequence. The main limitation is that key beats (experiments, risks) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the felt on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: tapestry → access to labyrinth → navigation → re-encounter of the decisive game → corrected move → inner shift, giving solid closure with a visible before/after. The drive lens is essentially causal, and the redemption DC lands on the page when he makes the elegant sacrifice and the world reconfigures (hush to rain). The main weakness is the absence of real setbacks or costs during the labyrinth sequence, which reads as a smooth progression rather than pressured escalation. Still, the structure is coherent and the closure unit is strong and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: defiant exploration → poetic probing → canyon reply → realization of danger → deliberate final poetry assault that breaks the spire. Structure around the ritual countdown (“months ago,” “three nights before,” “one final night,” “As dawn approached”) is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he redefines “forgiveness” and walks toward an altered ritual with consequences looming. However, the climax (spire crumbling; transformation of the ritual) is told briskly, and the direct cost or irreversibility of that act isn’t deeply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: each matched pockmark-memory deepens the central act of repair, and the acid wave provides a clear tightening beat. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his task from saving the statue to transforming oblivion itself, and the world (workshop/hull/sea) responds. Causality is coherent—narration → kintsugi effect → transformed statue and workshop—though the stakes remain mostly conceptual and the danger of failure feels soft. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with one disruption, but the cost at the end is more declared than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: quay → wrong turn → cave → tide pool → release → return to studio/world, with a legible before/after. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story builds through layered motifs (quay, shell, mirror, cave) toward a Conceptual Repricing: the promise shifts from preservation to letting go. Causality is simple but intact (wrong turn leads to cave; cave’s atmosphere enables the decision), and the closure has a clear emotional cost in relinquishing the shell. The piece avoids orientation issues and lands a quiet but solid ending.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: heat breaks → ascent → experiment → release, all causally linked under a clear, single-scene frame. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but the decisive act of letting the cork “leave” provides a genuine closure beat (a Resonant Reconfiguration) with his calm as the after-state. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never wavers. The only limit is that the stakes remain modestly scaled and mostly internal, so the turn from preparation to release, while effective, feels more inevitable than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: building the map line by line, waiting for the phone, and the censer’s changing state gradually tighten toward the decision to abandon the phone method. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the hydraulics failure neatly frames the current stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines navigation as ongoing solace rather than a way to reverse loss, with visible cost (accepting that the journey has no end, that the map will fade). Structural turns are modest but coherent for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → backstory of the relic and virus → encounter with the stranger → decision and activation → aftermath, with clear because/therefore links. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Elara trades secrecy (and truffle mission) for partial inner privacy, visibly altering her before/after options. The main weakness is that the stranger’s appearance feels somewhat coincidental as a pressure source rather than an inevitable collision, and the broader stakes (“world ravaged by the empathy virus”) never materially tighten beyond the local scene. The reflective exposition is dense but anchored well enough not to blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: find flower → experience intrusive memories → consult logbook → reconstruct woman’s story → adopt ritual, giving a clear before/after in his stance toward this particular loneliness. The single POV, single-location structure is straightforward and legible, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he integrates her story into his ongoing vocation), with a modest but clear emotional cost in carrying yet another sorrow. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative with a causal spine, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: chip glimmers → ants appear → cavern → crevice → doorway → choice with his own map, and the story lands solid closure when he commits to a new line and returns to the shop changed. The structure (shop to creek/cavern to doorway to return) is legible and scaled well to the length, with a single, clear arc from passivity to agency. The only softness is the somewhat convenient magical logic (ants and chip as fully exogenous guides) which undercuts the sense that his earlier choices have cornered him into this crucible. Still, the before/after is unambiguous and the cost—relinquishing safety in others’ maps—is conceptually clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: dreams → seer’s warning → clandestine departure → climb → grotto revelation → identity choice, with no major orientation issues. The closure beat—a decisive re-alignment of allegiance from mortal kingdom to celestial origin—lands clearly, and the implied cost to the kingdom is legible (“thunder cracked like the sound of a kingdom beginning to fracture”). The single scene structure plus brief castle setup is appropriate to the length. The only limitation is that the seer’s “final warning” is a bit under-leveraged as a ticking clock or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene: secret → decision → alchemical process → completed star. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of memory (from fleeting to tangible). Still, the central turn feels more like a foregone ritual than a pressured choice; the “revaluation” is mostly asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single evening’s arc anchored by the act of writing, with time-slippage thematically rather than causally destabilizing things. The drive lens is accumulative: reflection and image density build toward a conceptual repricing of his temporal confusion. Closure is clear in the final realization that his state is “its own form of blessing” and that beginning again is a rebellion, with the scroll and mountain charged by that shift. What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger mid-scene turn or external beat that more sharply tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene where attention moves from general atmosphere → screw → loupe → inscription → emotional and sensory reconfiguration. The causal chain is modest but clear—examining the screw yields knowledge that reweights her grandmother’s story and her own loss, producing closure. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural with a clean Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (hope and partial return of smell at a cost of acknowledged grief). Stakes stay intimate but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual framed by the “breath between storms,” with a clear causal chain from superstition experiment → crystallization → inscription → softened scar. Closure lands as an on-page reconfiguration: his scars become intentional, storied markers rather than shame, and the world-state (his body, the quill) is permanently altered. The cost—accepting a visible, irrevocable change to his flesh—is legible in the final inspection of his hand and the spent quill. Stakes are intimate rather than broad, but fully appropriate to the chosen scale.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Eloise arrives with a goal, sets up an unconventional method, contacts Alistair, has the crucial conversation, and releases him. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration as the spirit is laid to rest and the bottle becomes “just an old object” again. The orchard demolition clock adds a situational frame but doesn’t significantly alter tactics or outcome. The reconciliation comes without a serious setback or complication, so escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure follows a clear accumulative arc: arrival with the dictionary → deepening into the library’s metaphysical response → altar/cloud of words → dissolution and final convergence into a single word. Causality is lyric but legible: his purpose shapes the library’s architecture, which in turn escalates his task and leads to the climactic sacrifice of certainty. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the witness becomes part of the first page and a new word redefines reality, with an implied cost of selfhood and certainty. Stakes remain mostly abstract, but the before/after is clear and the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece functions on an accumulative/textural lens: a single continuous scene bracketed by whistle blows, interwoven with brief backstory and reflection. The central throughline—Elias observing, experimenting, and then conceptually re-evaluating what clocks do—builds coherently toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. Causality is soft but intact: his counting-backwards experiment precedes the “razor edges” idea and the final stance on clocks defining time. Cost at closure is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which limits the impact despite good structural control.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece follows a straightforward single-scene structure with clear orientation and a legible accumulative drive: observation → pursuit → dialogue → realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elias reconceives “intrusions” and “letting go” as connection, and the job description is reweighted in the final line. Causality is soft—events unfold smoothly without real obstacles—but sequencing is coherent. The main limitation is that the decisive change reads more like a gentle pivot than a pressured turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: rainwashed library frame → subway journey accumulating graffiti/data → return to library with notebook and emotional payoff. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: because of his heart attack and rigid worldview, she goes on this “data-gathering” trip, which results in the notebook that changes his stance. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration—his perspective widens, their relationship softens, with a legible before/after. Stakes and cost are modest and the turns are gentle, but nothing essential in the chain of beats feels missing or contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense frame, backfilled rules of the booth and disc, and a closing reframing of Archie’s role. Causality within the magical system is consistent (disc hum → phone ring → three minutes forty-seven seconds → sigh → reset), and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of the loop rather than a decisive act. There is a legible before/after in how Archie understands his estrangement and his potential “final call,” but the cost of staying in or leaving the loop remains abstract. The piece reads more like a meticulously described condition than a scene under live structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline—annual ritual → decision to finally document Melina’s proximate causes → completion of the record → offering the locket and receding jetty—is clear and closes cleanly. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative reflection), and closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. However, much of the middle is expository reflection about covenant history and prior disappearances, which flattens present-time pressure. The mechanics of why this year is different are asserted rather than dramatized, slightly softening the inevitability of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrive at station → encounter woman and exchange → climb to cupola and reframe his quest, all under a clear Situational/Accumulative lens. Causality is straightforward (rumor → woman → ladder → listening) and the closure—repricing the concept of a “cure”—lands coherently with felt cost (he doesn’t get what he came for; he gets a harder internal task). There are no orientation or lens-clarity problems, and the single-scene arc fits the length well. The one weakness is that the “rumor chain” that allegedly bound him by reciprocity remains largely asserted rather than structurally tested, so the external quest frame never fully bears pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure (three notes, deepening quiet, arrival at stillpoint) is clean and coherent, with each phase causally linked to the last. The closure—a realization that the map is internal rather than external—is on the page and clearly reframes everything before. Stakes and cost remain modest and largely internal, so the climax reads more as inevitable culmination than pressured choice. Still, as a lyric-quest slice, the arc is satisfyingly shaped and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: unbending and using the pen alters the anomaly, erasing the seed changes reality, undoing that erasure resets it, and the final reframing (“wrong soil, but they grew anyway”) stabilizes in a new configuration. The story maintains a coherent single scene with one dominant question—how to handle the “wrong seeds”—and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend with a visible cost (relinquishing the fantasy of absolute correction). Escalation is modest but real, centered on the brief attempted erasure and its emotional repercussion. Structure is solidly publishable, though the middle drifts slightly into repetitive mantra rather than adding a new layer of complication.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural single scene: they arrive with a mission, build a ritual of camera and signing, and reach a charged final cadence where “the world remembered, for a moment, what it had lost.” Causality is minimal but coherent, and orientation is clean from the start. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: their work symbolically succeeds, reweighting the premise that art/gesture can counter erasure, but the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. The lack of a sharp structural turn or explicit price keeps it below top-tier narrative rigor even within lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: past arson → exile → discovery of the archive → decoding tapestries through painting → map → hidden library → burning the treaty. Structure is linear with one compressed middle section (“She worked for weeks”) that still maintains momentum. Closure lands as a clear conceptual turn, with the decision to burn the recovered promise reframing the whole quest. A slightly sharper on-page articulation of the risk in destroying the last scroll would push the structure into truly top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Kael drums → garden responds → entangled memories surge → lagoon vision intensifies → culmination in integrated shared dream. Closure is solidly a Resonant Reconfiguration: he moves from test subject to anchor of a living dream, with a clear before/after. Causality is more emotional/ritual than event-driven, but the progression is legible and doesn’t violate its own rules. The off-page scientists and the “running out of time” clock remain abstract, so the sense of consequence never fully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: bet → navigation through storm → test of whisper vs shout → key unlocks chamber → realization about the labyrinth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s theory is proven and the labyrinth’s “aliveness” and the maps’ true function are reframed. However, the stakes remain small and the resolution is frictionless—no serious setbacks or complications emerge once the key appears, so the final opening feels almost too easy. The structure is solid for length but lacks a decisive cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: Anna arrives with a need, the guardian prepares and executes his shutter pattern, and Anna experiences a perceptual/emotional shift—an accumulative/textural drive that closes on a Conceptual Repricing of her father’s silences. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with no orientation problems and a clear single scene. The closure functions, but the pressure curve is relatively flat; the story never tightens options or tests the premise beyond the expected demonstration of his gift. The cost of her new knowledge (what changes afterward) remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from premise (quiet rebel coach) through method (window displays) to execution (midnight activation). Causality is coherent, and the closure—a charged poise as the town begins to “wonder”—is legible. The cost of this act remains mostly conceptual and off-stage (risk of discovery, emotional vulnerability), so the before/after hinge feels more like a continuation than a decisive shift. Still, for a quiet conceptual piece, the arc lands with a clear cadence and reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: scrimshaw → whale call → disappearing island → tree choice → return to dock reconfigured, with a clear before/after in her stance. The drive lens reads as a Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyricism), and the closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—the dock is no longer a prison but a shore of origin. However, the whale’s call and the island’s “demand” feel convenient and largely declarative, and the exact mechanics of what she risks or could lose by accepting or refusing remain conceptually soft. Structure holds, but the decisive turn could be more tightly dramatized with clearer on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative structure: daily ritual → memory of Maya → unexpected inspection → renewed commitment. The unscheduled knock is a clean, legible tightening, and the ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn. Causality holds, but the inspection passes with almost no real complication or close call, so the middle lacks a sharper structural hinge. Closure is conceptually satisfying, but the cost is felt more in idea than in on-page jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: ban lifts → approach barrier → dissolution → emergence with altered perspective, all in a single coherent scene. Causality holds, and the closure—a conceptual and experiential shift where Kael “had become the boundary itself”—is legible. However, stakes and price remain largely abstract; nothing resists him, and the crossing is smooth, so the decisive change has limited dramatic bite. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative/lyric dominance, but the escalation toward closure could tighten more around a concrete risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Leo’s longstanding desire → plant-messages to Lyra → silent bargain → obtaining the reed → using it to awaken color, with his return to the courtyard providing closure. Structure is straightforward but effective: essentially two connected scenes with no orientation issues and a clear before/after. Closure lands via a decisive change (color vision) that reconfigures his options and self-perception, though the cost of that change remains mostly conceptual and lightly touched. The drive lens reads as causal throughout, and no setup is abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the scene moves from silence and stasis to tuned sound, environmental response, and a conceptual reweighting of what the “pilgrimage” is. Causality is soft but legible—questions lead to experimentation (tuning fork, stepping into the circle) which leads to the room’s awakening and the protagonist’s shift in understanding. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the artificial pilgrimage becomes the only “real” journey, and the lab is redefined as a sanctuary. The cost is subtle and largely conceptual (abandoning a prior frame), but it is present.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is lucid: past rock-bottom → discovery of observatory → building a network of observatories through his jewelry. The global drive feels largely accumulative/textural, with a conceptual reweighting at the end around his daughter's legacy. That said, much of the piece is explanatory summary of how the system works rather than dramatized beats, so escalation and on-page causality feel soft. Closure exists—Elian's grief repurposed into a trans-temporal practice—but it lands more as a description of an achieved state than a felt turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one primary scene (Chen’s visit) framed by Elara’s work, with backstory and method folded in, and it resolves in a clear decision to “continue the work.” Causality is coherent—her research leads to discovery, which leads to confiding, which leads to a renewed commitment—but the stakes of that choice remain mostly conceptual. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis, but the cost of that stance is only lightly implied rather than dramatized. Overall, it’s well-shaped but a bit low in narrative torque for elite literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal and easy to follow: enter archive → activate pagoda at twilight → perform purification → emerge changed. Closure is solidly present as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the atoms move into her and the “end of innocence” becomes personal, but the path from risk to success is very smooth, with little sense of potential failure or complication on the page, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: shadows unbinding → discovery of the stone’s capabilities → decision to reconfigure the archive → library-wide metamorphosis → earned stasis with ongoing vigilance. Causality mostly holds under a lyric, conceptual lens, and orientation is strong from the opening (“blooming library above clouds,” Dream-Sharing Era). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world’s rules and the institution have changed, with visible cost in irrevocably lost hopes. The main structural weakness is the ease and smoothness of implementation; we’re told of the global fix rather than feeling it as a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single scene with one reflective spine: Maria revisiting logs and re-evaluating the chameleon rescue in the wake of the con. Causality and situational pressure are coherent—Eleanor’s suggestion to move on prompts Maria’s explicit stance, culminating in the decision to found her own sanctuary. Closure is present and legible, though the sense that she has already half-decided on “Second Chance Sanctuary” slightly softens the felt pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: tower → plant-telepathy epiphany → guilt realization → visit to Samuel → reconfigured practice, with a clear before/after around how she treats scars. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the plants’ voices and hourglass symbolism precipitate her decision to apologize and change her work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she reframes scars (and her procedure) at real professional and emotional cost. The only limitation is that the Samuel visit resolves without resistance, so the external beat feels more confirmatory than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single scene framed by one decisive act—performing the psychometry reading—that causally leads to his conceptual discovery. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from booth description to sensory immersion to metaphysical vision is coherent and progressive. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: he learns unused love is stored in “whens,” and this reconfigures his understanding of his life with a legible emotional cost. There are no orientation or lens-clarity problems, and the scope is well matched to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one ritualized scene that escalates through successive meteors toward a clear before/after (from blocked and haunted to rested and quietly committed). Causality is straightforward—aligning the astrolabe with meteors triggers visions that gradually relieve her burden—and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and that pattern is consistent. What keeps this below top-tier is that the on-page cost and risk feel modest; nothing ever seriously imperils her or threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: discovery of the charm method → practice → extraction of a specific spark → successful transfer into the world. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal elements, and it holds through closure, which lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the seedling roots and the clock ticks backward. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—the guard remains tethered to duty and dreamlessness while hope enters the world—but it reads clearly. Escalation is more tonal/intellectual than plot-driven, yet the single tightening around the seedling’s futures suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: perception of the forest builds to a ritualized experiment and a resultant expansion of consciousness. Causality is broadly clear (hum → arrangement of trees → harmonic key → controlled translocation), and there is a Conceptual Repricing at the end when the gear aligns with Elian’s neural network. However, the stakes of the “mystery of translocations” stay abstract, and the move from random to controlled travel is more told than pressured on the page. The final insights arrive smoothly, with little on-page friction or visible trade-off, which keeps the closure from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: vigil → traversal of the ridgeway → confrontation with the pool → retrieval of light. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, and the closure—the traveler drawing light/courage—lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing of identity as choice. However, there’s little sense of constraint or real risk; nothing meaningfully threatens failure, so the outcome feels foregone. The ritualistic repetition builds atmosphere but rarely tightens options or reconfigures stakes until the very last image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the piano’s silence → discoloration on the stairs → discovery and use of the bolt → opening the piano → reading the ledger → altered understanding and choice to remain. The piece holds a single POV, continuous time, and lands a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis closure where his knowledge reconfigures his stance. That said, the middle is a straight-line investigation with little complication or alternative path; nothing truly resists him once he decides to look. The cost at the end is conceptual and future-facing rather than immediate, which keeps the structure solid but not yet gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael seeds doubt via books, pressure builds in the outer world, and the pretender’s paranoia ultimately brings him to the library for the final confrontation. The structure—broad summary of centuries of work, then a single sharp on-page climax—fits the scale and remains legible. The closure is decisive (the lie-magic sunders, tyranny ends, Kael’s duty resolves) with a clear before/after. The main weakness is how conveniently the pretender “learns to breach the temporal drift,” which is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—monitoring, ritual, atlas page, then pattern recognition—builds cleanly toward a Conceptual Repricing of loss and change. Causality within the quasi-mystical console/atlas interaction is impressionistic but coherent under the lyric, slightly speculative frame. Closure is clear: his understanding shifts and his path literally changes as he leaves the station. The main weakness is that the decisive turn feels conceptually weighty but dramatically soft, with little resistance at the moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous scene, single POV, with a clear before/after—lost in the lull vs. reoriented purpose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build-up of hum, image patterns, and reflection leads smoothly to the moment she touches the stone and experiences a reconfiguration of stance. Closure is present (“The lull was over; the rebellion would stir again, but this time, it would be different”), though the concrete cost of this shift remains subtle and mostly conceptual. Nothing vital teleports or contradicts itself, but the arc is relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: telepathic plants → discovery of the kite → decoding the script → descent to the springs → unsealing the amber, with a clear before/after in the world. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, political situation), and the throughline never blurs. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing: destiny shifts from fixed to intentionally evolved. The main structural weakness is that the decoding and risk navigation are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens mid-story tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one focal timeframe with interleaved backstory, building toward a clear resonant reconfiguration when she reframes the photograph. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each pass through the garden, freezes, and keeper’s words layers toward the final integration moment. Causality is modest but coherent, and the closure beat (photo out of hiding, visibly honored) establishes a before/after. The reflective passages are frequent but anchored in concrete present cues and do not break orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: he discovers a method (untangling threads), mends the box, reorders the cards, and recommits to painting. Closure lands with a legible before/after—he moves from paralysis to purposeful creation—though the shift feels relatively smooth and low-cost. Causality is simple but intact, with no orientation issues. The ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive, hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: eclipse aftermath → investigation of the scorched site → ink experiment → conceptual realization → return to camp, all in one coherent scene. Causality holds and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing: he reframes time-slowing as a cognitive defense against oblivion. The “cost” is mostly implied—his life on the margins and the acceptance of that stance—rather than dramatized in a concrete sacrifice. Under an accumulative/textural lens the build is sufficient, but the resolution leans heavily on explanation instead of a pressure-laden final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward—she enters, uploads the letter, triggers the network, flees—and the piece lands a clear closure beat in the vision of inevitable council collapse. However, many crucial consequences are summarized at a distance (“Elara’s small act of rebellion had sparked a revolution”) rather than dramatized, which flattens structural impact. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative, rhetorical final third, but escalation is more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation and continuity are clear: single POV, dome setting, post-tower timeline, one dominant throughline of tending the roses. The structure is essentially accumulative reflection over a routine day, with minor beats (wind, evening, merchants tomorrow) adding texture rather than real turns. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: reaffirming her chosen path against the implied pull of her father’s world, but the cost is mostly inherited, not newly paid. The lack of a sharper on-page shift or constraining event limits structural impact for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/ritual structure: restive sky and garden → deliberate voicing of silence → arrival of the echo → altered cosmos and self, all causally linked under its own rules. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and the drive lens (accumulative textural ritual) stays stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he succeeds, the constellations reorder, and he walks away changed, with the goddess’s echo now inside him. The main limitation is that the cost of success is implied rather than sharply tested or complicated at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the phone call → her return to the observatory → the pen nib → the hidden floor plan → the reframed deaths → the decision to publish. Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and the investigation proceeds through understandable, if somewhat tidy, deductions. Closure lands as a charged poise: her options and understanding are reconfigured, and she commits to a new course with implied danger. The main weakness is that some logic is delivered in expository blocks rather than dramatized steps, which slightly reduces felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: restless firmware → meteor-amber acquisition → translated phrase from his own past → realization about his daughter → decision to tether guilt into a constellation, landing in a quieter lab and steadier hands. The story holds a single POV, one dominant drive (resolving old guilt through his haunted tools), and lands clear closure as Orion’s relationship to the firmware and his work is reconfigured. Some exposition about the letters and the device’s function reads summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting the impact of the inciting “baby cries” premise in the live present. Still, the before/after is legible and carries a real emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: discovery of the tile flake → experiments with the mandala → revelation about interjecting into the hush → physical act of pressing her palm into the center. The piece reads primarily as accumulative/textural but still maintains a clear before/after in her understanding of the unlearning, satisfying closure via conceptual repricing. However, the cost of this shift is more implied than dramatized, and stakes rarely feel pressured by time or counterforce. Structurally, it’s a clean single scene, but the climax lands more as serene insight than as a hard-won pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: she arrives with an intention, executes a single significant renaming, and the world subtly reconfigures in response. Causality is simple but coherent—her act with the tessera causes the sky and shadows to shift, and her mission clarifies into an endless, chosen task. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the plaza moves from graveyard to “garden waiting for its first bloom,” and her stance hardens into committed, costly work. The structure is linear and clean but lacks a stronger mid-scene tightening or complication that would make the final turn more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain (ghost → discovery of demolition → tarot coin → amplified performance → changed human decisions → renovation plans) is clean and legible, with a clear before/after. Closure is solid: the theater’s fate is reconfigured and Arthur’s role changes, with the coin passed on as a charged threshold object. The biggest weakness is convenience: the humans shift off-page with minimal friction, and the “temporal waves” resolve the central problem in a single, largely uncontested move. Structure is otherwise tidy and well-scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: setup of the problem and plan, execution of the ritual-like painting, then a resonant reconfiguration where the telepathic noise is reorganized, not erased. Causality holds—static shock → new ability → distress → devised method → exhausting session → partial relief and reframed understanding. Closure lands via a clear before/after stance: she now sees the pathways and accepts ongoing noise at a cost (fatigue, permanent sensitivity). Stakes remain intimate rather than broad, but the arc is complete and coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: Elara’s method leads to the glow, which leads to visions, which lead her deeper into the caves and to a second fossil, culminating in a new understanding of transitional objects. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing—she redefines the caves’ “silence” as waiting and reorients her role—but the cost of this shift is only lightly implied. Causality is clean on a scene level, but the global drive remains low-stakes and largely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: she enters the warehouse, catalogs buttons, the echo builds, the prophecy reconfigures, and she leaves with a new stance. Causality under the chosen lens holds, but the process from task to success is linear and nearly frictionless, with no meaningful complication of her plan. Closure via conceptual repricing (fate as lattice of choices) is legible, yet the cost of this shift—personally or for the village—remains abstract. The hourglass “deadline” never truly constrains tactics or forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: pillbox → message → coordinates → decision to send a snow-code invitation and vouchsafe Althea’s exit. Structure is linear, well-oriented, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR where he commits to sacrifice his own prospects for hers. Still, pressure on that decision is mostly asserted rather than dramatized; no concrete obstacle or temporal squeeze tests his resolve on the page. The “tomorrow” date raises stakes conceptually, but we don’t see options meaningfully narrow or tactics adapt beyond the single plan.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a brief, well-anchored flashback, moving from waiting to encounter to release. Causality is intact—the vigil because of the promise, the ambient listening leading to recognizing “it was time,” the arrival of the boat and transfer of the needle fulfilling the vow. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from being bound to the crossing to riding away with a new understanding. The main limitation is that the promise’s cost and potential alternatives never meaningfully complicate the path, so the arc feels somewhat pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → observation → mapping shadows → identifying the nexus → smoke experiment → conceptual and temporal resolution. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each tactic emerges logically from what he has just learned, and the closure (the anomaly dissolving) is on-page and legible. The cost—releasing a perfectly preserved, loved instant—is conceptually strong, though it could be felt more sharply in Kael’s body and reaction. Orientation is solid from early on, with no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline—summer flowers ending, anticipated winter darkness, creation of a light-reflecting system, and communal uptake—is clean and easy to follow. Structure is essentially linear with a light time-jump montage through winter, ending in a resonant reconfiguration as the community adopts his practice. However, escalation is very mild and almost nothing meaningfully obstructs his plan, so the climax (the first glow and later communal mirrors) lands more as a graceful pattern-completion than a pressured turn. Closure is present and thematically coherent but not hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: ritual with the sundial and stone circle → layered memories → conceptual decision at the edge of the library. Causality is mostly emotional rather than event-driven, but there is a clear before/after stance: from broken by reincarnation memory to choosing a new role. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—reframing her “curse” as an opportunity—with some sense of cost in her long loneliness. The piece is structurally simple and tidy; escalation is more a gradual thickening of reflection than a sharp structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: storm → nest discovery → art installation traversal → epiphanic flood → reoriented exit. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent, with each physical move (pond, nest, sculpture interior) layering toward the conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands clearly in his revaluation of secrets and self, with a legible before/after. The cost is subtle but present—he relinquishes his self-image as detached keeper, though this could be sharpened slightly for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous signals → misinterpretations and power struggles → Elara’s insight into trickery → covert subsonic interference → signals degrade and stop. The structure is largely expository, with the main “test” sequence narrated in summary rather than dramatized beat by beat, which softens the sense of turn and price. Closure is a Decisive Change—the transmissions are neutralized—and a mild Resonant Reconfiguration in the image of “celestial silence,” but the solution arrives without serious complication or setback. The drive lens remains clearly causal throughout, but the resolution feels almost too smooth for the scale of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: world-breaking spatial mutiny → nexus descent → organ-powered compass ritual → stabilization and key restoration, all in one coherent scene. Closure is decisive and on-page: the nexus settles, the key pattern is broadcast, and reality begins to discipline itself. However, the resolution comes without any real doubt about the outcome; the “mechanism long dormant” activates on first attempt, with no reversal or serious complication. The cost at closure is more conceptual than experiential, which keeps the structural arc solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-POV, single-scene structure with causal flow: find ribbon → enact method → complete drawing → decide where to leave it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his ritual is completed, the world is marginally reweighted by his act of witness, and he leaves carrying the cost. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, and it holds consistently through to the final image. Stakes are modest but coherent; there are no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: deciphered journals → copper nail into console → cryptic question → dangerous coordinate choice → partial opening of the “door” → re-stabilization and decision to leave, all in a tight causal chain. Orientation (who, where, when) is established early through the weather station and jet stream frame, and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with situational overtones. Closure is solid: Elias gains new knowledge about the station’s purpose and chooses to align with his ancestor’s protective silence, ending his exile with a reweighted sense of duty. The cost of flirting with catastrophe is mentioned (alarms, weakened field) but the danger resolves quickly, slightly softening the sense of irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is coherent: hitchhiker → flake → investigation → scaffold map → more fragments → realization of role → charged final performance. Structure is largely accumulative with time jumps (“Days passed,” “Months passed”), which function but diffuse immediacy. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what pixelated amnesty means and what “bridge-song” entails are reweighted in the final image. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized—her life is implicitly altered, but we don’t see a concrete foreclosed option at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clear: inheritance → sanctuary in the circus train → investment in Pathfinder → ethical drift and collapse → return to the train with a reconfigured understanding of cycles. This reads as a Hybrid drive, with causal events supporting an accumulative thematic pattern of repetition and return, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis when Jasper reframes cyclical paths. Much of the startup’s “rise and fall” happens in summary, so the central conflict rarely tightens in scene and the final “cost” (lost money, disillusionment, relationship strain) is more implied than concretely dramatized. Still, there is a legible before/after and a coherent arc without orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal spine is straightforward: insomnia and research → unexpected witness of Whitmore → revelation of prophecy → decision to collaborate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the burden moves from solitary fear to shared work, with a clear before/after. However, the stakes around the prophecy remain abstract and offstage, and much of the crucial information is given in explanatory dialogue rather than dramatized pressure. Structurally it’s sound but feels relatively safe and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: failed magic → last attempt with the seed → activation of the vortex → entry → emergence transformed. Closure is on-page and legible as both decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the lake uncurses and he exits with a new stance toward himself. The cost (risking himself in the cursed lake and relinquishing the seed) is present but somewhat underplayed; the outcome feels inevitable rather than genuinely in doubt. Still, structure and causality are solid and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear: vision → oak → clipping inserted → scar-link ritual → nexus encounter → partial reknitting → return, with no orientation debt. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the eclipse’s single point of light and Elias’s altered stance mark a before/after with an emotional and conceptual cost (he’s now bound as a “scarred link”). The main structural limitation is how effortlessly the covenant halves reconcile once contacted—no significant complication or failure beat tempers the straight-line success. Still, for this length, one clean tightening and a charged final image carry the arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: descent → preparation → ritual → barter → fruit/consumption → ascent with changed interior state. Orientation is strong from the outset and the piece maintains a single coherent scene with no temporal confusion. Closure lands via a clear Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian’s soul is “stitched” and his stance toward destiny shifts from grasping to balanced acceptance. The main limitation is that the costs of bartering destinies and absorbing another’s memories feel more declared than dramatized, softening the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: present-tense appraisal leads to memory, to thematic reframing, to a decisively altered stance at the end. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Leo’s understanding of where meaning resides in his work is repriced, and he alters his behavior (taking the cloth, abandoning the task, going home to “listen to the silence”). Causality is simple but coherent—seeing the unlabeled scrap triggers the recollection and reframing that drive the ending. The cost (walking away from the job’s demands and his old defensive posture) is quiet but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Maris studies the seed, applies her analogical method, achieves a breakthrough, then plants it and reinterprets death via the germination. The piece reads as a single, coherent scene with integrated reflection, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of “transition” as continuation—is legible. Still, there’s little genuine jeopardy or complication; events largely unfold as expected once the premise is introduced, so escalation feels modest. The cost at the end is primarily an emotional/interpretive pivot rather than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single ritualized morning in the atrium, moving from observation of the gears to smelting to inscription to handoff of the creel. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds well—each step builds on the last, and the closure beat of inscribing the Great Book and setting the creel for Elias reads as a quiet RR. The cost and stakes of that cycle are mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps the closure from fully landing at elite level. Orientation is strong from early on, so there’s no structural debt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The two-shard structure (discovery in the cave → gathering and aftermath) is clean and causally connected: finding the pearl leads to the ritual which leads to communal change. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with escalating images of light and confession rather than high plot complication, but the closure—Elias’s new practice and the pearl as understood mirror—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. No major causality gaps or orientation issues. The main limitation is that the turning point and outcome are somewhat foregone once the pearl’s nature is explained, so there’s little structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: graffiti → mapmaking → decision to test “bad waters north” → confrontation at the river → letting go of the bellows. The piece lands clear closure with cost—he forecloses the path of clinging to his father’s instrument as a guilt-tether. Structure is linear and coherent, with one main tightening around the choice to go north despite the warning. The main weakness is that the external danger (“bad waters”) remains largely symbolic, slightly softening the felt stakes of that causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: archway → deepening exploration → increasing temporal fractures → conceptual realization → exit. Causality holds at a lyric level (watch hums → detects delays → fissures she can step through → understanding of unspoken words), and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing with a before/after. Stakes and costs stay modest and largely internal, but there is no orientation or logic break. The final return of the archway/letters/watch neatly closes the loop without feeling purely mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: single continuous situation, clear clock (toward midnight), and a causal thread from research → realization → choice → disappearance. Closure lands via a Decisive Change—Clementine rejects turning the violin over and absents herself, leaving only the string and notes—with legible conceptual cost (defying an empire, erasing an immense power from its reach). The drive feels Hybrid (situational pressure from the approaching Agent plus accumulative portent from notes, stains, and plants) but remains coherent. Stakes could be embodied a bit more on the page—the Agent’s pressure is entirely off-stage, which softens the sense of immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive at the body, attempt the retrieval, locate the joy, infuse the chip, file it among others, reaffirm purpose. Causality is straightforward and coherent, and the closure image of the chip joining the “constellation” functions as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the dominant drive is textural rather than decisively causal, and the felt cost of this particular job versus others is underplayed. That keeps the ending from landing as a sharp before/after rather than a beautiful continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sweep → climb → reflection → descent → rebirth, with a clear throughline of caretaking and quest for contentment. Causality is soft but coherent: her ritual climb leads to a reframed understanding, which then informs how she meets the new soul. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts contentment within the cycle rather than outside it—with a gentle sense of cost (an eternity of service embraced). The piece is low on overt turns or surprises, but structurally sound and self-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from client arrival to ritual to emotional shift, with a clear closure image (the shard hung among the chimes and Elian’s revalued doubt). Causality is straightforward and legible under an accumulative/textural lens—her question leads to the chime arrangement, which catalyzes her internal turn. The closure registers as a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, but it’s on-page and conceptually clear. The lack of a complicating beat or setback means the arc feels slightly linear and low-friction, holding it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal line: Kael withholds, sets the exercise; Elara enters trance, studies ripples; realization leads to an on-page shift in her relation to the pond and herself. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with strong accumulative/textural elements—pressure comes from duration and depth of attention more than overt events. Closure is solid: Elara’s conceptual shift manifests in physical relocation and a new equilibrium with Kael and the grotto. Stakes stay small and interior, but there’s no orientation or causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, steadily accumulating perception leading to a conceptual reframe that serves as closure (“he finally understood he was not mapping a place, but a memory”). Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven but coherent: arrowhead → bird pattern-reading → realization about the canyon and his method. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with his “prison” reinterpreted as an instrument, though the cost is mostly implicit (the weight of his long stasis rather than a fresh price paid).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: retrieve keystone → exploit diagnostic window → mist walk past sensors → place stone → metaphysical shift → internal resolution. Orientation is solid early: who, where, and what he wants are all anchored within the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Kael has tangibly altered his own understanding and proven a different kind of magic is possible—though the cost is more implied than deeply felt on the page. Structurally, it’s a well-shaped single scene, but the lack of meaningful complication on the way to the altar keeps it from feeling fully maximized at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: lamplighting → boat escape → underwater library → ritual → altered perception at dawn, with clear causal links and no orientation issues. The drive feels Hybrid (causal quest plus accumulative imagery), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when his sensory world permanently changes. That said, the path is smooth to the point of low resistance—no real obstacles interrupt the plan, so the cost of success is mostly implied obsession and time. Still, the vow’s anniversary and the festival’s timing provide a satisfying, legible before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: universe contracting → intensifying static → clearer prophecies → final encoding, with a clean conceptual closure as Elara imprints information into the next cosmos. Causality is mostly “because/therefore,” though often summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The core decision (warning vs blessing) is introduced but its specific outcome and trade-offs are under-detailed, softening the climax. Still, the before/after is legible and the ending reconfigures the premise from observation to bridge-building.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: recordings → observatory → discovery of method → sequence of namings → decision to leave the monsters → exit into starlight, all in a single, legible scene. Causality is modest but solid—each step (her remembered phrase, the scattered light, the crystallization) follows an internal logic, and the closure (Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear before/after in his stance toward grief. Stakes remain purely internal, so momentum is more ritualistic than tense, but there are no causality breaks or unkept set-ups. The final image reconfigures the premise (reaping vs remembering) without needing additional plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: single scene, clear causal chain (dripping experiment → bell mending → apparent failure → viaduct’s note → reframed success) with a legible before/after in Kael’s stance. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, with the pattern of drips and resonance culminating in a conceptual repricing of what “mending the world” can mean. Closure lands: he does not fix the river but does re-tune reality, accepting a smaller, partial victory with cost (spent magic, persistent imbalance). Stakes remain somewhat abstract and cosmic more than personally or concretely pressured on the page, so the decisive change feels quiet rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous patrol-ritual accumulating toward the laying of the final photograph and the sensed “resurfacing” below. Causality is modest but legible under an accumulative/textural lens—wind silence as signal → ritual with photos → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with his nightly duty reframed as storytelling guardianship. The sense of cost or altered options at the end remains fairly soft, limiting the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece is structurally clean: single POV, one main scene framed by compact backstory, all leading causally to the crystal’s transformation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the movement from preparation, to starlings, to flame, to realization provides a coherent build. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the crystal is “unchanged yet entirely different,” and Elara’s stance toward her own transformation clarifies. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized in specific foreclosed options, which limits impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single scene of preparation and jump, interwoven with reflection on the lost jumper and the cryptic transmission, leading to the voice’s return. Causality is modest but coherent (static clears → silence and doubt → ritual checking and leap → static returns with voice), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration with the burden “lifting just enough to breathe.” Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; we reliably know who, where, and when. The main limitation is that the stakes of the radio silence and the meaning of the returned voice remain conceptually charged but under-specified in concrete terms, which softens the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: custody over the brain frames the conflict, Kael chooses vivification as tactic, and that act decisively resolves the clone’s existence. Structure is a single continuous scene with coherent escalation, and closure lands clearly with a before/after in both reality (dojo stabilizing) and identity (clone gone, Kael alone). The rules of how vivifying the brain erases the clone are a bit hand-wavy but still legible within the mythic/sf frame and don’t break the lens. The cost of victory is explicit in the ending’s isolation and uneasy self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: package arrives → investigation by tools → investigative failure → reflective pivot → earned stasis/acceptance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent and the closure beat (choosing not to force an answer) clearly reconfigures the situation. Stakes stay small-scale and internal, but the narrative still achieves a distinct before/after. No significant orientation or lens issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine—enter tunnel, work the ritual, free the laughter, bring it home—is clear and cleanly sequenced. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the house shifts from vacuum to held silence at an emotional cost. The accumulative ritual structure (increasing vibration, motes, climax) feels coherent and earned. Stakes and outcome are legible without over-explanation, though pressure could tighten once more before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: a static vigil disrupted by the pendant, followed by a deepening engagement that reconfigures Sylvan’s stance. Causality is coherent under this lens—the pendant’s appearance forces reconsideration of his purpose, and interiorizing it leads to the softened vortex and bent boundaries of light. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he is transformed from lonely guardian into content inhabitant, with homesickness repriced rather than erased. Stakes and cost are conceptual rather than plot-driven, but they land clearly within this design.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias decides to subject the crozier to successive approximations of vivification, each attempt shifts the state of the object and his understanding, culminating in a transformed staff and a reconfigured sense of destiny. This yields a clear before/after and a credible closure beat (a Conceptual Repricing of “vivify” and his vocation) with some cost implied in rejecting the church/guild role. Structure is straightforward, one continuous scene with integrated backstory that consistently feeds the present decision. The main limitation is that several approximations are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the felt intensity of the process.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: preparation, insertion of the fragment, deepening of the signal, and a conceptual shift at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias redefines what “signal” and “beginning” mean, and the fragment’s source is reweighted from cosmic to human. Cost is light and mostly conceptual; nothing concrete is foreclosed beyond his old assumptions, so the change feels contemplative rather than consequential. Still, the throughline is clear and causally legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clear: routine crossings lead to Elijah initiating his hidden plan, tuning the ferry via the radio, merging timelines, and achieving a stable reality. Closure is unambiguous (ferry anchored, hourglass filled, world unified) and fits a Causal lens with a Decisive Change. However, escalation is somewhat linear and frictionless: the merging works after brief adjustment without a serious setback or hard choice, and the threat to the grotto never truly bites. Structure is clean but feels more like an outline of a larger story than a compressed, fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → first failed attempt on the stairs → revised tactic in the corridor → successful eruption with insight. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each action growing from the last attempt’s failure. Closure is clear and on-page: he changes method, pays a price (exhaustion, burnt thread), and reconfigures his understanding of connection and his future work. Stakes remain somewhat internal/abstract, but for this length they land.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: introduction in the corridor, the teaching scene in the dome, and a short reflective coda in his quarters. Causality is straightforward (aliens → Council decision → new curriculum → this lesson) and easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the anchor and bioluminescent corals reframe the trench as a bridge to the stars rather than just a refuge. That said, there is no real turn or disruption within the scene; events proceed as expected.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: devices → anomalous pulses → intensified signals → music-box compartment → documentary revelation → decision to inform authorities. Structure holds as a single investigation scene with a clear midpoint escalation (stronger pulses) and a concrete reveal. However, several key beats—especially the discovery and reading of the documents—are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact and cost. Closure is present (truth uncovered and a new course of action chosen) but feels a bit mechanically tidy and low-friction for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: fleck → facility → cables → contact → dissolution, with a clear before/after and a visible cost (abandoning physical life). The piece reads as largely single-scene causal rather than mosaic, and the closure is a Decisive Change that lands on the page. However, escalation is more implied than dramatized, and the transition from investigation to surrender happens in a few sentences, giving the climax a slightly foregone feel. World rules are stable enough within the speculative frame, and orientation is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure—a single nocturnal visit framed by the accident backstory and the three-year gap—reads clean and coherent, with the ink ritual serving as the central spine. Causality is straightforward: he returns to help defragment Aris; the ink conjures the accident; that image triggers a reframing of survival. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but the before/after (from seeking “wisdom in failure” to embracing survival as wisdom) is legible. Stakes stay internal and somewhat soft, yet the scene resolves its own promise without dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: arrival → method enactment → realization about language’s transformation. Causal links are coherent (bone texture + copper veins + starlings + diamond → recovered syllables), and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure is a conceptual repricing of “death of language,” but the cost is largely abstract and Kaelen never faces a serious possibility of failure or reversal in the scene. The arc is satisfying but lacks a more sharply dramatized turn or pressured choice that would make the before/after more viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: undercover work → arrowhead discovery → phone surveillance → Jester contact → revelation about sister → Lyra’s entrance → renunciation, with each step tightening the frame. The inferred lens is largely causal with a conceptual tilt at the end, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the Jester shifts from quarry to wound/therapist, and Elias’s quest-symbol is discarded. Stakes and options before/after are legible, though the missing sister’s situation remains abstract and mostly off-stage. Nothing critical teleports or breaks logic; the structure is coherent and publish-ready at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is solid: visit to orchard → tacit pact with a statue → acquisition of shell → decision to play as rebellion → statues advance → music destroys them and halts the city → planting the shell for regrowth. Closure is unambiguous and on-page, with a decisive change in world-state and a resonant final image of the vine and reconfigured city hum. The main weakness is that cost feels light—there’s little sense of risk or potential failure once she starts playing, so the climax resolves almost too cleanly. Structurally, though, it’s tight and coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: neutral zone → timed shuttle → plan to create an absence → EMP bottle → successful smuggle → reflective closing beat. Orientation (who/where/when) is brisk and solid, and the story stays in a single, coherent scene with backstory used sparingly to tilt the present. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he completes the mission but recognizes he hasn’t found the place “where broken promises heal,” only laid a stone toward it. The main structural limitation is that no on-page consequence pushes back after the act; the success feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: search for salvage → wrong turn → hidden preserved carriage → halo fragment → contact → internal transformation and song. The story maintains a single, legible scene window with no orientation confusion, and the closure—Elian reclaiming his voice—is on the page and clearly before/after. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (disrupting a long-held identity of silence) rather than dramatized through concrete consequences, which keeps the impact just shy of exceptional. Still, the structure feels tight and purposeful for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: a sensed shift → spatial warping → portal crossing → immersion in hyperbolic story-space → return with a reconfigured library. Causality holds at a conceptual level and the closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the library is now literally alive. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt; her passage involves no real jeopardy or sacrifice, which softens the impact. Still, the before/after is legible and cleanly staged for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene arc: preparation → ritual with sunrise → dream captured → installation of the palette → aftermath. Causality is straightforward and there is a clear before/after reconfiguration when the dream becomes resident and the archipelago’s absence is filled. However, the process is frictionless—no attempt fails, nothing meaningfully threatens the goal, and the success feels inevitable once the ritual begins. Closure lands conceptually, but the lack of on-page obstacles limits structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival of the object, ritual preparation, confrontation with the fear’s defenses, and release, all in one continuous scene with a clear before/after. Causality is coherent—star → resonance → humming → mounting pressure → snap/release—and the closure (fear disarmed, joy freed) lands firmly on the page. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but the pressure wave and spatial distortion give the climax a legible turning point and resolution. The accumulative, ritualistic build suits the premise without losing orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: return to site → decision to study refracted light → manifestation of non-human beings → restoration of memory → decision to help. Structure is coherent as a single continuous scene with one conceptual deepening (the revelation about beings in the “glass between moments” and her protective field weakening). Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts her role and forms a “new habit,” but the cost and concrete consequences of that choice are only lightly implied. A touch more pressure on what helping will require (risk, sacrifice, or conflict with her current life) would strengthen the sense of before/after and raise the stakes of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene of recalling the exile, performing the return, and reconfiguring the relationship, with clear causal flow. Closure lands via a Decisive Change (Marcus returns, exile ends) and a Resonant Reconfiguration of their roles. However, the path is almost frictionless—once the ritual starts, nothing meaningfully threatens failure, so escalation is mild. Orientation is solid from early on, and the twilight-library frame remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: she arrives, plants the seed, gathers essence, and succeeds, with a clear before/after in the seed’s sprouting. Causality is straightforward and unbroken, and orientation (who/where/what she’s doing) is immediately legible. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the world now contains renewed wonder—but the absence of any real risk of failure or price paid softens the impact of that change. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, but the final turn feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly oriented, with the progressive unraveling of knots as a causal spine leading to a conceptual shift at the end. Each freed knot changes the situation (spirits emerging, silence building) and culminates in the last knot revealing collective fear and reframing grief. The closure—recasting grief as connection rather than confinement and revaluing Elias’s craft—is on the page and legible as a before/after. The only weakness is that some backstory is delivered as tidy explanation rather than as pressure that complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with embedded backstory (great-grandfather, journal) that clearly motivates the present experiment and culminates in the chapel’s opening. Causality under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens holds: research → setup → footage alignment → distortion → ritual → recognition of patterns → redefined purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the map framer’s work shifts from charting visible geography to bridging empathic silence. The main limitation is that the cost of this closure remains mostly conceptual, with no counterforce or real risk challenging the process.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: three transmissions act as progressive lenses culminating in the sailor’s scream that forces Elias’s conceptual shift. Causality holds under a largely accumulative, reflective design; each analysis leads naturally to the next insight and finally to his renunciation. Closure is clear—a Conceptual Repricing of “letting go” into “accepting its absence,” accompanied by the decision to stop. The arc is more intellectual than dramatic, but for this length it still lands as a coherent, complete unit.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure—a single scene framed by the storm window with embedded backstory—is clean and easy to follow, with a clear before (poised to work) and after (task completed, window closed). Causality is straightforward: the storm opens a channel, he encodes the message, the thunder signals the end. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: he leaves with his purpose reaffirmed and the bridge between worlds slightly stronger, but the cost (missing this chance if he failed) remains abstract. There are no major structural missteps, yet the lack of a sharper turn or visible consequence keeps the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: one continuous elevator ascent with a clear causal chain (find goggles → decode diary → learn legacy → step into new role). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the story adheres to its elevator-clock frame. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elara’s promotion is re-understood as entry into a clandestine tradition, which is legible on the page. The main weakness is the lightness of on-page cost; everything necessary to resolve the central question is conveniently available within this short ride.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative lyric: cable snaps, suspended drift, reflection, then landing with a charged image of circular clouds. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of loss as “spooled wholeness” plus the gondola’s landing—is legible. However, there is minimal sense of options narrowing or tactics changing in response to danger, so the middle feels like variations on the same beat rather than a development. The cost is primarily conceptual, and while it works, it leaves some potential dramatic torque on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: coin → safe → lenses → crafted sky → demolition → internal reconfiguration. The demolition clock and one-room structure provide a clear frame, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where Elias renounces faces and reframes his art. The main limitation is the lack of any substantial complication or reversal; the plan works almost too smoothly, reducing felt cost even as the library falls.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovering the hopscotch board → deciphering coordinates → matching them to the starlings → conceptual breakthrough → decision to present it to the world. The piece is essentially one continuous scene with a clear closure unit (conceptual repricing of navigation and Elias’s role). However, the stakes stay largely hypothetical—no on-page resistance, danger, or concrete obstacle tests his discovery or his plan to reveal it. Closure lands, but with low felt cost and relatively gentle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → approach to mirrors → engagement with gears → visionary eruption → assembly → shattering and reformation → exit. Causality is legible throughout, with the prophecies and eclipse expertise motivating why she can interpret the gears and images. Closure is solid—she completes the mechanism, the environment transforms, and her internal state shifts in a way that produces a clear before/after. The cost is present but somewhat soft, residing mainly in her emotional confrontation with the past rather than any real possibility of failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: ghostly signs → symbol decoding → exploration of arches → discovery of planetary system → cultural transformation. Structure is essentially a compressed chronicle spanning years, which keeps orientation strong but flattens in-the-moment tension. Closure is solid conceptually (they become the new gardeners, welcoming future star-farers) but the price of that shift is only lightly implied, not felt. The piece reads as a well-shaped synopsis rather than a fully dramatized story, but it maintains coherence and a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: ascent → revelation of mechanism → choice to merge puppet and pane → preservation-in-extinction, with clear because/therefore linkage. The closure—a conceptual repricing where the end of reality becomes a sphere of perfect memory—is strong and on the page, with the cost of universal erasure and his own extinction legible. The drive lens (accumulative/lyric with causal spine) stays coherent throughout. Minor repetitiveness in the middle slightly blurs the sense of tightening, but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: cursed orchard → prior deaths → blueprint + nut → assembled device → guided traveler → small easing of the curse. Orientation (who/where/what danger) lands early and the cliffside-labyrinth scene holds together without spatial cheats. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: another night survived, another life saved at personal cost, with the burden explicitly ongoing. Stakes are modestly scaled but structurally sound; nothing critical is resolved by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal line: prior refusal → guilt → ravine insight → lab work → new polymer for Marco. The single main temporal transition—from ravine epiphany to lab outcome—is efficient but summarized, softening the sense of cost or struggle in the middle. Closure is present and legible: she has changed her stance and taken a new, concrete action. The ease of the practical solution (no visible corporate fallout or complication) keeps the structure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal—two parallel transactions that clarify the rules of erasure and lead to a quiet earned stasis where Elias remains the keeper of endings. However, the second customer beat closely mirrors the first without adding a strong new turn in options or knowledge. Closure is present conceptually (his continued search vs. his fixed role), but the cost of that stasis is more implied than sharply dramatized. Orientation is excellent; we always know who is where and what the rules are.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: rain → tidal pools → pavilion entrance → altar → altered relationship to his gift, with no orientation confusion. Closure lands via a Decisive Change/RR: Kael’s ability persists but is qualitatively altered, and his options in the world are clearly different at the end. The inherited method of finding the pavilion and the descent sequence support a coherent, single-arc structure at this length. The main weakness is that the consequences of subsuming world-scale remorse are underplayed, softening the sense of cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: present-night setup, brief backstory of discovering the network, then culminating broadcast and morning descent. Causality is coherent—her preparations lead to the multilingual transmission and the community response—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the project shifts from solitary experiment to reciprocal network with tangible outcomes (agreements, festivals, charter). Still, most of the major “results” are summarized rather than dramatized, muting the sense of on-page cost and limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: preparation → activation → vision → resolve, with backstory integrated through the mirror and her prior research. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure beat—dawn, packing up, planning the next expedition—lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change. However, causality is mostly “and then” rather than pressured “therefore,” and the experiment proceeds without serious complication. Cost at the ending is conceptual rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: deciphering the luminous spiral → traveling at the inversion hour → entering the grotto → retrieving the crystal “seeds” → returning with a new mandate. The global drive reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture, and the ending offers a clear Decisive Change/Charged Poise: the world is now different because the seeds are back in human hands. However, cost is underplayed—she succeeds without serious setback, sacrifice, or on-page danger—and some big moves (e.g., integrating vast knowledge) are summarized rather than dramatized. Structure is solid and publishable, but closure would benefit from a sharper sense of what she risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single scene with a clear before/after: Eliara arrives, studies, activates, and then releases the sculpture’s song. Causality is straightforward and coherent—her analysis of cracks leads to using the insulator, which leads to the awakening of sound and the conceptual revaluation of the “silent” world. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: pressure builds via intensified listening, vibration, and presence rather than plot reversals. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and the cost remains conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it strong but not elite.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: he comes to the nexus to work before an alignment, reflects, and arrives at a new stance toward his exile. Causality is soft but coherent—his ritualized correlations lead into his reframing of the “eclipsed covenant” and his acceptance of non-reinstatement. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis, with a before/after in his relation to exile and the stone. The main limitation is that the “next phase” clock and political backstory never materially tighten or complicate his options.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a simple causal chain (quiet window → experiments with frequencies → conceptual breakthrough → clasp opening). The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative texture; each “type of silence” attempt builds toward the final resonance conceptually and causally. Closure is present—Silen succeeds and reframes the diary as a map to others—but the cost of failure feels low and the success comes fairly smoothly, with no serious setback or real possibility of loss. Orientation and world rules are clear throughout, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (twilight rituals → sprout → bud → bloom → wilt/seed) is clean, legible, and lands in a solid conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is straightforward and coherent: she plants, tends, observes, and the community gradually accretes around the ritual, culminating in the bloom and seed-sharing. The closure unit—recognizing the wisdom in process and community rather than the rare bloom—is clear and on the page, with a before/after in her understanding. The main limitation is that the plot never tightens into a genuine dilemma or risk; structure is elegant but gently flat in terms of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael follows the water, discovers the arrow tip, tests its effect, traces its energy to the core tree, and reframes her understanding of the orchard’s resilience, then decides to return as a student. Orientation is strong from the opening; we know who she is, what she’s doing, where, and under what planetary condition. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “resilience” and her role, though the cost remains largely speculative (future ethical stakes, implied vulnerability) rather than concretely dramatized. Structurally, it’s a solid single-arc discovery narrative but stops short of feeling truly consequential in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clear: town silenced → Elias surveys winds → instruments detect anomalous fuel additive → he locates dispersal mechanism → understands it as weaponized silence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of the entire incident (from accident to demonstration) with a legible cost in his failure to anticipate and the ongoing muteness. However, the investigation proceeds with little resistance or tactical adjustment, and key findings arrive somewhat conveniently through exposition-like description rather than dramatized obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrive, prepare, sing, catalyze response, and depart with a reconfigured world, which gives solid closure under an accumulative/lyric lens. The cause-effect chain (song → activation of sheet/aurora → cavern sings back → mission complete) is coherent and easy to follow. The main weakness is that the “test” of the mission never feels precarious—there’s little sense of what failure would mean beyond abstraction—so the decisive change lands more conceptually than with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: journey into canyon → marking path → decision to uncase flute → playing to open gateway → traversing consequence-landscape → gaining specific insight → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the flute and canyon shift from symbols of defeat to tools and spaces for ongoing, wiser guardianship, with the cost of confronting painful memories. The piece holds a clear single-POV, single-scene-with-inserted-realm structure without orientation confusion. Escalation is modest but coherent; nothing critical breaks causality or timing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious delivery → investigation and contact with the fragment → revelation of the celestial shard’s nature → decisive act of integration → arrival of others and collective reconfiguration. The drive lens reads primarily accumulative/textural, with each beat deepening his understanding until the press and fragment push him to a choice. Closure lands on-page: he internalizes the fragment, joins a network, and the workshop/world reconfigures into “consciousness itself,” with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the wider cosmic stake (stars vanishing) stays more atmospheric than causally tested, so the sense of external pressure is softer than the internal conceptual one.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: journey on the ridge → storm-enforced cave shelter → hermit encounter → dawn departure with reconfigured understanding, all under a single POV and coherent timeline. Causality holds, and the closure beat—the courier’s new way of moving through the world—reads as a conceptual reconfiguration of the premise. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with each encounter and explanation deepening the core idea of time-warped wonder. Still, the stakes and costs at the end feel relatively gentle, so the closure doesn’t fully capitalize on the structural promise.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual scene that moves from preparation to attempted communion to aftermath. Causality is coherent (ritual → tremor → visions → conviction), and the closure lands as an internal, quietly decisive change where he accepts subjective evidence as sufficient. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with the frost patterns and sensory impressions deepening rather than branching plot. Stakes are contained and interior, which slightly limits the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: brother’s disappearance → decision to recommence work → discovery and assembly of puzzle edges → bead activation → weaving “wait” into the void → sensed contact and collapse → charged choice to keep weaving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard redefined as threshold, her stance crystallized with visible cost. The drive lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative, lyric texture; stakes and sequence remain legible despite the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: obtaining the silk → descending to the shaft → performing the ritual → transporting and installing the arch → the changed posture at the forge. The piece delivers a clear closure unit—Elias has demonstrably changed and the world has a new, impossible arch—but the path there is almost frictionless. No major setback, reversal, or complication arises once he begins the ritual, so escalation is more procedural than pressured. Still, the structure is coherent and the before/after of both man and world is easy to trace.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: shard discovered → jump to alternate time → small but precise intervention with the datapad → return to a subtly reconfigured present where the Chimera Log exists. The structure—a present derelict bay framing one excursion into a brighter past and then a re-entry—is legible and well contained for this length. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: his life-story is reweighted and the “void” inside him filled, with emotional cost implied. The only limitation is that the intervention proceeds almost frictionlessly, with no real complication between intention and effect beyond the shard’s time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: sail in, discover letter/sea glass, ascend to the lantern room, relight, leave the token and stone-message, sail away under a reweighted inner state. Causality flows smoothly (lamp out → visit → letters/haunting charged → decision to signal back), and the closure—his altered stance toward his own silence and connection—lands on the page with a quiet but legible cost. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. Stakes remain modest and the lamp’s practical danger never tightens beyond premise, which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative, moving smoothly from establishing routine to deepening its implications and then to a quiet, resonant closure. The drive lens is clearly accumulative/textural, and the final image functions as a resonant reconfiguration of the opening. Still, there is only a faint sense of before/after in terms of options or cost: the world and Kaelen’s stance remain essentially the same, with no decisive turn in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—days of tracking sun trails culminating in the prism alignment—builds cleanly and causally toward the epiphanic turn. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: he redefines what it means to “magnetize stories” and reorients his life purpose. The transplant backstory is efficiently woven in and continuously tied to present action, so there’s no orientation debt. The only limitation is that the decisive change comes a bit neatly via a single, almost fated light event rather than through a more contested micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery of the sextant, learning its function, mapping dreams, then the stormlit tower experiment culminating in conceptual understanding. Causality is clean within that mode—each step plausibly builds to the climax with the tree and golden threads. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the role of trees and maintenance is reweighted, and the return to routine gives a legible before/after. The main limitation is that pressure never tightens into a true dilemma or costly choice, so the climax reads as a graceful reveal rather than a hard-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: preparation → playing the lute → spreading light → communal response → quiet aftermath. Causality is legible and consistent; the forgotten songs and greenhouse mechanics are stable and pay off at closure. Closure lands clearly with a resonant reconfiguration: the realm is partially rekindled and the keeper’s role reweighted, with some cost in exhaustion and release. The main weakness is that the prior failure and risk of another collapse are mostly gestured at, so the success feels a bit unopposed and emotionally easy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense decision window framed by a single backstory shard, moving from hesitation to preparation to departure. Causality is straightforward—invitation → remembered cost → preparations → choice—and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal hinge at the end. Closure functions as a decisive change (she leaves the library) paired with a resonant reconfiguration of her stance toward paradox. The cost of that choice is conceptually legible but only lightly dramatized on the page, keeping this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear single-scene arc: arrival at the tea house, seed-planting, interruption by the baker, shared bread, and a reweighted ending. Causality is mostly clean—her tending the sanctuary leads to the encounter and emotional shift—under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the “vanished” bakery is redefined, her mission reframed, and the bird’s chirp + imagined wildflowers signal a before/after. Stakes stay modest and the baker’s appearance feels a touch convenient, keeping this below top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move through the sequence of measurements toward the deadline of the Great Forgetting, and the closure beat—data preserved as the vows themselves vanish—lands conceptually. Causality is straightforward and legible, with no orientation issues. However, there is almost no meaningful complication or turn; each step is a variant of the last, so the final success feels inevitable and low-cost. The closure functions as a quiet Conceptual Repricing of “meaning vs. memory,” but without a strong structural surprise or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of betrayal → three tactical attempts → final successful recording → consequential choice about what to do with it. The three “false starts” structure the middle well, each failure tightening options and time under a clear sunrise deadline. Closure is on-page and legible: Emmie secures evidence and crystallizes a stance about how to use it, with community cost implied. Some key beats (the diversion, the federal agent meeting) are summarized rather than fully dramatized, which slightly blunts impact but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: ring activates → Elara tracks the taste/path → meeting at the convergence → realization/closure, under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is intact and orientation is excellent; the “forest elections / convergence season” frame gives a clear temporal container. However, the beats read more as a guided revelation than as a sequence of pressured choices, and the closure is a conceptual reframing rather than a hard turn with cost. It’s satisfying but relatively soft for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: painting → hidden box → charcoal → torrent of drawing → decision to leave, with no orientation problems. Closure is solidly on the page: he exits the cave changed, with his previous renunciation of art decisively reversed. The emotional price (living under the weight of mockery and self-betrayal) is legible, though the turn back to art feels relatively smooth and unresisted. A slightly sharper complication or setback during the drawing sequence could have deepened the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: discovery of the map → postal hub → zinc plate → revelation of the cover-up → decision to broadcast truths. Reflection and backstory are anchored in present action (workshop, council memory, weeks piecing fragments) and always tilt the current stakes. Closure is a decisive change plus reconfiguration: Elara transforms private knowledge into city-wide candor at personal cost. The only structural softness is that the investigative middle is summarized rather than scened, which slightly blunts the sense of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: he prepares the sculpture, activates it, witnesses the release of “truth,” and then departs, giving the piece a clear before/after and a quiet Earned Stasis. Causality is simple but intact (pendulums → vibration → melting → pigment → preservation), and the closure unit—his work being “done” as the season turns—lands conceptually. However, escalation is gentle and mostly descriptive, with few distinct turns or tactical shifts; many beats feel like lateral variations on the same idea. The “after words become unnecessary” frame doesn’t significantly alter options, functioning more as backdrop than structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: magnetic shift → static and withering roses → fixation on fear box → miniaturization → controlled burn at the magnetic pivot → post-burn integration. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and closure lands via a decisive act plus conceptual repricing of “fear as prison vs membrane.” Mechanics of the miniaturization and burn are intentionally impressionistic but never so vague as to break logic. The structure stays within a single escalating situation, maintaining clarity without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—locket → mailbox noise → clues (elm, archives) → letters → courtyard gathering—tracks cleanly, and orientation is strong from the opening. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s role, the mailbox, and the community’s relationship to their own stories are clearly “after” states. Yet the middle is heavily summarized and almost frictionless; each clue yields to the next without resistance, coincidence, or delay. The lack of meaningful obstacles or complications keeps the structure from feeling fully dramatized or tense.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: infiltration → decryption under surveillance → countdown → liberation → escape. The drive lens reads as Causal, with the spider-web timer providing a clean structural spine and a visible closure shift (web to phoenix). However, escalation is somewhat soft: the guards arrive and then essentially remove themselves via mesmerization, and the self-destruct threat never seriously complicates her tactics. Closure is present and legible but low-cost and a bit frictionless for the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: whale beaching → gravity anomalies and memory loss → divination experiments → infiltration of the chamber → ritual → partial restoration and reframed routine. The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative lyrical overlay, and the closure beat (seventeen memories exhumed; her route resumed with altered understanding) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The “method came to her in a dream” is a slightly convenient rule insertion but doesn’t break logic. Stakes narrow appropriately as the scene moves from docks to chamber to ritual, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is essentially a single ritual scene that moves cleanly from preparation to execution to aftermath; causality is straightforward and closure is clear (the prophecy is hushed, the world’s sound subtly altered). The chosen drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: repeated images of hush, brook, and crane build toward the final reconfiguration. However, tension within that structure is minimal—the ritual never seriously threatens to fail, and no real alternative outcome feels live. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, but the price is only lightly implied (his long labor, the world’s deeper quiet) rather than sharply foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the sugar lie → weekly teas → Elias’s interrogation → seal activation → shared listening → reconfigured relationship. The roof-to-study transition is legible as a magical shift tied to the meteors and seal, and the story closes on a clear reconfiguration (their agreement to listen together, lies reframed). Cost is mostly conceptual and relational rather than materially felt, so the ending lands as gently satisfying rather than truly bracing. Structure is sound and publishable but not yet remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece follows a clean overnight arc (twilight to dawn) with a coherent throughline: obey the shell, build the grid, archive the memories, then re-walk them as archivist. Causality is intact and legible, with each step (“begin with the birthday,” crystals humming, final walk-through) following from the prior beat. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she repositions herself in relation to her memories, and the last image of the silent shell plus “gardening your ghosts” lands. The cost—enduring painful recollections—is implied rather than sharply tested, which softens structural impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal line is straightforward: she has trained for years, uses the discovered ink formula to forge a confession, seals it, and decides to deliver it, creating a clean before/after in her life. Structure is linear and legible, with one dominant drive (revenge/justice via forgery) carrying through to closure. However, there is little real resistance or complication once the plan is introduced, so the middle lacks a tightening turn; everything works on the first try. The odd “who Marvel consulted” fragment also briefly jars structural clarity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene in the nexus, anchored early, accumulates song → revelation → public consequence. Causality is legible under a mostly accumulative/causal lens: he sings specific content, the canyon amplifies it, the Spire tremors and lights flicker, the city reacts. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—reframing “why some people echo” and showing the city’s awakening—with a before/after that feels clear. The main limitation is that much investigative work is summarized as already-complete, reducing the sense of live structural turning on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: urgent dreams → contact with Nikolaus → discovery of sabotage → Elara seeding the director’s dream → investigation and justice. Closure lands as a stable pattern—another spirit moved on; Elara chooses to keep diving—with a quiet sense of ongoing cost. However, key beats (the investigation, institutional resistance) are summarized off-page, softening the sense of earned consequence. The piece reads more like a polished vignette than a fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—parapet → fireflies → aqueduct → workshop → return—reads cleanly and causally under a textural lens. Closure is present as a quiet conceptual repricing: she returns home with her perception altered and a charged object (the whisk). However, the drive never really tightens; there is no genuine possibility that her quest will fail or exact a price beyond fatigue. The piece feels whole, but the lack of on-page cost keeps it from higher-tier structural power.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: investigation → pavilion/diamond observation → letter discovery → reconstruction → realization about OmniGen’s true aim and the diamond’s role. Structure is linear and easy to follow with a clear closure as a conceptual revaluation of the “curse” and the conspiracy. However, obstacles are minimal and much of the investigation is summarized, so turns feel more like exposition checkpoints than pressured beats. The cost of the new knowledge is only lightly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: fragmented frequencies arrive, Elias interprets them, recognizes the “observatory or the prophet” dilemma, alters the signal, and the followers disperse. Closure is solid: he has chosen a third allegiance, leaves the observatory, and the Maren prophecy resolves via his interference, with a conceptual cost. However, the structural escalation is mild, and the apparently dire prophecy (“The observatory will fall, or the prophet shall”) is resolved off-page with surprising ease, lessening the felt stakes. The piece reads as a single, clean causal arc with one decisive change but not maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: daily sound-catching is established, the music box appears as a catalytic object, and the ending recasts his vocation with a clear before/after. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural with mild causal beats (music box → realization → community of memory-bearers). Closure is present—he understands himself as “exactly what he was meant to be”—but the cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. The midsection montage of collecting others’ relics compresses time effectively but flattens on-page turning points into summary rather than discrete pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is clean: he goes to the marina, performs the ritual, it works, and he returns to the lighthouse with a renewed but essentially unchanged mission. Causality is intact and orientation is strong, but escalation is linear and frictionless—the ritual is prepared, enacted, and completed without genuine complication or risk of failure on the page. Closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (the world “forgiven,” the artifact safe for another cycle), yet the cost of that closure is conceptually thin.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: routine → discovery of the full lunar pattern → journey to the viaduct → activation and aftermath. Causality is coherent and the closure (the patience wave and Elara’s reoriented horizon-mapping) is legible as a resonant reconfiguration. However, preparation and difficulty are heavily summarized, so the decisive act lands as almost frictionless success. The accumulative/lyric build works, but a single concrete complication would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is straightforward: one continuous investigation scene in the tunnel, causally threaded through reflection to a realization and a new stance. Closure is present—she reframes both the death and her past and chooses to “reclaim her own story”—but the decisive plot turn (discovering “They walk among us”) feels more like a thematic nudge than a robust structural pivot. The investigation itself never faces a concrete obstacle or reversal, so escalation is mainly internal and reflective. Causality holds, but the arc feels modest for the level of rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Silas’s bequest → Elias’s unease → seeking Anja → revelation of the device → disarmament → reframed purpose, with no glaring logic gaps. The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end—Elias’s role redefined from passive comforter to active guardian—rooted in prior beats. Cost is present but mostly conceptual; the danger never manifests as a live countdown once the mechanism is diagnosed, so the climax feels relatively safe. Still, orientation is immediate and the drive lens (causal) is held to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is generally coherent—arrow → kaleidoscope → revelation of map → descent toward Bell—and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with some textural accumulation. However, the story functions mostly as a prologue: we end just as Zephyr begins the real quest, so the closure is a Charged Poise rather than a decisive change with on-page cost. The revelation map beat is effective but somewhat summarized (“What emerged was a map…”) instead of dramatized, which blunts impact. Stakes and options don’t clearly narrow in the final image beyond “it will ring soon,” so the before/after remains conceptual rather than sharply reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from noticing 2319 → finding the patch → fabricating the audit → tracing the ghost node → discovering the pocket dimension → choosing to broadcast is clean and legible. The piece lands a decisive change at the end, with Elias shifting from archivist to avenger, and the cost is conceptually clear even if not dramatized in consequence. Some large investigative steps are summarized rather than scene-ified, which slightly flattens the middle escalation. Overall, the structure is tight and coherent for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—council question → orchard walk → three mirrors → reconstitution → answer—reads clean and coherent, with a clear before/after in the crystal and the calmed ice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: futures are reweighted toward shared empathy, and the environment responds. However, the “weighted breath” clock and world-scale stakes remain abstract, with little sense that failure is a live option. The process unfolds smoothly without meaningful complication, so escalation and cost are more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: wake-up change → failed euthanasia tourism → disaster volunteering → marina scene → song-triggered realization. Causality is coherent and the backstory is efficiently telescoped into the present frame without disorientation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “sound of approaching endings” is redefined as the sound of persistence, tied directly to the shanty moment. The cost—abandoning the fantasy of neat, authored finality for messy endurance—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: sentinel → letter fragment → shared reading → softening → reconnection, and the scene holds together as one coherent unit. Closure lands with the couple leaving “in sync” and the sentinel returning to its watch, a clear before/after. However, the conflict resolves very easily once the object appears, with no meaningful complication or setback, so the decisive change feels somewhat under-earned. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, but the cost at closure is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: enter pavilion → create clearing → hear a clearer echo → deepen consecration → parapet exhausts itself → earned quiet. Causality is intact and legible, and the closure has a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion’s murmuring gives way to silence with the wisdom preserved, and the parapet’s stillness signals cost. However, stakes remain slightly abstract (cosmic forgetting vs. preservation) and the protagonist meets no serious reversals; everything unfolds in a smooth, almost ritual inevitability. Strong but not yet structurally gripping at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—moving through photos, arcs, and finally the emergent pattern—builds coherently toward a resonant reconfiguration, with no orientation issues. The closure beat, where the merged arcs form a living mural and Elias recognizes this as “just the beginning,” lands conceptually and emotionally. Cost is present but gentle (a life given over to this work), and the piece remains more meditative than pressured, which slightly limits structural impact at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure—single continuous scene, single POV, accumulative pressure—is clean, with a clear before/after: he arrives to study, then leaves the scene as witness-guardian. Each step follows logically: discovery of the crystal’s property → deliberate test (“Growth”) → heightened test (“Silence”) → realization that growth is decay → role redefinition. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis: he abandons explanation as his primary goal and chooses to hold and preserve instead, with the cost embedded in accepting the end of language. Nothing important teleports or breaks causality; the piece is tightly scoped and self-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: moving through the fog garden, performing the driftwood ritual, then reaching the car-hood monolith where the closure image lands. Causality is coherent, and orientation (who/where/what he’s doing) is clear very early, with no lens ambiguity under an accumulative/textural drive. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: giving physical shape to an unrecordable sound, with the cost implied in the fragility of chalk and his eroding memory. Escalation is modest rather than striking, so the arc feels more like an intensifying mood than a sharply tightening line of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: anomalous clock → diagnosis of orbital decay → leaf-based recalibration → station stabilized, with a clear before/after. The single-scene structure is coherent, and closure lands as a Decisive Change plus a mild Resonant Reconfiguration around repair-as-listening. The resolution leans a bit easy and mystical (the leaf’s sound as near-magic key) with limited on-page price, softening the sense of true jeopardy. Still, the global drive and closure are legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean causal line: Elijah arrives, meets Mr. Hale, the shard triggers the unfinished piece, the box of records emerges, and the symbolic reunification lands as closure. Orientation is excellent, and the single-scene structure is appropriate. Closure functions as a quiet resonant reconfiguration—Mr. Hale finds a measure of peace and Elijah feels he achieved his goal. That said, the central turn (discovering the box and intact twin record) feels almost too conveniently neat, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: key → activation → misaligned stars → fissure → shadow incursion → final loop closure, with each move logically “because/therefore” linked. Closure is solid: she gains an answer at a cost (physical exhaustion, risk, and the knowledge that the world remains broken). The drive lens reads as predominantly causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and this holds consistently. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what would concretely be lost if she failed right now would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: unsettling substitute body → visit to mentor’s estate/garden → encounter with child → decision to surrender the tooth → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is strong and the drive lens (causal with thematic emphasis) is consistent throughout. Closure is present and legible, but the “cost” of Eleanor’s choice stays mostly conceptual; there’s no real sense that refusing was dangerous or that accepting exacts a concrete price. As a result, the climax feels lucid but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: she walks, finds glass, polishes, remembers, then leaves a glowing gift; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under a textural lens. Causality is simple but intact, and who/where/when are anchored early without disorientation. The cost (years mastering a method, then surrendering the object as an offering) is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized. Escalation is more deepening than turning, which suits the mode but slightly limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene with backstory cleanly anchored and used to charge present choices, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when Elara shares the pendant and reframes the sanctuary as shared. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid: viral confession → retreat to data center → recognition by Maya → risk of further exposure → small but meaningful connection. Closure lands as a quiet but legible before/after in Elara’s stance toward being seen. Stakes stay intimate and never quite knife-edge, but they’re consistent and resolved with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: blocked writer → seashell revelation → sequence of hope-encounters → return to workshop and renewed writing. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each collected hope building toward the final reconfiguration of his role. However, the central night’s events progress almost frictionlessly—no encounter meaningfully threatens failure or changes his tactics. Closure is clear but the path to it feels more ritualistic than pressured, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece is well-structured as a single ritual scene that accumulates toward closure: Elias completes the repair, initiates the song, and the sacred practices are restored. Causality is simple but coherent—song → automaton awakening → vine response → restoration—fitting an accumulative/lyric drive. However, there is almost no complication or turn beyond a steady intensification of magic, so the sense of “before/after” change is conceptually clear but dramatically soft. The cost of success (years of work, isolation) is gestured to rather than forced into the present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative ritual: prepare the pattern, deploy the starlight, capture and seal the map, with clear because/therefore linkages at each step. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—the knowledge has been preserved again—yet the before/after doesn’t feel meaningfully reweighted beyond “the cyclical duty continues.” The world-paused wars and forty-three-year alignment raise conceptual stakes but never feed back into a concrete complication or cost on the page. As a result, the scene is coherent and complete but dramatically low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: study → reconstruction → test → partial success, producing a coherent before/after. Causality is intact—his mapping and adjustments plausibly lead to the successful capture of an old festival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the cellar of reason and future scarcity reframing what we’ve seen. Still, escalation is mild and largely foregone; nothing meaningfully threatens failure or forces him to change tactics beyond linear diligence, so the climax feels more like confirmation than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is clean: we move from arrival, to preparation, to orientation, to transformation, to aftermath without causality breaks. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara becomes part of the grotto, with the cost of being trapped and the gain of burden-perception made explicit. The piece holds an accumulative/textural drive lens, with pattern and imagery tightening toward the calcification moment. The main limit is that the procedural steps (orientation, timing with starlight) are described but not used to generate additional on-page problems or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear beginning (pre-work contemplation), middle (active carving interleaved with reflection), and end (completion and reconfiguration of grief). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via the carving’s emergence and the kettle/clock framing, culminating in a resonant completion image. Causality is straightforward and coherent; each move follows naturally from the last, with no orientation debt. The closure—a quiet but legible reweighting of her relationship to grief and craft—lands with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—Elias stalled in the lagoon, trying different internal tactics (collecting stories, reciting memories) until he reinterprets their purpose—holds together cleanly and closure is legible. The decisive change comes when he realizes the stories are for him, not the ghost, leading to his choice to walk toward the lagoon’s edge. That said, the middle feels slightly static, reiterating mood rather than adding new constraints or knowledge, which softens structural tension. The cost of leaving (what he loses by stepping away) is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the closure from fully landing at a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival → exploration → first water flow → emerging pattern → redefinition of the terminal and her quest. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration (the maze becoming a map and the terminal shifting from mausoleum to workshop), but the cost is soft and mostly implied. There’s no strong structural turn that tightens options or genuinely threatens failure; the valve’s minor resistance is the only friction. The throughline is coherent and legible, yet feels more like a meditation than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one primary morning scene plus a brief coda, all under an accumulative/textural lens where sound, silence, and memory build toward a quiet reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact—rain ends, he’s drawn to the forecourt, the experience prompts realization, which reorients his future behavior. Closure is solidly on the page in his revaluation of the “abandoned dream,” though the cost of this turn is implied more than sharply dramatized. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: long pursuit → present attempt using instincts/sundial → discovery of the wagon → reveal of the schematics → conceptual revaluation of the legend and his life. The piece fits a tight single-scene causal lens with reflection interleaved in ways that consistently tilt the present rather than stalling it. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the legend’s “treasure” and his own “wasted” life are both revalued with a legible cost (loss of his old purpose). The only limitation is that the external salvage unfolds almost too smoothly, so structural pressure never quite peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: Elias arrives, decodes the rope, summons the weaver, undergoes a brief trial, and leaves changed. Causality holds (decoding → recognition by weaver → revelation of methods), and the single-scene frame is easy to track. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he’s gained the weavers’ knowledge and carries it away, with a quiet “before/after” marked by the fulgurite’s pulse. The main weakness is the low visible cost: the weavers’ acceptance feels almost guaranteed once he starts decoding, so the outcome never feels genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from the harbor and last ship, through exploration of the garden’s logic, into the focused act of writing the gardener’s “living obituary,” and close with the finished piece and a reweighted final image. Causality is modest but coherent—his observations about absence and healing motivate the choice of subject and inflect the writing scene. Closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: finishing the piece leaves him both “profoundly lonely and breathtakingly present,” a legible before/after stance. The main limitation is that stakes and options don’t notably narrow; the piece deepens rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the egg → years of building → present activation → palace’s unraveling and bird’s rebirth → Kael’s death and world’s reconfiguration, with clear cost. The scene holds a single coherent drive, and the closure is decisive and on-page: the anchors snap, the palace falls, the bird’s song remakes the world. Some elements (how exactly the egg “reawakens” the world, what happens beyond the cavern) remain abstract, leaning on mythic shorthand rather than dramatized consequence, which slightly softens the structural rigor. Still, for this scope, the lens holds and the before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is essentially a single accumulative scene: patrol → planting → coin ritual → reframed self-image, which reads cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she sees “not an arsonist’s daughter, but a firefighter,” with the sapling and coin anchoring the before/after. Causality is light but coherent—her past leads to this ritual, and each step follows logically from her credo—yet there’s no significant turn or complication within the scene. The cost of this reconfiguration remains mostly conceptual and could be sharpened by one concrete point of resistance or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a breadcrumb sequence (cherub → fish fountain/coin → ripples → sapling) leading causally and texturally to the box opening. Orientation is solid early—who he is, where they are, and what the mission is are all clear—and the drive lens (accumulative with light causal linkage) holds through closure. The ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration: Kael opens the box, repurposes his relationship to the memories, and leaves the object, with a legible emotional cost. Escalation is gentle rather than gripping, but nothing breaks causality or muddies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the gear → transit to the center → integration and aftermath, with each step causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the garden’s harmony becomes a “symphony of light and logic,” with the sentimentalist’s purpose “fulfilled yet altered.” Stakes and cost (loss of unquantified emotion, new order imposed) are legible on the page. The drive is more atmospheric than sharply plotted, so escalation feels gentle rather than tightening around a decisive, pressured turn, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: greenhouse → ribbon → memory of grandfather → decision to carve the migration → closing walk home. Causality is soft but coherent, appropriate to a lyric/accumulative drive lens, and the closure image (grief as passage/migration) lands on the page. There is a genuine before/after in how he understands his work, though the cost is more conceptual than dramatically felt. Some beats lightly echo each other without adding new pressure, but they don’t break the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clear: past failure → lifelong penance → present ritual timed to the pendulum pause → felt internal shift. Structure is cleanly single-scene with integrated backstory, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when his shame “finally beginning to fade.” The drive is more accumulative/ritualistic than strongly plot-driven, so while coherent, the arc feels contemplative rather than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal line is clean: fraying tapestry → identification of Captain Foster’s thread → decoding and resolution, all anchored in a single continuous night in the silo. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the drive lens (causal with a textural overlay) stays stable through closure. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where Foster’s echo can release and Elias slightly reframes his mission—is on the page and legible. The main limitation is that the jeopardy (echo-systems collapsing) remains conceptual; no near-failure or significant complication sharpens the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece functions on an accumulative/textural lens: climb → poised blank page → writing → world’s subtle response → descent and aftermath. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (his “ignorance now a map” and the lake thawing), with a legible before/after. Causality remains somewhat soft—his writing and the ice cracking feel more symbolically than dramatically linked, and cost is minimal—so the structural arc reads more as ritual than as pressured choice. Still, the scene is coherent, temporally clean, and lands a clear ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: pirate broadcast → deciphered lyric instruction → crystal discovery → song reanimating dust → famine breaking. Orientation is clear from early on (who he is, where he is, what the famine is), and the single-POV, single throughline holds. Closure lands on-page with a decisive before/after (dead hall vs. reawakened library of stories) and a coherent cost in the radio’s silence and the crystal dimming. The main weakness is that key turns (the crystal’s appearance and function) feel somewhat convenient and lightly contested, reducing structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a single continuous scene with a clean causal throughline: chair slowing → recognition “time had come” → ritual of powdering → transformed mask → shifted stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from chasing a mirage of safety to accepting fragility and finding “a reason to keep going.” The accumulative/lyric drive lens is consistent—pressure is textural rather than event-driven, and the ending reweights prior imagery. Structure is sound and fully publishable, but the lack of a sharper hinge moment or explicit cost keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: cog discovery → deeper investigation → revelation of older Alexandria → tremors/flood forcing emergence with the evidence. The structure is mostly linear with manageable reflective summary, and the closure (emerging with artifacts and a clarified sense of his role) reads as a conceptual reconfiguration. However, the external crisis (tremors/flood) feels coincidental, not meaningfully tied to his pursuit or choices. Stakes around becoming an enemy of the state remain hypothetical, never tested or complicated by any on-page encounter, which keeps the arc somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous accumulative scene in the library framed around a rehearsal, with backstory woven in cleanly via the rosette. Causality is modest but legible: her long mission → need to justify the zither → decision to rehearse old tunes → small interpersonal discoveries and a reaffirmed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final lamp-lit image and her reflection crystallize the cost of ongoing, unglamorous preservation work. Stakes never tighten into a real test, but the accumulative/textural drive is consistent and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: greenhouse → alignment → planting with synaptic focus → growth and pruning → fruit → her redistribution choice, with no orientation issues. The story follows a tight ritual-like structure whose beats accumulate meaning rather than hinge on big reversals, but the final decision not to consume the fruit provides a real reconfiguration. The alignment as a ticking frame and the staged plant development give the piece a clear beginning, middle, and end. Cost is present conceptually (she forgoes immediate knowledge and power) but the threat of failure or alternative paths could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias climbs the tower to find a way to preserve the drones’ meaning, uses the riddle to access the log, and then transforms that discovery into a gift for the girl. Orientation (who/where/when) is established very early and remains stable, with no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: by giving up his secret box, Elias shifts from private solace to shared wonder, echoed by the lamp reigniting. The main limitation is that the middle beats (up the stairs, finding the panel) are low-resistance, so structural tension is more meditative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: observation of a vibrant house → discovery and activation of the shard → decision to sanctify via object displacement → departure with a reweighted understanding. The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules (houses as awake, sanctifiable) are affirmed with a new tool. Stakes and cost are relatively low, but the before/after of the cottage’s state and Elias’s certainty are legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: we move from static vigil to outside intrusion (divers, ampoule) to conceptual revelation and a reconfigured response. Causality is coherent—he investigates the ampoule, experiences the cascade of concepts, and then chooses a mode of reply that reflects what he’s learned. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from isolation to an initiated dialogue, with the cost of breaking his eternal certainty implied. Stakes remain more conceptual than concrete (no specific threat from the surface is dramatized), which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: imprisonment on the infinite staircase → decision to attack it with proofs → execution of those proofs → structural collapse and exit into a new space. The story adheres to a single-scene causal lens with no orientation issues, and the rupture clearly functions as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is mostly implied (years trapped, psychic wear) rather than freshly exacted in the climactic moment, which softens impact slightly. Still, the structure feels coherent and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: ascent to the rooftop, preparation, moon/daydream experiment, realization, then inscription and quiet resolution. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each move arises naturally from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she verifies that her kindness persists and internalizes that proof as a permanent canvas. The piece would reach a higher tier with one sharper tightening of options or a more palpable sense of what failure tonight would mean beyond disappointment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene with accumulative pressure: tremor → fresco loss → decision to bake initials → charged communal meal. Causality is clean under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure lands via a conceptual repricing—mourning art as kin, enacted through the bread. The Orientation Test is fully passed; who/where/when are clear quickly despite the lyric style. The cost of their situation (displacement, vanishing art, reliance on ritual over tools like the lens) is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: arrival at low tide → discovery/use of the yoyo → activation of the hunger stone → rupture and unraveling. The piece holds a single continuous scene with a clear before/after and a decisive act that triggers closure. The cost is on-page (his dissolution and the world’s forgetting), making the conceptual repricing of time legible. There are no orientation or lens-consistency issues, and the ending’s shift to cosmic scale still tracks from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: resuscitation → curse → arrival at funhouse → mirror paths → terrifying choice → embrace → reframe as art. Causality is coherent, and the closure (accepting and controlling the transformation) is legible with a before/after. The “by morning, I understood…” line telescopes a potentially rich beat and softens the immediacy of the climax’s cost. Still, the single-scene frame with integrated backstory fits the length and lands a clear Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative/textural arc—blue hour → composition’s swell → silence/renewed composition—forms a coherent structure with a clear RR-style closure. However, pressure doesn’t really tighten; the clouds’ “resonance” omen suggests potential danger or change that never materializes as a real test. Past events (the storm, visitors) are summarized rather than dramatized beats, so they don’t reshape present options. The ending returns to the initial state with slightly heightened articulation of the premise, but without a strongly reweighted before/after or explicit cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: gate closure → watchers → pattern recognition → shell crack → father’s message/device → communication and redefined purpose. Structure balances backstory with present action without losing orientation, and the discovery of the hidden compartment is a decisive structural turn. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her understanding of the watchers and her role shifts with clear before/after. Some key developments (the horrors beyond the gate, the transformation of the expedition) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the climax’s immediacy and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → discovery of the letter → reflection connecting lie to present → confrontation → struggle → moral appeal that shifts the master. Closure lands with a decisive change—Elias leaves with the letter and the lie’s guardianship is broken—with an implied broader cost to social stability. Structure is simple but effective for the length, with one continuous scene and a clear build. The stakes remain mostly conceptual, which softens the felt cost at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: single scene, single POV, a clear temporal window (bridge up/bridge down), and an ending that lands as a resonant reconfiguration of his ongoing work. The accumulative drive (ritual → observations → note placements → final mapping) is coherent and never confusing. However, the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than dramatically earned; nothing in the final beat decisively alters his options or stance beyond restating his ongoing mission. This makes the piece feel polished but not yet indispensable in terms of story movement.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid: anomaly in the stamp → experiment with heat → discovery of coordinates → cross-referencing → conceptual revaluation of the city and his task. Structure is linear, focused, and lands a clear Conceptual Repricing closure as he corrects the historical record. The main weakness is that stakes remain almost entirely intellectual and professional, so the felt cost of this structural turn is modest. Orientation (who/where/when) is excellent from the opening and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single present-tense work session, anchored by a clear backstory of Liora’s fall and the shadow’s detachment, progressing through the crafting of one crane to the tableau of seventeen. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tightening comes from moving from general process to tonight’s specific task—capturing her laughter—and then to the flock as a potential reassembly. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he reaffirms the delusion with full awareness of its cost and sets the new crane among the others. The piece is more meditative than eventful, but causality and before/after are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-moment in the observatory with controlled dips into backstory and conceptual exposition, building toward Elias choosing his first “descent” target. Causality is coherent—his trauma → obsession with potential → use of the Mapper → decision to investigate a classroom tragedy—and the piece closes with a Charged Poise beat (he commits to the hunt). The drive lens is primarily accumulative: each layer of explanation and image reweights the central act rather than generating reversals, and this holds to the end. The main limitation is that the “descent” and its risks are abstracted, so the cost at closure is more implied than sharply legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: pilgrim → chip → drone launch → energy barrier → override → data download → dawn return, and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of belonging. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and maintained, and the scene escalates in a legible way from routine reconnaissance to contact with an anomalous field and non-human data. The main weakness is that the cost of success remains largely conceptual and idealized, so the before/after shift in options is more intellectual than pressurized. Still, the story lands a coherent closure image with a clear sense of having crossed a threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure: terrace present anchored early, backstory woven in as revelations that tilt the current conversation. Causality is solid: his work → brother’s suicide → marital collapse → this confrontation → new shared path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise, with the invitation to the shore and Mara’s conditional acceptance clearly marking a before/after in how the burden is carried. A touch more on-page resistance or complication in the middle of the talk could heighten the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single causal scene leading to a quiet but legible resonant reconfiguration: Julian moves from guilt-bound to partially released. Orientation is excellent and the moon-phase method, apology, and exchange connect causally. However, very little goes wrong or even threatens to; the apology has already been delivered off-page, and the trade itself is nearly frictionless, so the climax lacks a sharp structural turn. Closure exists but feels somewhat preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: daily return → attempt via utility poles → drift off course → forced to confront the compass → reframed understanding → committed course to the lighthouse. Closure lands clearly with her reaching the lighthouse and reconciling, at least in part, with the sea and her vocation. The drive is primarily causal with a strong internal component, and the cost (continuing to live with guilt while re-engaging her calling) is legible. Escalation is more contemplative than tense, which slightly softens structural impact at this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: procedure → newspaper clues → lake → tunnels → second newspaper → choice to submerge. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with one deepening turn when the second newspaper reframes the quest and pushes him toward immersion. Closure is on-page and decisive—he releases the baseball and accepts the cold as the price of reclaiming empathy. The possible literal/figurative ambiguity of his death is intentional rather than confusing, and costs are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: phoenix alters world rules → fortune frames the choice → ritual and spices → transformation → Shadowpaw’s partial return. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when and the rules of the orchard) and the story stays in a single, legible scene. Closure lands as a clear reconfiguration: she sacrifices fixed humanity to maintain the bond, and the final image makes a before/after meaningful. The cost of that choice is implied more than dramatized, which keeps the structure strong but not quite top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric mode: ascent → ritual preparation → unfastening seals → vision of lost time → conceptual realization. Orientation is clear early (who she is, where she is, what she wants), and the magical logic, while impressionistic, stays internally consistent. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—lost time’s nature redefined—with visible cost in her acceptance that the past cannot be recovered. The only limit is that external obstacles are minimal, so progression leans heavily on interior realization rather than compounded complications.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean: we know quickly who Elara is, where she is, and what she’s doing, and the story maintains a causal throughline from searching the archives to opening the portal. The structure is linear and coherent with one main escalation sequence (the stitching), and closure lands via her successful opening of the dimension and decision to stay. Cost is present but somewhat abstract, centred on sacrifice of personal escape and emotional burden rather than dramatized consequences in the present. This reads as fully functional and satisfying, but not structurally daring or deeply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: beach walk → dropped bottle → escaped firefly → fissure → relic box → realization → departure. The piece delivers a quiet but coherent closure via his conceptual shift about transformation, though the cost of that shift is understated. The “orchestrates coincidences/fulfilling prophecies accidentally” frame is asserted more than dramatized, so the prophecy/coincidence mechanics never quite deepen the structure. Still, for a lyric-leaning causal piece, the throughline holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain (blackout → sundial discovery → secret passage → engineers’ reveal) is clean and easy to follow, with clear orientation in time, place, and POV. Closure lands via a decisive change—Elena aligns with the revolutionaries—though the cost of that turn is only lightly sketched. Some set-ups resolve a bit too conveniently, particularly the quill/sundial mechanic and the engineers’ tidy exposition at the end. Still, the piece reads as a coherent, causal single-scene arc with no major structural breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: preparation on the bluff → precise stone placement → activation of the pattern → crisis of impending destabilization → choice to act as conductor → repriced understanding and aftermath. The prior failed attempt and the collapsing bluff neatly backstop stakes and make tonight’s success and risk legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: she understands friction’s new form and partially restores agency, at real (if mostly implied) personal cost. Structure is linear, coherent, and scaled well to the length, though the cost of her intervention could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous vigil in the observatory moves from waiting, to opening the envelope, to deciding to descend. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: timer → vigil → opening poem → vigil ends → stance crystallizes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where his role and the poem’s function reprice what came before, though the concrete cost of defiance remains more implied than dramatized. No major orientation or lens issues, but stakes stay conceptual rather than being tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clear single-scene arc: preparation → Lyra’s arrival → verbal duel → shared understanding. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sundial/needle pattern and verbal sparring build toward a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Yet the closure’s cost is soft: nothing significant is foreclosed or lost, and the “shift in the balance of power in their academy of thought” is gestured at but never concretized. Structure is coherent but the ending feels more like a graceful diminuendo than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is coherent and mostly linear, with a clear throughline from meeting Maya to expanding resistance to facing a threat from authorities. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal beats plus accumulative textual build), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’ role solidifies from drifter to architect of resistance. However, key turns—especially the authorities’ threat and the mobilization of the underground network—are summarized rather than dramatized, muting the felt cost of closure. The result is satisfying but a bit soft and expository at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: departure from the station → secret staircase → arbor experiment → altered clock → return, with clear causal links. The closure (clock repaired, his stance toward fate softened) is on the page and legible as a before/after shift. The drive lens reads primarily causal, with some lyric accumulation, and it holds without contradiction. The main limitation is that the plan unfolds almost too smoothly, with little sense of what could go wrong or what failure would concretely mean beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is solid: elders’ memory sickness → need to awaken the seed before monsoon → dream ritual → naming the flaw → seed activation and secured memories. The structure is cleanly single-scene with an embedded dream quest that escalates from starlight net to roaring faces to void, and closure lands with an on-page decisive change plus conceptual repricing. Cost is mostly conceptual (risk of failure, cultural loss) rather than dramatized as a near-miss or partial loss, keeping the arc slightly comfortable. Still, orientation is excellent and the drive lens holds clearly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: a single day on the islet tracks from morning intent to evening reorientation, with bonsai work and the lace/compass practice tightening into the closing image. The ghost compass and lace instructions provide a causal spine for how he engages memory and reaches his stance shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the compass no longer points toward Aiko but toward an open horizon, foreclosing the fantasy of repair while opening a new path. Stakes and cost are subtle yet legible, with no orientation or causality breaks.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a vignette or ritual description rather than a story with a causal drive; it lacks a distinct inciting incident or rising action within the scene window. The ending is a stated philosophical conclusion ("peace") rather than a structural closure with a paid price. The "cost" (aching knees) is incidental, not a result of a hard narrative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe causality break occurs when natural frost patterns illegibly match a smuggler's code to function as a map; this unearned coincidence drives the plot. While the closure (reconfiguring the art) is valid, the investigative path relies on magical fiat in a non-magical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a low-stakes linear path: attempt $\rightarrow$ immediate success $\rightarrow$ resolution. There is no legible cost or trade-off; the ending ("given it a new song") is a "Symmetric Satisfaction" that resolves the problem without sacrifice. The causality is soft, relying on a convenient technological breakthrough that works perfectly on the first detailed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies heavily on synopsis-style pacing, condensing weeks of action ("Six weeks... later") into expository bridges that diffuse tension. This violates the short-story scope by offering an outline of events rather than a pressurized, continuous scene, preventing visceral engagement with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or summary of months rather than a dramatized story; it lacks a specific scene anchor (Who, Where, When) and relies on "and then" sequencing without a distinct, on-page climax or causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without opposition; Elias decides to perform magic, and it works perfectly on the first attempt without complication. The closure relies on a "magic wand" resolution where the tear solves the problem instantly, lacking the requisite Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear Decisive Change at the climax that severs ties to the past. Causality holds firm; the protagonist's action directly dismantles the setting and resolves the conflict, satisfying the closure requirement with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ticking clock provides a clear drive, but the causal logic of the climax is weak. The notion that the wall collapsing necessitates a "mirror" reversal of the code feels like arbitrary puzzle logic rather than organic cause and effect. Additionally, the transition where the chains become "suddenly loose" is physically unclear and convenient, resolving a major constraint without earned effort.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is linear and procedural, lacking a decisive turn or complication that threatens the protagonist's goal. While the closure is legible (he captures the sound), the trajectory is flat because success is achieved without a meaningful setback or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression where obstacles (guards) are conveniently neutralized by the setting ("clouded by... glow"). The climax hinges on a sudden interpretive shift ("misunderstood the entire point") that feels unearned by prior causality. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of concrete cost makes the resolution feel tidy and sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.8)
    Closure relies on a significant breach of physical credibility: embedding a leather bookmark into molten glass would instantly incinerate the leather, not preserve it. This scientific impossibility shatters the narrative logic at the critical final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative reads like a synopsis of a longer work, relying on a jarring, unmotivated spatial jump from the library to a laboratory and back. Causality is weak; the resolution depends on magical notes that instantly reverse a betrayal without logical mechanism or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    The pivotal realization (&quot;This discovery had changed everything&quot;) occurs in summarized backstory rather than as an on-page event, robbing the climax of active agency. The ending confirms a stance held weeks ago rather than dramatizing a decisive change or realization in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical object (the violin) that fixes physics instantly. Causality is linear but lacks genuine resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where deep mistrust evaporates simply because the protagonist speaks one line ("I see you"). There is no cost to this resolution; the tension dissolves into tea and comfort without requiring a sacrifice or difficult trade-off. The transition from a setting with a "shattered desk" to a cozy domestic ending breaks causal plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story breaks its own causal logic by shifting from a sci-fi dystopia to high fantasy where marbles teleport and vines create art. The resolution is a Deus Ex Machina that solves the central conflict without character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural outline with no causal obstacles; success is immediate and unearned by tactical adjustment or cost, making the closure feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on extreme conveniences, such as water damage forming a precise musical cipher and a "miraculously" dry podium appearing exactly when needed. The closure creates symmetric satisfaction—the ghost is happy, he is happy—without the required felt or conceptual cost to ground the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.1)
    The central causal link—smudging a drawing leads to specific knowledge of a bureaucratic cover-up—is weak and relies entirely on the magical "oracle" conceit. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the epiphany feels unearned by the on-page action, reading more like divination than narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where a magical object instantly resolves the protagonist's internal struggle without visible cost or complication. The causal link between the tape recording and the valve wheel is asserted by the narrator rather than discovered through tangible narrative logic, resulting in a convenient, unearned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a low-stakes loop (departure, respite, return) that results in a "soft reset" without visible cost or irreversible change. The ending relies on a convenient realization ("renewed understanding") that affirms the status quo rather than reconfiguring it.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the solution (music + eclipse) works instantly without complication. The ending relies on a "weeks later" summary to confirm success, deflating the tension of the scene itself, and the mirror-image locket reveal feels like a convenient coincidence rather than causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "found manual" structure where the protagonist reads a diary that conveniently explains the central metaphysical mystery and provides the solution. The closure—dragons returning—hinges on Aria filing a report (recording the story) without a distinct, dramatized cost or complication, resulting in a soft resolution that lacks causal grip.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear summary of a successful operation rather than a dramatized causal sequence; the crucial "rewriting" happens off-page or in backstory. There is no on-page "Closure" unit as defined by the rubric because there is no Decisive Change or cost—Elias begins and ends in total control. The ending is merely a cessation of activity, not a resolution of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the resolution is achieved through abstract summary ("weight of the priest’s logic") rather than dramatized cause and effect. The victory feels mechanical and inevitable, lacking a decisive turning point with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building successfully to the dawn climax. The closure lands with a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration (the magic fading, returning to reality), though the internal "method" of mapping memories operates on dream logic that slightly distances the reader from the physical cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story follows a functional arc with a valid closure unit (Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing) where the protagonist exits the loop at a cost. However, causality is weak; the climax relies on a sudden realization ("it was a curse") and a convenient flare of the tablet rather than an earned tactical shift. The "procedural generation" mechanics are explained via exposition rather than demonstrated through organic cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path: diagnosis, preparation (grinding the needle), action, and result. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the numbness is not cured but cracked, offering a legible cost and change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is functional, with a clear inciting incident (finding the tube) and a decisive closure (leaving the sanctuary). However, the causality is soft; the protagonist's decision to trust the message relies on a vague "intuition" and a convenient note rather than a compelling pressure that forces the choice. The "tail" introduced early disappears, reducing the immediate causal urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from preparation to execution to realization with clear causality. The closure is distinct and reconfigures the protagonist's understanding, though the pacing of the final epiphany feels slightly rushed compared to the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.3)
    The closure relies on a symbolic gesture that breaks the established causal logic; tying a rope between machines dissolves the binary dilemma rather than resolving it with consequences. By declaring that there is "absolutely no need to choose," the ending evades the necessary narrative cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction where the protagonist wins on all fronts without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the closure relies on a "magic fix" (the sapling instantly growing) that feels like symmetric satisfaction rather than a earned reconfiguration with cost. The causality is driven by the convenient "waking" of the bowl rather than the protagonist's agency overcoming a distinct resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is linear and predictable, resolving via a convenient epiphany that removes conflict without enforcing a felt cost. The climax—deciding to amplify hope—arrives too easily, lacking the friction of a genuine dilemma or a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The resolution hinges on an implausible coincidence (meeting the specific composer connected to the grandmother by chance in a city library) which resolves the arc through luck rather than agency. Tension is deflated by "would later learn" summaries that skip over the actual dramatization of key interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Days blurred into weeks") to bypass the central struggle, violating the immediate scene requirement for short fiction. The resolution is a "soft reset" where an inspirational speech instantly solves the central problem without earning the outcome through causal action or cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined inciting incident (the giant stirring) and a decisive climax. However, the orientation relies on convenient exposition regarding the "Whispering Knot" found in "fragmented texts," which feels like a shortcut to justify the location rather than an organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path from ritual to epiphany without significant causal complications or rising stakes. While the closure is legible as a conceptual reconfiguration, it relies on a "black box" magical solution that solves the protagonist's problem without demanding a tangible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but lacks a decisive turn; the power outage functions as a convenience that lowers difficulty rather than forcing ingenuity. Closure is overly tidy and low-cost, offering a "mission accomplished" stasis without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear Drive Lens (Hybrid Causal/Situational) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The Inciting Incident and Climax are distinct, and the closure (dropping the tablet to embody the leaf) lands with a visible, felt cost (loss of data/protection, physical exposure). The pacing effectively utilizes the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, convenient path where the solution (the stranger) simply waits for the protagonist, removing the need for active problem-solving. The climax relies on an unexplained magical transaction that resolves the central tension without a visible cost or dilemma. The ending is conceptually neat but emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows a linear path of discovery without causal complications or setbacks; the inciting incident (loss of vision) is solved smoothly by the environment. Closure relies on a "happy realization" provided by the pearl, lacking the friction or cost required for a resonant narrative turn. The ending explains the resolution rather than dramatizing the consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing months of action rather than dramatizing a specific scene. The "explain-everything ending" resolves complex trauma neatly without earned causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression where obstacles are resolved by convenient magical shifts (the punch becoming a key) rather than causal agency. The ending relies on a cliché realization ("journey, not the destination") that feels unearned by the preceding events. The closure is a "soft reset" that evades the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal turns or earned reversals; the resolution is achieved through the passive reception of magic rather than protagonist effort. A severe text artifact and loop at the ending disrupt the closure unit, breaking the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and cohesive, following a distinct causal chain from the solar storm's peak to the "spatial mutiny." The closure is a valid Decisive Change (the protagonist's unmaking), and the logic of the magic system holds together within the scene's boundaries. However, the "exit" relies heavily on technobabble (geometry fraying, magnetic fields) that operates on dream logic rather than established tangible constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with valid closure (the successful escape and the handover of the tool). However, the plot lacks a deepening complication; the magical object resolves the central obstacle too conveniently, flattening the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a static procedural vignette lacking a drive lens or causal arc. There is no meaningful tightening of options, and the ending provides "Unearned Stasis"—a reaffirmation of the status quo without visible, felt, or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and backstory (~50%) before engaging the specific scene, which dilutes immediate pressure. The closure ("Earned Stasis") validates the protagonist's method but lacks a visible, felt cost or a decisive shift in options.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where a magical object explicitly points to the answer, removing the burden of logical or emotional problem-solving from the protagonist. The causality is weak; humming triggers a convenient hallucination that delivers the theme statement. Closure creates no felt cost, offering only a symmetric, purely conceptual satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis of a longer work, spanning months and summarizing key events ("Within weeks, her graffiti network stretched") rather than dramatizing a specific moment. The resolution is unearned; the antagonists (developers) simply change their nature upon seeing a performance, dissolving the conflict without cost or logical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality is severely undermined by the "magic item" resolution; the sand grain acting as a precision timing mechanism for chemicals via "unique mineral composition" is technobabble that resolves the central conflict without earned effort. The narrative logic bends to accommodate the prompt objects, resulting in a contrived Deus Ex Machina ending.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative suffers from a severe logic break: a blind protagonist uses visual light refraction to diagnose repairs, undermining the story's physical reality. The plot follows a linear "identify-fix-succeed" path with zero setbacks or causal turns. The deadline (the ship's departure) creates no actual pressure or trade-offs, leading to a resolution without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot hinges on a deus ex machina: the condensation magically forms coordinates at the exact moment needed to solve the puzzle. This lack of causal logic undermines the discovery. The closure is a low-cost logistical decision to leave, lacking a felt price or meaningful reconfiguration of the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of successes with no setbacks, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" rather than earned closure. The ending is a soft reset where the town is fixed without visible cost or trade-off. The progression relies on magical causality ("breathing a note") that solves problems instantly without narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative suffers from a disjointed timeline, notably teleporting the protagonist from a spaceship to an underwater temple with negligible transition. While the closure (integration) is legible, the pacing is mechanical, driven by the insertion of required phrases rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot relies on a *Deus Ex Machina* (the magical lattice) to resolve the central physical conflict, rendering the escape a matter of convenience rather than earned ingenuity. The brevity of the piece forces reliance on summary ("months deciphering") and weakens the causal chain, as the wall yields to "belief" without a dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure relies on a weak causal link at the climax: the botanist’s memory surfaces "unbidden" after touching a tree, rather than resulting from the ghost's specific efforts or a high-stakes choice. The resolution is mechanically tidy but lacks earned narrative weight, as the "debt" is paid without visible sacrifice or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative flows via dream logic, which excuses the spatial shifts, but the climax relies on an unearned magical ability ("sewing air") introduced only at the moment of resolution. Closure is achieved but lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: arrive, dig, succeed. There are no complications or reversals; the "perfect, circular hollow" accepts the object without cost or effort, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" rather than earned closure. The ending explains the resolution ("purpose... became achingly clear") rather than letting it emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking an inciting incident, rising action, or causal linkages. Closure is non-existent; the story ends simply because the task is finished, offering no Decisive Change or cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on an asserted "magic hand" logic where embroidery literally alters political reality without a coherent causal mechanism. The climax is a Deus Ex Machina where the "coup is postponed by a thread" solely because the text says so, lacking earned struggle or intelligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot unfolds as a frictionless linear sequence where the environment and magic system facilitate the goal without obstacle. Closure is achieved through a "magic button" resolution that restores balance without the required visible or felt cost, resulting in a convenient, symmetric ending.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where anxiety simply dissolves into solace without a visible cost or hard choice paid on the page. The "ghost child" ending dissolves the scene's tension through disappearance rather than consequence, weakening the causal chain. The decryption of the notes is a poetic conceit that bypasses narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural path: arrival, ritual, success, and departure. The mention of a "gamble" is not supported by the plot, as the magic works immediately without complication. The closure acts as symmetric satisfaction, resolving the premise neatly without unforeseen cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a "tour" structure where the protagonist observes wonders without causal engagement or consequence. The closure offers a "soft reset" (a change in perspective) without the required visible or felt cost; the "exchange" mentioned in the text is given freely, devoid of narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.2)
    The structure violates the short-story scope, reading as a synopsis with three distinct time jumps ("Weeks later," "One evening," "Next morning") that dilute tension. The resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina (a wildflower blooming overnight with complex symbols etched on it) that breaks the established physical reality without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.0)
    Closure relies on external magic (the blossom simply dissolves pain) and a deus ex machina (a new postcard with instructions), bypassing character agency. Causality is absent; the protagonist waits for a destined event rather than earning a change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect structure, moving from the broken chime to the repair and its cost. However, the transition from fixing the chime (echo) to fixing the locket (memory thread) feels slightly convenient, and the "light the way" beat is metaphorical rather than a concrete causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" structure where the protagonist performs a ritual that solves the conflict externally; the arrival of the partner is a convenient coincidence timed to the spell's completion. The stakes (paths diverging) remain metaphorical and vague until the very end, and the "shattering" of the ink well is a spectacle-cost rather than a narrative turn that alters options. Closure is achieved through magical intervention rather than the "unsnarling" of actual human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is driven by magical convenience (a portable analyzer extracting full poetic sentences from dried glue) and a reality-breaking scale error (77 cubic meters is a pond, not a floodgate capacity for a town). The resolution hinges on a numeric coincidence rather than logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from preparation to release with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The Situational lens holds, though the internal stakes rely heavily on stated significance rather than demonstrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on asserted connections ("intuit") rather than dramatized causality; the link between weather codes and wood grain is abstract and opaque. While the ending offers a conceptual reordering (staying as guardian), the lack of active struggle makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-cost rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is severely strained; the leap from a "burnt feather" to discovering a complex celestial observatory mechanism relies on "weaving theories" rather than legible logical steps. The detail of the feather being "still warm" after years breaks physical plausibility without narrative justification. Closure is weak because the protagonist faces no resistance; the ending arrives via a timeline accumulation rather than a decisive, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality relies on coincidence; the critical "dark seeds" simply roll in from outside without explanation to solve the puzzle. Closure is soft, leading to a pause in action ("until next season") rather than a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot is a linear execution of a plan that faces no obstacles, resulting in a "and then" sequence rather than causal pressure. The connection between the bishop and the subsequent events (violinist, juggler) is asserted as "orchestrated" but feels arbitrary on the page. Closure is achieved through a mechanical success (fixing the clock) that imposes no visible or felt cost on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path (preparation → dance → success) without meaningful reversals or complications. While the closure (transformation) is logically consistent, it arrives without generating causal friction; the magic simply works as intended. Orientation is adequate, but the plot lacks a pivot point that changes the character's options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of observations without causal friction or a decisive turning point. Closure fails the rubric's requirement for a "visible or felt cost"; the ending is a "mission accomplished" moment where the character leaves satisfied, lacking any reweighting of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence: arrival, reflection, and immediate resolution without an escalating test. The closure—a "soft reset" where Elias simply decides to reframe his trauma—lacks causal cost or earned difficulty; the realization feels handed down by the narrator rather than forged by the scene. The "therapist had suggested it" motivation renders the inciting incident external and dutiful rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot relies on magical validation (the gauge moves because she thinks thoughts) rather than causal agency. The "soft reset" ending lacks closure cost; she simply receives an answer and leaves, rendering the "trial" without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies heavily on convenient backstory (finding the diaries "yesterday") to propel the character, rather than immediate causal triggers. The climax is passive—a vision triggered by mere touch—and the resolution hinges on an internal epiphany that reframes the stakes without external action. The "miraculously legible" clue finding feels contrived, bypassing the need for problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear task completion without a decisive turning point or on-page cost. While the girl seeing the reflection offers a conceptual closing image, it lacks a causal link to a difficult choice made by the protagonist in the scene, resulting in a low-stakes vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence—arrive, reflect, perform ritual, feel better—without a causal turn or distinct obstacle. The ending ("golden light that felt like absolution") offers a "soft reset" resolution where the emotional cost is declared resolved by the setting rather than earned through a decisive action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure functions as a ritualistic scene, but the "bio-resonant technology" acts as an unearned magic wand to resolve the plot. The conclusion relies on the pathetic fallacy of rain arriving exactly at the moment of release, which feels convenient rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The structure relies on a linear sequence of magical interactions without causal friction or genuine obstacles. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where all tension dissolves into "wholeness" without a legible, felt cost or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary and montage ("Weeks passed," "He would reverse"), violating the short-story scope of a continuous scene or focused shard sequence. This synopsis-like approach prevents causal pressure from accumulating. The ending introduces an unearned genre break—puppets literally moving independently—which reads as a magical realism deus ex machina in a story previously grounded in the gritty reality of a "seedy bar."

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritual arc (building the structure), but the closure relies heavily on explanatory summary ("His motivation was fulfilled... not in preservation, but in the act of honoring") rather than dramatized release. The linear progression lacks a true turning point where the outcome is in doubt; the "climax" is merely the cessation of labor, resolved by authorial assertion of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative suffers from "symmetric satisfaction," where the ritual succeeds perfectly with no unintended consequences or sacrifices. The drive lens is nominally causal, but the execution lacks resistance; the protagonist encounters no significant obstacles beyond a brittle rope, making the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.7)
    The causal chain is coherent, but the climax relies on a low-resistance mechanism (fixing hardware via a dreamscape thought) that feels disconnected from the physical stakes. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (accepting his nature), but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path with low causality; Elias waits, the star aligns, and he succeeds without complication. The ending offers a "soft" resolution where the covenant is sealed without a visible, felt cost or a decisive change in the character's status.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The structure is repetitive and episodic (Leo visits, Maya visits, three others visit) without escalating stakes or complexity. The plot relies on a magic-bullet solution where the music box resolves all conflict instantly, bypassing the need for causal progression or earned change. The ending summarizes an internal transformation for Elias ("healed parts of himself") that was never dramatized or set up in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic wand" causality ("quantum alchemy Elian didn't understand") that solves the central problem without established mechanics or effort. While the shift from "capture" to "home" offers a conceptual resolution, it lands without a visible or felt cost, making the closure feel unearned and automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The scene is coherent and structurally complete, but lacks causal turns; it reads as a linear ritual without sufficient resistance to generate narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story functions as a synopsis covering weeks of time ("Weeks blurred," "Margaret started documenting") rather than a dramatized short story. This violates the scope default of a continuous scene or mosaic, resulting in a loss of immediate pressure and orientation. The narrative "tells" the breakthroughs rather than showing the causal events that trigger them.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Days blurred into a routine") to bypass the dramatization of the central struggle, effectively deflating tension. While the conceptual turn regarding the diary is clever, the resolution arrives via intellectual assertion rather than a causally earned breakthrough within a continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path where obstacles are overcome by a magical tool without tactical difficulty or cost. The closure—becoming "whole"—contradicts the premise of a sacrifice; the "cost" is stated but the result is purely beneficial, stripping the ending of genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance with a "fix-it" resolution that relies on the coincidence of the seal matching the rope. The closure is a restoration of the status quo without a felt price, as the "hard-won" clarity is asserted in summary rather than demonstrated through a difficult trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without obstacles; Lorne seeks the spot, finds it immediately, and succeeds without resistance. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved exactly as planned with no complication or cost. The energy beings are passive set-dressing rather than active antagonists driving a plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the protagonist faces a mechanical problem and solves it using a convenient power ("retrocognitive blessing") and a magical object ("shard of hush") without setback. Closure is achieved without visible or felt cost; the success is total and unblemished, which deflates narrative tension. The logic relies on magical fiat rather than causal progression or earned ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central epiphany—that shadows match the fog's "timeline"—is logically opaque and does not causally earn the conclusion that memory resides in the air. Closure is asserted ("he knew he had succeeded") rather than dramatized through a specific turning point, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear lock-and-key progression with no causality gaps, but the closure relies on an "explain-everything" message found on a wall. The resolution is unearned by present action, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The situational lens holds well, using the pause in conversation as a container for the narrative arc. Closure lands clearly with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence into acceptance. The pacing is effective for a vignette, though the "micro-turn" is subtle, relying heavily on the metaphorical weight of the cicada rather than a shift in event causality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear accumulative structure and a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure ("bunker walls no longer felt like a cage"). The orientation and transition to the trellis are handled efficiently, though the middle lacks causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without a causal turn or meaningful obstacle; the "problem" (an echo) is solved immediately by placing a magical object, which works perfectly. The ending loops through multiple restatements of resolution ("work was done," "vial was still") without a distinct closure event or price paid. The lack of tension makes the arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    The causal chain is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) is distinct. However, the inciting obstacles are resolved too conveniently (the flake instantly disabling guards), and the ending relies on summary explanation ("hidden journals") rather than the immediate power of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from a stable state of isolation to a Decisive Change triggered by the failing threshold. The closure is distinct and on the page, with a clear trade-off (safety for connection). The causality is tight, though the mechanism of "linking through scars" is summarized in backstory before being deployed as the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear wish-fulfillment path where a magical ritual resolves the central tension without visible or felt cost, violating the requirement for valid literary closure. Causality is replaced by "magic logic," where the outcome is guaranteed by the premise rather than earned through narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is linear and procedural: he operates a machine, receives a vision, and leaves. While a Conceptual Repricing (the dynasty is a prison) occurs, it arrives without meaningful obstacles or the risk of failure. The "clattering handle" offers only token physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a low-tension procedural path where the protagonist finds a map, follows it, and fixes the world without obstacle. The climax is a mechanical interaction ("unsnap the gear") that resolves all stakes instantly, creating symmetric satisfaction without a complication or causal twist. The lack of resistance from the environment flattens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path without significant causal turns or complications. While the closure (uniting the button and drawing) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of obstacles or paid cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is complete, with a clear inciting incident and climax. However, the causality strains credibility—specifically the "puddle map" mechanism which functions via unexplained logic—and the resolution where Maya simply plans to return to work undermines the magnitude of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational/Ritual lens, and the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible as he successfully delays the prophecy. The cause-and-effect of the music disrupting the light/pattern is established well, though the climax resolves somewhat procedurally.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience and "magic bullet" causality, where prodding a speck immediately resolves the central mystery without complication. The ending is an "explain-everything" conclusion where the protagonist simply realizes the truth because the magic explicitly shows it to him. The repetition of folklore phrases acts as a scaffold rather than an organic plot driver.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory: observation, descent, epiphany, exit. The closure acts as a conceptual shift, but because the "cost" of the journey is purely physical and minor (steep stairs), the change in worldview feels unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative arc suffers from a significant causality gap: the leap from a failed search party (immediate, acute crisis) to a serene, symbolic ritual of closure (long-term processing) breaks emotional verisimilitude. The ending relies on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the coin is mended, but the stakes of the missing partner are dissolved by a convenient shift to metaphor ("names were compasses") rather than addressed. The plot serves the prompt's required philosophical outcome at the expense of the setup's inherent urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, episodic structure (walk, heal, heal, end) lacking causal tension or escalation. The healing process meets no resistance; success is immediate upon applying the method, rendering the outcome inevitable. The closure—burying the tooth—feels arbitrary rather than a necessary consequence of the preceding events, and the "cost" is merely described ("tightened with a luminous ache") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the resolution relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" where a complex trauma is neatly solved by a mathematical formula. This acts as a soft reset, dissolving the tension without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult, irreversible choice that carries lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on dream logic where "intuition" solves all problems without causality or setbacks. The ending—a soft reset to the study—undercuts the reality of the market, reducing the narrative to a low-stakes vision. Orientation is intentionally vague ("not in space but in time") but lacks the concrete grounding required to make the magic feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (detect, engage, resolve) with clear orientation, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" anti-pattern. The "sphere of force" and subsequent lifting of sorrow provide a tidy, symmetric satisfaction that resolves the conflict without extracting a visible price or requiring a difficult trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid with a clear Decisive Change at the end (the jump/abandoning the role). The dream-logic causality holds together well, and the rupture provides distinct closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (theft) functions as a decisive change, but the climax lacks friction; the ritual works instantly and the theft meets no resistance, lowering the sense of earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path lacking meaningful reversals or causal complications. The resolution relies on a "magic key" logic where the protagonist applies inventory items (stone, filaments) to instantly solve the problem, creating a sense of inevitability rather than earned success.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural trajectory, deepening the mystery until the final Conceptual Repricing closure. The transition from the lab to the lagoon is swift but causally linked by the compass. The closure—leaving the tool behind to accept the mystery—lands with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a video-game logic (find slide, visit markers, insert key, stop storm) rather than literary causality. The resolution is a "Magic Key" fix where the environment simply resets without requiring a sacrifice or meaningful internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece functions as a synopsis of a year-long arc rather than a short story, violating the single-scene/two-shard scope default for this length. The narrative drifts through seasons ("spring softened," "by autumn," "winter's first snowflakes") without anchoring a specific scene, diffusing all causal tension into generalities.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on dream-logic convenience where specific actions (arranging debris) yield immediate supernatural cooperation without escalation or failure. The "retrocognitive trap" functions as a magic spell rather than a causal constraint, and the closure—filing a diary note—feels bureaucratic and disconnected from the "searing" experience just described.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict (art vs. sustenance) is resolved by a "have it all" choice ("balance") that deflates tension rather than forcing a trade-off. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the magic complies instantly, lacking a Decisive Change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, but the causality relies on a convenient information dump ("The prophecy revealed itself...") to explain the stakes. This summarizes complex lore rather than letting it emerge through action, weakening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with a "soft reset" ending that resolves the conflict without a legible cost. The solution (recalibrating the inheritance) is a net gain achieved through a magic ritual, lacking a decisive trade-off or consequence. Causality is driven by ability convenience rather than hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with low stakes; the "zero hour" is merely a test, and the conflict is resolved effortlessly by switching systems. Closure is a "satisfied nod" indicating total success with no visible cost or sacrifice, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.4)
    The piece fails to dramatize a scene, relying instead on broad summary ("Years passed," "seventh decade") that diffuses all tension. There is no specific inciting incident or rising action in the present moment, only a chronicled timeline of events without immediate causal force.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot follows a simple problem-solution track with no complications; the resolution relies on a "magic thought" mechanic ("speaking... with intention") that dissolves the threat instantly. The ending restores stasis without an earned sense of reconfiguration or price paid, lacking the causal density required for a satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality fractures significantly when the protagonist leaps from holding a cracked urn to realizing the solution involves garage sale descriptions; this connection is a non-sequitur that breaks the narrative chain. The world logic is inconsistent: the premise establishes that "numbers changed meaning," yet the climax relies on standard numerical coordinates to locate the journal. Closure arrives via a "deus ex machina" journal that explains the plot in summary rather than through dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on the convenient coincidence of the kite string to resolve the abstract goal, lacking causal pressure. Closure lands on a safe realization without a visible or felt cost; the object's abandonment feels pre-planned rather than a sacrificial decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story violates the single-scene scope default, relying on a montage that spans months ("Three months into his sentence," "In his final days") rather than a dramatized scene. This summary mode flattens causality and prevents a distinct closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a Decisive Change, but the resolution relies on a "magic key" mechanic rather than protagonist agency. The causal link between the "chemistry of homecoming" and the character's sudden belief is asserted rather than shown through a logical or emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression (arrive, plant, leave) without a decisive change or felt cost. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a magical solution that resolves the premise without sacrifice or complication. This "soft reset" approach lacks the necessary friction to generate narrative drive or earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence: Elias happens to be holding the exact "key" (leaf) needed for the cylinder found two weeks prior. The ending acts as a prologue ("Tomorrow, he would stand...") rather than a resolved unit with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and structurally sound, with a defined inciting incident (the glimpse) and a legible closure (the decision to map). The orientation is stable. However, the epiphany is delivered through summary ("The insight struck him...") rather than emerging organically from the action, slightly distancing the reader from the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality is driven by dream logic; the link between the chess trade and the sky repairing itself is arbitrary and unearned. A significant continuity error occurs with the "pocket sundial lid," which shifts from a skylight feature to a handheld table object without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear walk-through of a theme with no causal turns or rising pressure. The closure relies on a stated conceptual repricing ("void" becomes "invitation") that feels unearned because no cost is paid and no alternative path is foreclosed. The plot lacks a distinct inciting incident or climax.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing weeks of experimentation ("ensuing nights," "weeks of practice") in a montage, which flattens the dramatic tension. The central turning point—mastering the language—is a low-agency epiphany triggered instantly by touching the objects, lacking causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, fulfilling the quest structure, but relies on a "magic key" resolution where the setting simply dissolves upon success. The closure is legible (redemption achieved), but the lack of complications or twists makes the progression feel rote. The causal link between the chess move and the labyrinth's destruction is symbolic rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central mystery is resolved by a disembodied voice explicitly stating the plot logic ("Forgiveness costs truth"), which shortcuts the investigative causality and tension. The climax lacks mechanical resistance; the spire crumbles simply because the protagonist recites poetry, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned through distinct tactical shifts or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the climax relies on a soft reset: the key ring charm magically absorbs the acidic danger, removing the threat without cost or ingenuity. The ending lands on a realization, but the lack of a paid price for the magic makes the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot relies on a significant convenience: a "wrong turn" leading to a magical cave in a location the protagonist has visited for decades strains credibility. While the closure (destroying the painting) lands with a legible cost, the causal path leading to it is driven by coincidence rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, adhering to a clear "Hybrid" lens of magical realism where intent drives causality. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the release of the cork/sorrow). However, the progression is a straight line without a "micro turn" or complication to ratchet tension before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear drive lens (Accumulative/Situational) leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The renunciation of the phone call effectively creates closure, though the physical logic of the "reverse migration" remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal: the stranger’s arrival forces a clear crisis that leads directly to the use of the eye. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, with the forgotten truffle serving as a concrete cost for the psychological safety obtained.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is linear and low-friction; the "investigation" consists of receiving a psychic vision and verifying it in a logbook, lacking deductive difficulty or dead ends. Closure is achieved through a new ritual (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.7)
    The plot relies on a chain of conveniences: the chip glows, the ants know the way, the door opens, and the map provides a bespoke epiphany. There is no struggle or failure, only a linear progression of successful actions. The causality is purely magical fiat, lacking the friction required for a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.7)
    The plot moves linearly but suffers from logistical logic gaps; the seneschal appears ahead of the queen despite her riding a horse and concealing her destination, and she continues on foot through "impassable" terrain, a contradiction in terms. The climax relies on convenient memory restoration that solves the problem for the protagonist, reducing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a magical act without significant complication or reversal. The central inciting element (the secret) remains an abstract void that the reader cannot access, making the stakes theoretical. Closure is achieved through a soft-magic success, but the cost (dimming light) feels transactional rather than narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story functions as a static vignette with low causal density; the protagonist's shift from bitterness to acceptance occurs as a "soft reset" without an inciting trigger or complication in the scene. The brevity (~450 words) prevents the necessary structural development for the required closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story lacks a valid closure unit with felt cost; the ending is a net-positive restoration of ability (smell returns) and emotion (calm returns) without a sacrifice. The "soft reset" of the protagonist's core constraint dissolves the conflict rather than resolving it through agency, resulting in a tidy, unearned "happy ending."

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the "held breath" of the storm, creating a natural pacing mechanism that aligns with the internal tension. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the "crystallized scar" serves as a permanent, on-page marker of the change, satisfying the causality established by the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path (setup, execution, success) with no complications or setbacks to test the protagonist's resolve. While the closure is legible, the lack of causal friction makes the resolution feel automatic rather than earned by the specific actions taken.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear ritual progression from entry to transformation, maintaining a consistent dream logic. While the closure (merging with the book) functions as a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of causal obstacles makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned. The "universe's hiccup" serves as vague backstory rather than an active pressure on the narrative present.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent with a clear inciting measurement and a conceptual closure (realization). However, the causal mechanism—counting backwards causing water to physically stutter—reads as a convenient magical-realist device without sufficient grounding, making the epiphany feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative lacks causal pressure or resistance; the protagonist moves from observation to total ideological alignment without a single obstacle or meaningful reversal. The resolution relies on an unearned "soft reset" where complex professional duties are abandoned for a vague philosophical revolution without any visible cost. Causality dissolves into dream logic, where shared glances replace necessary narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality breaks at the climax; the bridge between reading subway graffiti and overturning a lifetime of rigid logic is fragile and unearned. The ending relies on a "magic words" resolution where the conflict dissolves instantly without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies entirely on iterative summary ("would ring," "always began"), lacking a specific inciting incident or causal chain in a singular timeline. Because there is no dramatized scene, the closure feels like an intellectual assertion rather than an earned resolution to a conflict. The orientation fails to anchor a specific "when."

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story achieves closure with the locket sacrifice (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the causality leading to it is weak; the protagonist acts because "today marks the day" rather than due to mounting immediate pressure. The narrative relies on a summary of a ritual rather than a specific, urgent crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist trades a physical object for a shift in perspective. The causality of the "rumor chain" is soft, operating on fairy-tale logic, but the transaction provides a functional pivot point for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest lacking obstacles; the forest and notes aid him without resistance. The closure relies on a "soft reset" trope—the destination wasn't real, it was internal all along—which dissolves the stakes without a felt price. The ending explains the resolution rather than enacting a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible reversal (rewriting the rewrite) that functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the anomaly. Causality holds, though the mechanism of the "edit" is surreal; the closure is valid but the cost (loneliness) feels stated rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a causal sequence; the characters begin and end in largely the same state, with "success" declared rather than earned through overcoming resistance. Orientation is clear, but the "symmetric satisfaction" ending—where the goal is achieved exactly as intended without cost or complication—flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing weeks of activity instead of dramatizing a specific scene or shard. Causality is driven by convenient "intuition" that solves puzzles off-page, bypassing the necessary struggle that gives a plot weight and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a decisive turning point; the "experimenters" provide no on-page opposition, resulting in a success-state progression that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist simply applies pre-existing knowledge to succeed without complication. The resolution relies on convenience—the key fits a hidden seam found immediately—and the ending offers a "to be continued" sentiment rather than the required closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: a problem is presented and immediately solved by a magical device without complication or causal setback. Closure rests on an unearned epiphany ("suddenly perceived meanings") that bypasses the necessary work of processing grief. This is a "magic feather" ending where the prop does the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary and routine ("Each afternoon," "Each night") rather than dramatized confrontation; while the logic holds, the closure arrives as a guaranteed success without the protagonist paying a visible or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot is linear and dreamlike, driven by magical invitation rather than character agency; the island appears simply because she swims toward it. Closure is weak because the "detachment" has no visible cost—she returns to her job with a better attitude, making the stakes feel low and the resolution convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is functional, following a clear inciting incident (knock) to resolution (departure). However, the causality of the "performance" strains credibility; the inspector accepting theatrical narration as "contentment" feels convenient and lowers the tension of the test.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist encounters an obstacle (language fails) and immediately overcomes it with a shift in intent, devoid of struggle. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains power without losing anything of value, failing the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The arc is a linear desire-fulfillment path with no meaningful reversal or obstacle; Lyra accepts the trade immediately, stripping the scene of tension. Closure is a physical state change (cured) rather than a reconfiguration of meaning, lacking a felt cost or sacrifice beyond a fair labor exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where an internal realization magically alters physical reality (the room rewriting its history), breaking causal grounding. The closure is achieved through a sudden, frictionless epiphany rather than a sequence of pressured choices. The inciting incident is buried in backstory ("pilgrimage had begun months ago").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece fails the fundamental scope requirement of a short story, operating instead as a synopsis or summary of a situation spanning years. There is no continuous scene with immediate causality, escalation, or a closure unit where a cost is paid in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a valid closure unit; the decision to "continue the work" is a resumption of the status quo without cost or decisive change. The narrative arc is purely expositional, with no causal turning point that alters the protagonist's options or knowledge state through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unhindered success: arrival, interaction, victory. There is no causal resistance or reversal; the "danger" mentioned is never dramatized on the page. The ending explains the transformation rather than showing a decisive change in the status quo through action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a low-stakes linear progression where a problem is identified and immediately solved by a magical object without complication. The climax—a sudden "metamorphosis" triggered by the stone—lacks earned causality or resistance, functioning as a convenient fix rather than a narrative turn. There is no felt cost to the resolution; the "regret" is stated but not paid for in the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from artifact review to decision, satisfying the Drive Lens (Causal). Closure is a valid Decisive Change (launching the sanctuary), though the "cost" of this decision feels somewhat intellectualized rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative flow is severely disrupted by non-diegetic text artifacts (code strings and foreign scripts) during the inciting incident. The resolution feels unearned, as the protagonist accepts a lecture from a fern without causal friction or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path to an epiphany with minimal resistance; while the Conceptual Repricing lands, the absence of obstacles makes the resolution feel convenient and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes ritual structure where the protagonist succeeds by following instructions without setback or deviation. The closure ("rest") functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but because the process lacked causal friction or risk, the resolution feels like a procedural outcome rather than a narrative victory.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a task with low causality; the solution (charming the archive) relies on a "realization" backstory rather than an active struggle in the scene. Closure is achieved (seedling takes root), but it lacks a felt cost or a meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    Causality is legible but linear, lacking a "because/therefore" escalation that forces a difficult choice. The closure offers a "success" state without a visible, felt cost on the page (Cost proof test failure), reading as a convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear progression (walk, talk, arrive) with no causal branching or obstacles; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the traveler is gifted a realization without paying a visible price. The closure relies on a magical fix (the pool) rather than a consequence of the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality relies heavily on convenience; a smudge leads immediately to a bolt which implausibly functions as a physical key for a piano lock. This "video game logic"—item A fits lock B—undercuts the narrative's realism. Closure is present (a decision to remain), but the path to the discovery feels mechanically contrived rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a summary montage in the middle ("A scholar... A guard captain") to advance the plot, breaking the immediacy of the scene window and violating the show-don't-tell principle. The climax functions as a *deus ex machina*; the protagonist simply waits and deploys a "master rune" that instantly resolves the conflict without a causal sequence of earned maneuvers or setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.3)
    The climax relies on a causality break where tapping a rusted frame magically causes a digital console to rearrange numbers into a map shape, violating the established technological reality. The resolution is a "magic box" fix that bypasses logical progression or effort.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.6)
    Closure functions as a "Soft Reset" where a magical external force (the stones) resolves the central conflict instantly without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction and an unearned gift rather than a resolution derived from tactical struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient backstory (the kite, plant telepathy) to solve the central problem, removing on-page problem-solving pressure. The climax is mechanical—tracing a script—and lacks a sense of difficulty or risk. Closure is achieved through a "Decisive Change," but the absence of any visible or felt cost makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on summary and loose temporal jumps ("One morning," "Later that afternoon") rather than a continuous high-pressure scene. The central epiphany ("transcendent freeze") arrives conveniently to resolve the conflict without earned causal pressure or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending; repairing a physical box instantly resolves deep psychological trauma ("fragmented reality") without sufficient causal linkage or on-page cost. The pressure point—feeling the walls close in—dissipates immediately upon the decision to act, deflating the narrative tension rather than resolving it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative lacks causal friction; Kael performs an experiment and immediately receives an intellectual answer without obstacle or meaningful cost. The connection between the ink patterns and the psychological realization about time is asserted abstractly rather than demonstrated through narrative logic. The closure is a soft realization that lacks the required "visible or felt cost" to anchor the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails the Closure requirement by relying on an "explain-everything" summary ("The council’s collapse was inevitable now") rather than a specific on-page resolution with cost. The narrative ignores the "blink" timeframe constraint, allowing for a leisurely exit and reflection that breaks causal logic. Resistance is non-existent; the upload succeeds instantly without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece is a static portrait or vignette rather than a narrative with a drive lens; it summarizes a routine ("Each morning," "As evening approached") without a specific inciting incident or causal chain in the present. There is no on-page closure unit because there is no change or reconfiguration of the status quo, only a reaffirmation of a habit. The ending relies on a hypothetical "tomorrow" rather than resolving a tension in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic trajectory (arrival, recognition, action, success) that lacks causal complexity or meaningful resistance. The inciting chaos ("sleepwalking constellations") is immediately neutralized by the protagonist's pre-existing knowledge and skill, rendering the outcome inevitable rather than earned. The closure is a valid "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the lack of obstacles makes the journey feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on significant convenient leaps that undermine causality; creating a murder theory from a bent nib is tenuous, and finding the critical clue taped under the drawer is a worn cliché. The "proof by contradiction" framework is applied, but the immediate discovery of the map removes the necessary struggle or deductive gap.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a massive coincidence (the purchased amber happens to capture his own voice via a "time fold"), which functions as a deus ex machina. This undercuts the causal drive; the protagonist does not solve the problem through wit or sacrifice but is gifted the solution by chance, weakening the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, but causality suffers from "magic button" logic where finding an object solves the central conflict without trial and error. The pivot relies on the protagonist's trait unlocking a physics mystery without established ground rules.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative arc is static; the protagonist performs a symbolic action (placing a tile) that yields an unearned, magical result (the world shifting and ghosts receding). Causality is broken by the "magic fix" ending where renaming a stone instantly heals the environment without logical groundwork or cost. The drive lens is ostensibly accumulative, but the progression feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    The resolution relies on a "magic wand" device (the coin) that solves the central conflict instantly without complication or significant cost. The connection between the performance and the real-world outcome (champagne, renovation plans) is loosely magical rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is strictly linear: problem identified, method devised, method executed, relief obtained. The narrative lacks a causal complication or obstacle during the process; the solution works exactly as planned, resulting in a low-tension arc where the victory feels inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear success sequence that lacks a true inciting crisis or escalating complications; the "fading whispers" are resolved instantly by the method's success. Closure fails the cost requirement: Elara gains power and purpose without paying a visible price or foreclosing an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where mechanical sorting arbitrarily resolves a complex prophecy, lacking Causal or Situational grounding. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" (fate is choice) that feels unearned because it arrives via assertion ("she realized") rather than a dramatized, high-stakes decision or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative logic falters around the central conflict: Elias identifies a "trap" but the story resolves with him making a snow angel and walking away safe, deflating the established threat. The causal link between making the code and "vouchsafing" Althea's future is symbolic and abstract rather than tactical or concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is complete with a legible inciting incident (the promise) and closure (the exchange), but the causality is dream-like rather than mechanical. The connection between the "ticking gutters" and the boat's arrival functions as a declared rule rather than an organic development.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is linear and low-stakes; the resolution ("standing as a kindness") is a soft reset with no visible cost or trade-off, violating the closure requirement for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure dissolves into summary rather than dramatizing a closure beat; the ending summarizes months of success ("Throughout the winter... When spring arrived") without a decisive scene. The resolution is over-tidy, skipping the necessary causal friction or cost required for a literary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure is static, consisting of linear internal reflection without causal progression or external pressure. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply decides to change her outlook, lacking a decisive change in leverage or a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (finds nest, enters art, has epiphany) lacking causal pressure or complication. The closure acts as a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains enlightenment without paying a visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where a complex global phenomenon is fixed instantly by a single unchallenged action. Causality is mechanical—problem identified, button pressed, problem solved—lacking the necessary complications or failures that earn a literary climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, check-box structure where obstacles are overcome by mechanical application of tools rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. The resolution is convenient, relying on abstract "frequencies" to fix reality without a felt cost or causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot is linear and low-stakes, following a ritualistic execution without a causal turn or obstacle. The central inciting find—a silk ribbon surviving ten years of exposure in a wet quarry—strains credibility (physics amnesia) and resolves the "search" too easily, reducing the narrative to a description of the drawing process.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct climax where the protagonist recontextualizes his ancestor's work, achieving a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. While the mechanism of the "dangerous" coordinates stabilizing the storm feels slightly convenient, the structural logic of the "reversible exile" ending lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with significant leaps in logic, particularly the scaffold wrap map discovery which lacks credibility. The ending is a "soft reset" that explains the mystery without exacting a price or enforcing a dramatic change, relying on summary ("Months passed") to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story adopts a summary/montage structure (Track B) to encompass the startup's rise and fall, which dilutes causal urgency and scene-level pressure. While the closure (returning to the train) is logically sound, the middle section ("months passed in a blur") acts as a bridge rather than a pressure cooker, reducing the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the climax; the actual decoding happens off-page ("through the rest of that night... they decoded"). The central realization ("pieces fell into place") is asserted rather than demonstrated through causal logic, and the resolution hinges on the coincidence of the professor's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where magic resolves the internal conflict without significant on-page struggle. The ending acts as a soft reset—the storm vanishes and the protagonist is instantly healed—undercutting the narrative tension. The "failed magic trick" backstory is mentioned but operates as a label rather than a causal driver of the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritual logic, but the climax relies on a sudden, unearned realization ("saw the problem with impossible clarity") to resolve the central tension. The causality is dream-associative rather than driven by pressure, and the cost of the transition is described abstractly ("unraveled") without lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a "magic fix" structure where a ritual solves the protagonist's core problem with no complication or deviation. The ending is an "explain-everything" resolution ("found something better: a balance"), and the cost of the trade is stated ("ache") but immediately negated by the positive outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality breaks significantly when Leo identifies a generic scrap of fabric as the specific one from his past without provenance; this magical knowledge creates a convenient bridge for the plot. The narrative structure is linear and relies on an "explain-everything" realization that resolves the internal conflict without a concrete test or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.9)
    The pivotal climax is elided via summary ("By morning... yielded breakthroughs"), skipping the actual scene of discovery. The closure functions as "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the central tension by effectively erasing the cost of death without requiring a sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette or ritual log rather than a story with a causal arc; there is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive change. The ending offers a return to routine without a legible cost or reconfiguration of stakes, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a magical deus ex machina resolution where the pearl dissolves the central conflict without cost or complication. The "three weeks later" transition elides the necessary causal steps of persuasion and setup, rendering the climax unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is functional, with a clear inciting reflection and a Decisive Change at the climax (throwing the bellows). However, the progression relies on the convenient discovery of "graffiti wisdom" to guide the protagonist, and the connection between the "bad waters" and the decision to forgive is loose. The closure lands mechanically rather than organically.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the narrative arc is coherent, the closure relies on the "it was all internal/mental" trope, which functions as a soft reset rather than a dramatic resolution. The causality is largely mechanical—the watch dictates the pace—and the ending explains the mystery away rather than letting the ambiguity land with narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and leads to a legible Decisive Change where Clementine defects. However, the resolution relies on the artifact's vague magical power to "perforate destiny" rather than a specific, clever application of the protagonist's skills.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural vignette (task start to completion) lacking a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or visible cost. The closure feels like the checking of a box rather than a narrative turn, as the outcome is never in doubt and the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a functional but low-stakes loop (climb, reflect, descend) where the central realization ("contentment is cultivated") arrives without causal pressure or visible cost. The closure affirms the status quo (Earned Stasis) but feels unearned by the immediate scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "client arrives, service performed, client leaves" structure with no causal complications. The resolution relies on a "magical" mechanism (the chimes passing a key) that solves the conflict abstractly, bypassing the need for a dramatized turning point or genuine agency from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the scene tracks a progression, the causality is soft; the leap from observing ripples to physical dematerialization lacks narrative logic or established mechanism. The "delayed revelation" creates a pause but not true narrative tension, and the resolution feels unearned by the minimal effort shown.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story functions well as a meditative shard under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing where the "bars" become "chambers." The transition from observing birds to intuiting specific history relies on a "black box" magical logic that feels convenient, but the closure is structurally sound. The orientation is stable, though the narrative drive is somewhat low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path to success with no causal forks, setbacks, or doubts. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" (he succeeds because he is right) with no visible cost or sacrifice, lacking the required Decisive Change with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without complications; the ritual works perfectly on the first attempt, offering satisfaction without cost. Causality is weakened by the convenience of the journal remaining legible immediately after being removed from its case underwater.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path where the outcome feels inevitable from the start. The climax—realizing her role as a bridge—happens without resistance or complication, resulting in closure that lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, adhering to a single scene with a clear drive (Accumulative/Textural). Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the monsters are left as witnesses. The narrative logic holds, though the inciting discovery is summarized backstory rather than immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Causality tracks within the magical logic, though the pivot from the bell's failure to the viaduct's success feels convenient rather than earned by a hard choice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the specific cost of the victory is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic sequence without causal pressure or meaningful obstacles. The protagonist moves from point A to B performing a checklist of actions; the "signal" of the wind chime falling silent triggers a procedural step rather than a difficult decision or necessary risk.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (observe, act, succeed) without a distinct turning point that imposes a cost. The closure relies on a stated epiphany rather than a dramatized change in the protagonist's status or options; the crystal changes "invisibly," mirroring the lack of visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The situational arc (wait, signal, jump) provides a basic structure, but the causal link between the "scrambled" warning and the decision to jump is tenuous. While the ending offers a Decisive Change in location, the transition relies on "remembered lessons" rather than immediate, pressure-driven necessity, making the resolution feel pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story follows a functional arc with a clear Decisive Change, but the resolution relies on a thematic "power of will" trope rather than hard causality. The mechanism of victory—pouring emotion into a jar to dissolve an enemy—lacks a concrete tactical foundation established earlier in the scene. Closure lands, but the "how" feels structurally soft.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain suffers from a logic gap: Elias resolves to use "orthogonal approaches" but immediately deploys standard, direct tools (loupe, calipers), contradicting his stated plan. The closure (a shift to acceptance) lands as Earned Stasis, but the low cost and lack of genuine on-page testing weaken its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is straightforward and lacks a "micro turn" or complication to test the protagonist's resolve beyond physical exertion. The resolution provides "symmetric satisfaction," granting exactly what was sought without a narrative twist or unintended consequence, making the closure feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the pivot feels unearned because the tension dissolves via a "soft reset" (he remembers his purpose) rather than a costly action. The narrative moves from disturbance to integration smoothly, missing the "felt cost" required for higher bands; the resolution solves the protagonist's problem (the ache becomes a comfort) without a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting realization leading to a decisive action and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The cost—destroying the father's heirloom—is legible and meaningfully reweights the protagonist's relationship to his past.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path with weak causality; the protagonist faces a problem (tuning the signal) and solves it immediately with the object he already possesses, encountering no significant setbacks. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" (realization), but it lacks a felt cost or trade-off, reading as a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where everything clicks into place without sacrifice. The pacing is rushed, with the climax resolving instantly upon the insertion of the fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where a massive cosmic problem is solved instantly by a secret device with no setup or consequence. Causality is weak; the "temporal accelerator" appears as a deus ex machina, and the resolution lacks the required closure cost. The drive lens is nominally causal but relies on technobabble convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear Causal drive: goal, failure, adjustment, and result. The closure—the corridor collapsing—is a distinct Decisive Change that alters the physical space and the protagonist's understanding. However, the pacing is rushed; the pivot from the inciting failure to the resolution occurs too rapidly to build significant narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on symbolic logic over causality, particularly during the climax where the projector "senses" the anchor's composition and integrates it; this reads as convenient magic rather than established technology. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the city's isolation, but the inciting pressure is low.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative suffers from a major causality break: the "music box" appears ex nihilo in the atrium to provide the resolution documents, functioning as a teleporting prop. The ending is an "explain-everything" summary that resolves all ambiguity mechanically without earned struggle. The resolution lacks the required cost or trade-off for a high-quality closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procession of events with no causal tightening or reversals; Eliza simply moves forward until the ending happens to her. The "tidal changes" constraint is mentioned as backstory but does not force a deadline or tactical shift in the scene. The closure (transcendence) feels like a default exit rather than a consequence of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration (finding peace in the infinite). However, the causality is soft; the resolution relies on a dialogue-delivered epiphany rather than a hard-won narrative discovery. The plot functions largely as a vehicle for the thematic statement rather than a pressure cooker for character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success without causal complication or setback; the "curse" provides no actual obstacle. Closure is a realization ("curse was a gift") that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no cost or genuine resistance to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The two-shard structure (garden discovery, then the study at night) works efficiently within the scope. The inciting incident and climax are clear, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the quest from hunt to healing—lands with a distinct physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.3)
    While the linear progression is clear, the climax relies on a soft-magic solution where "beauty" instantly defeats physical threats without established mechanical logic or cost. The resolution is an "explain-everything" ending that tidies up the world-state instantly, bypassing the necessary struggle and consequence that earns a Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight and satisfying; the specific logic of using a manifest discrepancy to manipulate the drone search protocols is a clever, earned resolution. Closure lands clearly, linking the mechanical success to the thematic acceptance of his role.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "Magic Feather" resolution where an external object solves the protagonist's problem instantly with no cost paid. The "wrong turn" is a convenient plot device that removes the need for genuine navigation or problem-solving. Causality is broken by the magical intervention, resulting in a soft reset of the character's capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unearned success with no causal complications; the library bends, she enters, and she returns without obstacle. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the scarf—the only potential physical cost—magically repairs itself ("grew whole again"), stripping the climax of consequence. The closure asserts a change ("the library was different now") rather than dramatizing a shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear "just-so" structure where a ritual solves a global problem without complication, reversal, or earned causality. The resolution relies on authorial fiat ("the dream responded") rather than a logical consequence of the protagonist's agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear diagnosis-treatment-cure structure without a meaningful causal twist or reversal. While the closure (the ribbon losing color) offers a legible conceptual change, the resolution relies on an abstract internal visualization rather than a dramatized external struggle, making the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a sudden intellectual deus ex machina ("method came to her suddenly") and a jarring summary time-jump ("Decades later") that elides the actual moment of integration. The ending dissolves into synopsis rather than dramatizing the closure beat within the scene's timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "button-press" causality: the protagonist decides to act, the ritual works perfectly, and the goal is achieved without complication. Closure brings symmetric satisfaction but lacks a decisive change or felt cost within the scene window; the "cost" (aging) is backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path (ritual to success) with no deviation, reversal, or complication to generate tension. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the character wants to plant the seed and succeeds exactly as planned—without the required Decisive Change or felt cost. The structure resembles a prologue rather than a complete story with narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative progression is functional and linear, but the central secret is revealed through dialogue rather than excavated through dramatic action. The repetition of the grammatically awkward phrase "Across sharing the secret" creates a mechanical seam that disrupts the causal flow.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a convenient linear path where a complex metaphysical problem is solved by a single, successful ritual attempt without setbacks. The causal link between video editing and the physical "meteorite and holy water" ritual is tenuous, relying on "magical recipe" logic rather than established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "rule of three" structure provides a solid scaffold, and the turn at the third transmission is effective. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing, though the link between the sailor's fate and Elias's personal release feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or felt cost at closure. The ending ("task complete") is a symmetrical satisfaction that resolves without consequence or sacrifice. The drive lens is purely accumulative but fails to reweight the stakes, resulting in a flat vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a catastrophic coincidence: Elara brings a contraband diary to a summons by the Master, and the specific decryption tool lies on the elevator floor. The climax (floors 7–10) suffers from severe time dilation, as she reads and processes a lifetime of diary entries in seconds. The "it was a test all along" resolution removes all agency and cost, failing the closure requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is severely compromised by the lack of physical logic; a snapped cable implies a catastrophic fall, yet the gondola "drifts" and "glides" to a gentle landing without explanation. This disconnect destroys the narrative stakes and turns the plot into a dream sequence without grounded rules. The closure is forced and convenient, relying on a miraculous survival that is never earned or explained on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot follows a linear path with convenient progression; the discovery of lenses and the immediate, perfect assembly of a complex optical device lack friction or cost. The timeline is compressed to the point of convenience, and the "hands raw from scraping" line contradicts the earlier action of simply pressing a coin.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative pivots on a massive, unearned coincidence where starlings mimic the board exactly when Elias looks, resolving the plot instantly. The leap from chalk marks to "stranded luminance" is bridged by "realization dawned" rather than causal deduction, resulting in a convenient victory lap without meaningful closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative moves linearly, but the resolution relies on symbolic logic ("magical assembly") rather than causal agency. The closure—a sudden shift to "feeling whole"—lacks the visible price or trade-off required to validate the change in state.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story operates as a synopsis or chronicle spanning years ("For months following," "In the seasons that followed") rather than a dramatized scene. The lack of a specific, grounded timeline prevents the formation of genuine narrative pressure or a closure unit where cost is paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) with the preservation bubble, but the narrative is a linear procession without obstacle or causal tightening. The mechanism relies on abstract assertion ("nested patterns") rather than logical progression, reducing the ending to a fiat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight; the blueprint, nut, and assembly lead directly to the resolution under pressure. Closure lands with a resonant image of entrapment ("frost kisses"), effectively fulfilling the structural requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where a sudden epiphany allows the protagonist to bypass the central dilemma (conscience vs. contract) with a "magic bullet" invention. This outcome lacks causality—river foam does not logically yield a patent loophole—and fails to deliver the required closure cost, as the protagonist gains everything without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a static A-A structure (two nearly identical transactions) with no escalation or decisive turn. The ending relies on stasis without an on-page cost or pressure that would make that acceptance meaningful, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is competent but strictly linear: problem, journey, retrieval, resolution. The "others searching for him" introduces false tension that never materializes or complicates the plot. Closure is achieved through a conceptual reconfiguration of pain, which lands effectively, but the path there lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a summary of a routine success rather than a causal scene; there is no inciting incident or rising action in the present moment. A timeline contradiction exists between the weight's thirty-year service and the project's fifteen-year history, and the "culmination" lacks a specific trigger or on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure ("set up, activate, succeed") with no causal gaps or meaningful resistance to generate momentum. Closure is weak, relying on a summary of future intentions ("She would modify society") rather than a dramatized resolution of the immediate scene. The lack of obstacles turns the plot into a series of successful actions without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest that suffers from "Symmetric Satisfaction"; the protagonist sets out to get an object and retrieves it without complication or cost. Closure is functionally a "mission accomplished" setup for a sequel rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's world or values. The stakes are declared but never tested by failure or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist faces a problem and solves it immediately with no setbacks. The ending fails the closure requirement; it is a soft return to stasis ("motive fulfilled") lacking the necessary Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is static, consisting of a character standing and thinking until he decides to feel better, lacking a decisive change or causal progression. The mechanism of "translating silence" via magnetic fields is abstract and illogical, making the resolution feel like authorial fiat rather than an earned outcome. There is no tangible cost paid for the shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak, conflating metaphor with physics by treating "empathy" as a tunable frequency to solve a physical lock. The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the lock opens simply because the protagonist focuses correctly—lacking a "decisive change" or paid price. The ending is a soft reset where the problem dissolves without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative timeline of waiting without meaningful causal turns or complications that threaten the goal. The closure relies on a "soft" epiphany where understanding is gained without a felt price; the realization reconfigures the premise but lacks the requisite "undeniable conceptual or social cost" to land with impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is linear and relies on convenience—Kael spots the arrow and immediately intuits the planet's history without deductive friction. The closure acts as a prologue ("quest had just begun") rather than a resolved arc with a paid price, lacking the required felt cost for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality breaks under scrutiny; the leap from wind patterns and fuel additives to a specific "biochemical agent targeting human vocalization" relies on "technobabble" logic rather than grounded investigation. The narrative depends on forced prompt phrases ("singular convergence") to bridge logic gaps, and the ending is a realization without an active decision.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear ritual that proceeds without obstruction or deviation, lacking a Decisive Change that alters values or options. The closure ("wonder was... an answer to be lived") acts as a summary of success rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the stakes with visible cost. The "moment" of action is arbitrary, untethered to a genuine time constraint or consequence for failure. Causality is present (singing causes change), but without pressure, it reads as a demonstration rather than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on summary for its climax ("Hours passed as the Keeper walked"), bypassing the concrete scene work required for immediate publishability. While the closure (a shift in perspective) is legible, it feels unearned because the struggle to reach it occurs off-page or in abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina resolution where the press operates automatically and a group of "Solvers" arrives to explain the plot. The ending is an "explain-everything" moment that resolves the mystery through convenience rather than protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary and coincidence; the storm functions solely to force a meeting with a mentor figure who explains the story's thesis. The drive is weak, as the protagonist faces no genuine obstacle that requires ingenuity or sacrifice to overcome. Closure is achieved through a realization delivered in dialogue, lacking a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: intention formed, action taken, validation received. There is no obstacle, reversal, or moment of doubt to test the protagonist's conviction, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a dramatic arc. The ending offers confirmation rather than the required Closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration) with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from isolation to connection, and the closure ("wait") offers a valid moment of Earned Stasis. However, the causality relies heavily on dream logic, and the "rummage sale" discovery feels disorienting within the established ancient/natural atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.3)
    The structure is linear and procedural: he arrives, performs a task without complication, and leaves. There is no causal turn or unexpected deepening; the magic works perfectly on the first attempt, removing narrative tension. While the orientation is clear, the closure—a successful reveal—lacks an on-page cost, relying instead on a backstory payment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot hinges on a deus ex machina: the shard activates "cyclically" at the exact moment required by the narrative. The climax—nudging a probability with a "focused thought"—lacks mechanical or tactical difficulty, making the resolution feel unearned. Causality is driven by the magic object rather than the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, moving from isolation to connection. However, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned; the stakes are low, and the "soft" plot lacks a decisive turning point or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative forms a static vignette rather than a story; it begins and ends in the same routine state without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The causality is circular—he steers the light because that is what he does—and the lack of a closure event with visible cost fails the core requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is functional but relies heavily on coincidence for its climax—the specific alignment of light on the teapot is a luck-based event, not a result of agency under pressure. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it arrives via an "explain-everything" realization that resolves the central mystery too neatly, lacking the felt cost or narrative struggle expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("months," "gradual") to bridge time, violating the short story scope of immediate dramatization. The climax is a reported event rather than a scene driven by causal pressure, reducing the structural tension to a synopsis-like recount.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" progression where the solution (playing music) works instantly without resistance or complication. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where all problems dissolve, lacking a dramatized cost or decisive change in the protagonist's status beyond generic release.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is functional and the closure (crossing the threshold) is legible, but the turning point is driven by ruminative summary rather than active pressure. The substantial backstory block (paragraph 4) slows momentum, though it anchors adequately to the invitation. Causality is soft; she decides because she reflects, not because the situation forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the shared bread re-anchors the protagonist's worldview. However, the resolution relies heavily on the convenient coincidence of the baker waiting in the hedge, which lowers the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, process-driven structure (task start to task finish) with clear orientation. While the closure works as "Earned Stasis" (completing the work as the world ends), the lack of causal branching or meaningful turns results in a flat trajectory where the outcome feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative structure reads like a synopsis or an outline rather than a dramatized story. The use of explicit signposting for the prompt's "false starts" ("The first attempt failed when...", "For her second attempt...") destroys scenic immersion and momentum. The story compresses three distinct events into a summary instead of creating a cohesive scene with rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path from arrival to meeting to realization, but the closure lacks a felt cost or sacrifice. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist faces no meaningful setbacks or hard choices before the "Resonant Reconfiguration" occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is undermined by convenience; the lock is already broken, removing the scene's primary physical obstacle. The resolution acts as a "soft reset," where years of trauma vanish immediately after one sketch, lacking the visible cost or complication required for a passing grade.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("For weeks she committed," "As her messages found") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the short story scope. The inciting discovery—a map conveniently located under her floorboards—lacks causal setup and strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic sequence where the goal is achieved exactly as intended without causal disruption or meaningful complication. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the task is completed—but lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, reading more as an anecdote than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.5)
    Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causal link between magnetic north, the box of fears, and the android's circuitry relies on soft, unearned logic. The solution (miniaturizing fear) feels convenient and invented on the spot to resolve the plot, lacking groundwork in the story's established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Elias spent the day speaking with neighbors") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the "show, don't tell" imperative and flattening tension. The inciting incident—a mailbox physically shaking and groaning—establishes a supernatural expectation that the resolution (a stash of letters) fails to explain logically, creating a broken causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality breaks significantly when the guards, entering to stop an intruder, are conveniently "mesmerized" by her dancing instead of intervening—a "Villain Glitch" that dissolves tension. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the problem is solved completely with no lingering cost or trade-off, and the mechanics of dancing to input code into a connected device remain logically muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience (finding an old key, a method revealing itself in a dream) rather than causal problem-solving. The closure creates "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist retrieves exactly what she sought with no complications, lacking the required felt cost or "Resonant Reconfiguration."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful actions with no complications, orientation loss, or meaningful turns. The resolution is achieved immediately through the summoner's will, lacking the friction or setbacks required for a dramatic arc. Closure is "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem is solved exactly as intended without unexpected consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.3)
    A jarring, undramatized transition ("they were in her study now, though they’d been on the roof moments ago") creates severe orientation debt and reads as a continuity error. The climax arrives via coincidence ("As if on cue"), removing protagonist agency from the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of instructions with no deviation or complication. While the closure (transformation from captive to archivist) is legible, it lacks the required "felt cost" because the magic system explicitly allows her to process memories "without being overwhelmed." The resolution feels unearned because the mechanism removes the burden rather than forcing the protagonist to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path but suffers from convenient plotting; the solicitor's acceptance of a document forged in a basement is assumed rather than tested. The orientation fails the reality check—an aurora visible inside an underground crypt ("undercroft") creates a jarring logical break. The closure is a "Decisive Change" but feels mechanically arrived at.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression from arrival to success without complication or reversal. While the closure (the Spire cracking, the city waking) is legible, it feels unearned due to the lack of obstacles; the "progressive disclosure" is relegated to backstory rather than driving the scene's structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.0)
    The resolution relies on a "God Mode" narrative summary where complex legal accountability is achieved instantly via dream insertion. This breaks causality, as the director's unshakeable certainty and the resulting investigation are unearned by the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: desire, action, immediate success, and validation. There is no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the "cost" of leaving the whisk is negated by the explicit "profound joy," resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative breaks the short-story scope with a tension-killing "two weeks" summary and relies on the convenient discovery of "shredded letters" to explain the plot. The climax consists of reading exposition rather than active engagement or causal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid with a clear Decisive Change closure (leaving the observatory). The climax—altering the frequencies—is handled somewhat retroactively in summary ("had subtly altered"), which slightly deflates the tension of the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative breaks the short story scope by dissolving from a specific scene into a broad summary ("From that day forward," "One evening"), abandoning the immediate dramatic tension for a montage. Closure is achieved through this summary of success rather than a decisive action in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear description of a successful ritual with no deviation, reversal, or unexpected cost. The structure lacks a inciting incident or rising action on the page; the "hostile intent" offers no active resistance, resulting in a plot that feels like a foregone conclusion from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative structure is linear and procedural (wait, map, connect) with a "magic button" resolution that resolves complex societal issues without visible cost. The ending relies on an unearned wave of energy rather than a decisive causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative suffers from a "soft reset" ending; a lifetime of trauma ("controlling influence") is resolved instantly by reading an inscription, with no visible cost or trade-off. The causal link between the cryptic message and the sudden total liberation is weak, relying on an unearned epiphany to force closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal path, but the central logic creates a disconnect: the narrative treats the heart stopping as "killing her again" and a "perfect crime," equating a stopping clock with murder. This hyperbole undermines the gravity of the climax; the mechanical reality (it stops ticking) does not support the declared stakes (murder/desecration), making the resolution feel melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality relies on "magical" logic where an arrow tip in a kaleidoscope arbitrarily reveals a map without mechanical justification. The ending lacks closure, stopping at the threshold of the climax (the descent) rather than resolving the central tension of ringing the bell.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.7)
    The investigation proceeds via summary until the climax, which relies on an "explain-everything" realization: Elias instantly understands a song is a physics key for infinite energy. This unearned leap resolves the plot mechanically without prior setup, breaking causal validity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with low causal friction; the protagonist simply enacts a procedure to solve the problem. The resolution—"Equality"—feels abstract and disconnected from the mechanical action of the mirrors, functioning as a "magic fix" without a legible cost or logical setup. The "weighted breath" framing device does not generate sufficient causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing an accumulative structure that effectively builds to the discovery of the parasol tip. While the closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, the climax relies on a passive observation of others (the singing woman) rather than a decisive action by the protagonist, lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on "soft reset" causality where a prop instantly resolves deep relationship tension without cost or complication. The narrative is linear and predictable, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that feels earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure, and the final image of the discarded mask provides a legible moment of closure and renunciation (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). However, the progression lacks causal density; the "turn" is a simple compliance with a command, and the lack of earlier resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The inciting incident relies on unmotivated fiat ("Today was different... couldn’t say why"), breaking causal logic from the start. The climax—a magical mural projecting itself—happens to the protagonist rather than resulting from a high-stakes decision, lacking necessary narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality is tight and linear; the experiment sequence builds logically to a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist redefines his purpose from decoding to witnessing. The closure lands with a resonant sense of cost—the abandonment of his hypothesis—and the drive lens holds firmly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from orientation to ritual to resolution with a clear drive lens. The closure lands a resonant reconfiguration (sound to chalk lines), though the middle beat relying on the "driftwood" ritual feels slightly disconnected from the "precognitive" hurdle, resolving via a simple sequence rather than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from a fundamental causality break: the protagonist identifies the spinning clock hand as a "symptom" of orbital decay, yet treating this symptom miraculously cures the physical cause. The resolution relies on dream logic that clashes with the story's technical setup, resulting in a Deus Ex Machina ending where physics yields to a convenient mystical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.6)
    The resolution relies on a convenient, low-cost solution (the discovery of the twin record) that dissolves the tension rather than confronting the loss. The "flawless goodbye" is achieved without meaningful obstacles; the nurse's warning creates momentary friction that is immediately bypassed. Causality is linear and predictable, lacking a decisive turn that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal arc is complete and legible, moving from activation to crisis to resolution. However, the mechanism of "closing loops" functions as a convenient magic button that resolves the climax instantly without forcing a difficult tactical trade-off. The pacing is rushed in the middle; the "relearning" process is summarized rather than dramatized, robbing the climax of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "fix-it" structure where the protagonist moves linearly from problem to solution without significant obstacles; the hedge maze, explicitly described as disorienting, is navigated effortlessly by "intuition." The revelation that the corpse was merely an "invitation" retroactively deflates the stakes of the inciting incident. Closure is achieved, but the lack of causal friction makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.7)
    Causality is weak; the transformation of sea glass into a glowing beacon via "polishing" defies physics without establishing a magic system, feeling like a convenient prompt solution. The narrative arc is flat, lacking an inciting incident or meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The meeting hinges on a convenient coincidence (Maya's class trip) rather than causal necessity, which weakens the narrative spine. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the path to it lacks sufficient friction or misinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "collect-a-thon" structure where the protagonist overcomes obstacles with guaranteed success and no setbacks. Closure is achieved through a "magic feather" device (collecting hopes fixes the block) without any visible, felt, or conceptual cost paid by the character. The ending resolves the initial problem too neatly, lacking the necessary trade-off or reconfiguration to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the solution (moon alignment) presents itself without complication or cost. While the sequence is legible, the lack of obstacles or causal friction makes the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that lacks causal friction; the environment actively cooperates ("world held its breath") rather than resisting. The closure is tidy and successful, but feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or meaningful adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure: problem identified, mechanism studied, mechanism fixed, success achieved. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is met without complication or cost, failing the closure requirement for a felt or conceptual price. The "wounded season" provides atmosphere but exerts no causal pressure on the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure—setup, alignment, transformation—without meaningful deviation or unexpected obstacles. While closure is achieved via Earned Stasis (calcification), the lack of causal friction or hard choices turns the plot into a ritual description rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story functions as a coherent vignette under an accumulative lens, tracing the completion of the carving. However, the narrative lacks a distinct turning point or complication; the process proceeds smoothly from start to finish without meaningful deviation or obstacle. Closure is achieved through task completion and thematic assertion rather than a structural shift in the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" epiphany where the protagonist simply decides to change his perspective without external pressure forcing the shift. The mechanism of "collecting fragments" remains vague and metaphorical, failing to function as a concrete causal tool that drives the plot forward.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot operates on dream logic that breaks causality; aligning a sextant with a floor pattern to create "equations of hope" with water lacks mechanical or narrative grounding. The resolution is a "magical fix" where the physical action (opening a valve) produces an abstract, unearned philosophical result.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is functional and legible, moving from avoidance to acceptance. However, the resolution feels unearned; the "sudden clarity" arrives without a decisive turning point or obstacle, resulting in a low-friction, overly tidy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving logically from the sundial's setup to the discovery of the plates. Closure is achieved through a valid Conceptual Repricing of the "lie." However, the lack of complications—the hook finding the target on the first try—makes the plot feel convenient and lowers the sense of earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative proceeds linearly without causal resistance or deviation; the protagonist arrives, succeeds immediately, and leaves, creating a "symmetric satisfaction" arc. The ending lacks a decisive change or felt cost, functioning as a soft reset where a transaction is completed smoothly without testing the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a vignette with no causal drive or meaningful escalation; the protagonist simply sits and writes without obstacle. The ending is procedural (finishing a task) and lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story follows a linear path to a Decisive Change, but the causality relies on magical fiat; a thread cracking an egg causing massive stalactites to snap lacks grounded logic even in fantasy. The inciting incident (finding the egg) is buried in backstory, reducing present-action momentum. Closure is achieved, but the mechanism is arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear vignette of a ritual without a causal turn or decisive change. The closure provides "symmetric satisfaction"—she intends to plant a tree and does so without obstacle or unforeseen consequence. There is no visible or felt cost to the action, resulting in a flat structure that functions more as a prose poem than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure is a linear fetch quest reliant on video-game logic (examine object A to find object B) rather than causal necessity. Closure is achieved through a convenient discovery ("symmetric satisfaction") rather than a decisive change or paid cost, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving clearly from the discovery of the gear to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the garden is permanently altered. The causal logic holds, though the transition from fear to synthesis feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a linear procession of thematic assertions rather than a causal chain; events happen because the theme requires them, not because of character agency. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" realization ("knew he had found what he was looking for") that explains the theme rather than dramatizing a change in the status quo with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a metaphorical logic ("healing the moment") that breaks the established physical reality of the clock mechanism; the resolution is "arcane" rather than causal. Closure arrives via symmetric satisfaction—the clock is fixed, peace is found—without a visible, paid-on-page cost to balance the "perfect, diligent sync."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with no meaningful resistance. The resolution is mechanically efficient ("fingers worked faster"), lacking the visible or felt cost required to elevate the closure beyond a tidy, symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear procession of successful actions without causal resistance or reversals. Closure ("the frozen lake thawed") is a symmetric satisfaction ending that resolves the premise without visible or felt cost. The lack of obstacles turns the plot into a procedural description rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where finding an object (the crystal) and humming instantly solves a global existential crisis ("story famine") without earning it. The plot follows a linear fetch-quest structure (receive instruction -> find item -> win) devoid of causal friction or setbacks. Closure is achieved through deus ex machina rather than character action incurring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual structure, but lacks causal friction; the "incomplete information" setup promises a complication that never materializes, as the process works on the first try. The closure relies on summary ("acceptance of fragility") rather than a dramatized cost or consequence of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis spanning years rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default for this length. Causality is weak; the climax is driven by a coincidental earthquake rather than the protagonist's choices or the pressure of the digging.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure is linear and vignette-like, lacking a decisive turning point where pressure forces a costly choice. The resolution—generations of hatred dissolving through a single rehearsal—feels unearned and lacks causal weight. The ending relies on a thematic summary rather than a dramatized reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story violates the short-form scope by relying on a summary montage ("Days passed," "As the third week began") rather than a dramatized scene, which dilutes urgency and immediacy. While the ending offers a thematic resolution, it lacks a decisive change or felt cost paid on the page; the success feels inevitable and unearned by specific tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The ending breaks the established causal logic; in a setting defined by tech (towers, drones), the box opening magically triggering the street lamp creates an unearned "symmetric satisfaction." The middle section lacks resistance, as the riddle solution is simply possessed rather than solved, reducing the plot to a linear sequence of tasks without reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where options narrow; the protagonist simply executes a known "doctrine" without meaningful obstacles. The closure offers a "perfect victory" with no visible or felt price, failing to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis to a decisive communicative act that reconfigures the relationship between the garden and the surface. The closure is resonant, with the chime serving as a perfect answer to the ampoule. The middle section relies on a rapid "download" of information ("cascade... torrent of revelations") to advance the plot, which feels slightly convenient compared to the earned physical details.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "magic wand" structure where the protagonist applies a tool (proofs) and the obstacle instantly vanishes without complication or cost. The resolution is unearned, relying on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the die and the man are simultaneously healed. The logic of how mathematical proofs physically rupture stone is asserted rather than grounded in the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence, but the causality is weak because the central turn relies on an unexplained magical connection (telepathy via moonlight) that validates the protagonist without obstacle. The closure is a "soft reset"—she feels better because she imagines the other person remembers—which lacks a tangible on-page cost or decisive change in her circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal arc is strong, moving logically from the lens's observation of decay to the ritual act of preservation. The closure lands a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, successfully recategorizing art as "kin" through the physical action of eating the bread, with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a specific, mechanical turning point (lifting the yoyo) that feels earned. The closure is a valid Decisive Change where the protagonist pays the ultimate physical price, satisfying the rubric's requirement for visible cost and reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, instruction-based path ("The advisor urged... So I did"), which weakens causal tension. However, the closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the curse is recontextualized as art, providing a distinct before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative structure is iterative—a description of a routine ritual—lacking a specific causal chain or scene-level tension. The ending offers no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, merely restating the initial condition of "survival makes music" without incurred cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot pivots on a severe causality break: the protagonist serendipitously finds a hidden compartment containing both the exact tool and the instruction manual needed to resolve the conflict. This "convenient finding" functions as a Deus Ex Machina, bypassing the need for genuine trial and error or deductive struggle, and flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak and driven by thematic convenience; the protagonist stops to write notes mid-heist, and the antagonist appears from nowhere only to surrender immediately upon hearing a metaphor. The resolution (victory via thematic speech) lacks earned narrative pressure or logical footing. The "illuminated letter" surviving in a damp, open ruin for decades breaks physical verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, routine structure ("day-in-the-life") where the deadline generates no genuine jeopardy. Closure is a return to the status quo; while the act of placing the note is completed, it lacks a decisive change, sacrifice, or felt cost to mark the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    The causal chain functions linearly, but the pivot relies on a convenient trope (heat-activated coordinates) and a massive logical leap from "preserved paper" to "built underwater." The closure is a Conceptual Repricing of history, but the "blackout" acts as a convenience rather than a pressure, lowering the narrative tension and making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clear Accumulative drive lens, building pressure through ritual until the final placement of the crane. Closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; he accepts the cost of his "luminous torment," locking himself into the cycle with clear conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is valid and effective, marking a decisive shift from passive simulation to active hunting with clear moral cost. The inciting power outage, however, resolves too easily without forcing a difficult choice, serving more as atmospheric delay than a causal trigger for the hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a convenient "explain-everything" ending where a data dump resolves the central mystery without a specific price paid by the protagonist. The "unusual energy field" acts as a plot device to force a reaction, but the resolution—simply pushing past programming—feels unearned. The closure is thematic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scene structure is solid, maintaining a coherent drive from the initial tension to the resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration). The closure—inviting her to the shore—lands clearly, though the dialogue carries a heavy burden of exposition to make the turn work.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot is a linear transaction lacking causal turns or complications; the exchange proceeds exactly as planned. The closure is a thematic realization of relief without the required on-page visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax relies on a break in physical logic—the compass pointing at Elara herself—which functions as a "soft reset" or magical realism element not established by the prior world rules. The resolution is unearned by the preceding struggle; the shift from "drifting" to "renewed purpose" happens instantaneously without a dramatized causal bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, albeit linear, causal chain: the protagonist follows clues, reaches a destination, and performs a decisive action (submerging) with a visible cost (losing the baseball). However, the causality relies on dream logic—the second newspaper appearing on a pedestal acts as a convenient instructional device rather than an organic discovery. The closure is legible as a Decisive Change, but the "labyrinth" aspect is asserted rather than dramatized through complex choices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is functional and the closure (transformation) is a decisive change, but the causality relies on a recipe-like progression of magic events rather than character pressure; the inciting incident (fortune cookie) feels slightly disconnected from the high-fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the ascent to the ritual and finally to the realization, creating a legible arc. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where she accepts the burden, though the impact is slightly softened by the narrator explicitly summarizing the lesson in the final paragraph rather than letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid closure (Earned Stasis), where Elara accepts her role as a guardian. However, the inciting incident (finding the tear) relies on a convenient search, and the central struggle is handled in summary rather than scene, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a literal deus ex machina (the wind and the guided bug) to resolve the central question, breaking causality. There is no inciting incident that forces a choice; the "detour" is accidental, and the resolution is found, not earned. Closure is weak because the "understanding" comes free of charge, with no visible cost or sacrifice paid.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot hinges on a contrivance where a quill holder inexplicably decodes complex messages from a sundial, breaking causality. The closure is a "talking heads" explanation that resolves the central mystery through convenient exposition rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is linear but relies on a "magic key" resolution where an epiphany ("become a living conductor") solves the physical problem without prior setup or trial. The closure brings a Conceptual Repricing of the physics, but the cost ("borrowed dawn," "born anew") is vague and lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The timer functions well as a structural constraint, creating a clear beginning and end to the scene. However, the narrative arc is linear and low-stakes, with the "vigil" simply expiring rather than forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central conflict ("The duel intensified... revealing new truths") rather than dramatizing the mechanics of the change. Closure arrives via a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where understanding is declared rather than earned through causal actions. The plot lacks a drive lens; events happen because the author wills them, not because the characters force them.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure collapses into synopsis, summarizing weeks of development ("For the next month") instead of sustaining a scene. The climax—authorities threatening the library—is resolved in a single sentence of exposition, bypassing all causal pressure and immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear wish-fulfillment sequence where a magical procedure works perfectly on the first attempt without cost or complication. The "symmetry of satisfaction" (broken clock -> fixed clock) lacks narrative tension; the outcome is inevitable from the moment the magic is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: problem, ritual, epiphany, success. The resolution relies on "dream logic" ("clumsiness was the key") which feels arbitrary rather than causal, lacking a sense of earned difficulty. The ending is a "soft reset" where the problem is solved perfectly, avoiding the complexity or trade-offs needed for a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure that coheres, but the causality relies heavily on the convenient, magical behavior of the compass and lace instructions without establishing their rules early. The "instruction manual" nature of the lace removes narrative friction, making the resolution feel procedural rather than dramatic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there lacks causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: final fingertip smudge reweights entire premise—her patient art is both gift and perpetual self-erasure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral patterns layer until the last dust grain reframes stakes. Cost is felt—the priceless medium is literally wiped away—foreclosing limitless repair. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks; escalation is density-rise, not turnover.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: melting the mine’s ash into glass reframes his entire aesthetic as testimony, felt cost on page—“a story of survival etched in glass.” Causal chain holds: fire → ledger → frost pattern → mineshaft truth → aesthetic pivot; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Orientation crystal by word 60 (“quiet canyon under stars”), so no penalty. Persistent constraint—soot of attempted murder—literally becomes medium, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the scanner’s color-cascade reweights silence into “music” with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal, but the lens is taught early and holds. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the first 60 words; no penalty. The final beat—“the scanner flickered one last time”—makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse now rotates without electricity, Marcus accepts perpetual unrest, cost is felt (“chased stillness...slipping away”). Causal chain holds: package → basement failures → impossible-space dive → lens revival → nightly signals. The six-week gap is ellipsed, not broken, because the next scene pays the risk with the underwater retrieval. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Meets 9+ quick test except the cost could be more viscerally embodied, keeping it just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s silence becomes Charged Poise—belonging re-priced without fanfare. Causal chain is intact yet compressed; the “spring in elders’ steps” is told, not shown, blunting the decisive change’s visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the camera is lowered, the upside-down world rights itself, and strangers feel unaccountable mercy—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The drive lens is accumulative/textural; pattern (breath → image → spark) is taught early and deepens once, then pays off in the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Causality is internal and lyrical, not because/therefore, but the piece never promises otherwise. One soft spot: the Kwan-yin tear is introduced mid-scene as already-owned, a minor teleport, but it doesn’t break the closure logic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each looping bridge and dissolving photograph thickens the density of entrapment until the halo tree reweights the stakes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Elias stands in “utterly, beautifully empty” ruin, the cost felt in the burnt palm and erased wife.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (aurora, forge, shipwreck groan) thickens the absences until the forge’s ember re-weights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality is emotional accumulation, not event-chain, climaxing in the audible imprint that crystallizes options—he can now leave with the sound inside the metal. Cost is legible: the forge flares gold, he walks away emptied, hearing aid whistling at silence. Minor hedge: “battered marvel” tag drifts toward explanation, not image, near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    A coherent Causal lens is held throughout: each beat is linked by because/therefore logic (decode flowers → apply moonbeams → silence → smile → renunciation). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s dulling and the woman’s eye-smile reweight the premise—destiny is self, not portrait. Cost is felt in the ache of silence and the jar’s loss of glow; persistent constraint is the now-capped moonbeam tool he must carry forward.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bookmark fused in cooled cobalt glass reweights the premise—safety zone becomes scar. Under Accumulative lens the密度 increases by returning images—icicle drip, steam hiss, glass fracture—each beat re-prices the thaw metaphor. Causality holds: abandonment of vase → teardrop decision → cost sealed in scar. Orientation clean by sentence 3.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: placing the silent shell on the rusted table crystallizes the new stance—vulnerability as weapon—with felt cost (phobia faced, shell abandoned). The causal chain holds: notes → decryption → confrontation → symbolic surrender. However, the betrayal’s origin and mechanism remain off-page, a motivation gap that keeps the Decisive Change slightly hollow; hence low-7.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: the final star’s vanishing flips the premise—darkness is not empty but the necessary condition for perceiving what waits inside it. The cost is felt: the booklet’s soft glow confirms the forfeiture of a star-lit cosmos and Kaelen’s surrender to an unverified threshold. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from documentation to welcome is coherent; tension tightens through reiterated acts of inscription until silence itself becomes the final aperture. One minor scuff: the causal bridge between “concentric circles” hinting at a center and the leap to “gateway” is compressed into a single beat, but the image’s charge still reconfigures meaning at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change: 734 crystallizes from janitor to temporal custodian, the melted violin and broken twilight carrying undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because 734 plays → timelines converge → dawn returns; the “second chance” lie is renounced. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening—music forcing timeline merger—escalates under Causal lens and holds to final image. Persistent constraint: perpetual loop memory only 734 retains, shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: registrar sees doodles → deciphers intent → intervenes → shared silence → tea; the broken-then-unbroken key mirror supplies visible cost, earning a Charged Poise closure; slight late arrival of spiral/key mechanics (-0.3) but pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/texture lens: each marble and vine detail layers until the pattern detonates in the central vine’s luminous map of his life. Causality is emotional, not logistical—care accrued becomes mystical acknowledgment. Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden returns the marbles in a perfect circle, reweighting every prior “small victory” with undeniable reciprocity. Cost is visible in the single line: “he was no longer feeling quite so withered,” a quiet repricing of a lifetime’s depreciation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final hologram transmission crystallizes a Decisive Change—time branches, Elias is vindicated, and the warm nexus becomes the on-page emblem of that new rule-set (Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost). Causality is causal throughout: each lever incrementally widens the breach until perception itself flips. Orientation is crisp inside 60 words (who, viewport, twilight, lab). The only minor drag is the late entrance of “sideways” theory as explicit stakes—until then the motivation read as private obsession; earlier planting would have tightened the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is present: the played melody summons Isabella, reconfiguring the myth (“disrupt the incomplete narrative”) with conceptual cost—the musician now bears custodianship of a ghost’s work. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each ripple reveals notation, each decoded bar intensifies lantern flicker, performance crystallizes the encounter. However, the cipher mechanics are off-stage given; water “creating images” is asserted rather than shown beat-by-beat, blurring the because/therefore chain that would tighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the smudged margins reweight the Edelweiss from purity to testament, making the absence’s gravitational pull legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of smudge → absence → brother’s erased warning—and the cadence shift lands with felt cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored within 60 words. Persistent constraint: the sextant and meteorological charts remain as frozen warnings, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wheel’s opening reweights the whole ghost-shift premise, and the sigh on the tape is the audible cost. Causal chain holds—confession → seek artifact → valve turn → release—taught under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The single-scene orientation is anchored by flashlight-arc within 50 words; no penalty. Minor slip: “spectral factory” is asserted, not demonstrated, but the final image retroactively justifies the rule-set, so lens ambiguity is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds sensory density until the final image of crystallizing obsidian reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—memory-layered reflection—whose cost is the keeper’s continuing, unshared solitude; the price is felt but not sharpened by an on-page trade-off. Transitions among library, swan-fold, and refuge are legible, though the middle third drifts into lyric catalog without tightening the stake. One more beat where silence or reflection forecloses a real option would have pushed this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene under the eclipse clock; causality is lyrical but legible: because Maya plays, therefore Leo taps; because totality arrives, therefore voice returns. The curl-objects teleport once (her locket appears in Leo’s hand without prior transfer), a nit that nicks but doesn’t break the linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise: arms raised toward the ring-of-light reconfigure both their private griefs into shared wonder; cost is the irreversible exposure of their talismans on the grass. Orientation anchor (highest point of Sage Ridge) arrives by line 6; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mosaic shard structure (library excavation → diary decoding → tapestry epiphany) is coherent and causal, each beat because/therefore linked. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the axis is metaphysical, the cost is species-wide imaginative extinction, and Aria’s renunciation of action crystallizes the stakes. A stronger on-page body-cost (fatigue, temporal urgency, or concrete risk) would lift this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine holds: rewrite microdot → mislead pursuers → save agents. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the network will collapse “with a whisper”—and the cost is the eternal anonymity of Elias, tasted in “salt and conspiracy.” However, the decisive turn (microdot hand-off) happens off-stage; we see only the after-glow, not the irrevocable choice beat itself, so the cost is felt obliquely rather than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the anchor stabilizes but the priest exits with silence as a persistent constraint—“the silence followed him.” Causal chain holds: every loop, stroke, and rhetorical question tightens the entity’s options until the final unlooped note fissures its hold. Cost is legible in the final image—“the violet color was gone, but its memory lingered”—a conceptual repricing that reweights his future tactics. Lens (Hybrid→Accumulative) is taught early and held without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal chain is pristine: because he is chronologically homesick, therefore he maps memories onto glass; because each pane is sung, the spire answers; because dawn arrives, the chord crests and depletes him. Orientation anchored by clause 3 (“frozen lake outside”). Closure = Charged Poise: the C-major dawn reweights every prior note, cost is the instant fade of shell-light and his collapse. Persistent constraint—imminent exhaustion—shapes tempo and tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shattered tablet and ordinary street reweight the premise—victory equals mortality. Causal chain holds: each retracing tightens the labyrinth’s grip until the sacrifice of eternity is inevitable. Orientation is taught by the second sentence (viaduct, post-rain, neon reflection) and the experimental loop pattern is signaled early; the final image pays off the disorientation. Cost is visible in the extinguished glow and the plain rain, but the beat is slightly under-written; a sensory shard of what eternity felt like now gone would push it to 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the filament snaps, the cavern stays muted, yet Elara’s stance is re-weighted—“messy, painful throb of existence” is the conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile vibration layers density until the pattern break (needle rasp → internal crack) re-tunes stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt. The persistent constraint—deafness—shapes every tactic and is re-priced in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: found-tube → decryption → choice to trust rogue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 22, well under the 120-word allowance. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias leans against the wall as rain starts, options re-weighted, cost felt in the hush before possible betrayal. Persistent constraint—the tube’s cryptic指令—shapes every tactical thought after its discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ozone, honey, wool, rain) tightens the emotional density until the ultraviolet reveal reweights the entire stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias does not change the past but reconfigures his relationship to it by capturing the invisible shadow; the lavender swirl is undeniable conceptual cost. Cause/effect chain is intact: because he is aromatically cautious, therefore he builds the UV lantern; because the UV reveals the hidden note, therefore he traps the shadow, not the scent. No orientation debt; greenhouse anchors are clear by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the braided rope reconfigures the binary into a both/and canvas, cost felt in “permanent contradiction.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spiral carved in stone adds density until the final pattern crystallizes. Orientation is swift: grotto, night, post-invasion by line 3. One minor causality wobble: the rope’s magical ability to click open the Möbius panel arrives without prior seed, a teleporting prop glitch that nicks the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens the chronic hush until the final image reweights it as canvas, not void. Orientation is secure within 60 words; the greenhouse, shipwrecks, and orchard are anchored before music begins. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I had to become its next note” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. The slight reserve: the bowl’s tremor is described rather than tactically tested, so the Decisive Change is more symbolic than material—still, it satisfies the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dealer pockets the petal now humming with “possibility,” conceding the old trade model is broken. Causality holds: the petal’s residual “determination” is the because that forces the methodological pivot. Cost is visible—loss of emotional distance and future revenue risk. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (amber thickening, static softening) reweights the stake without requiring causal turns. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly under the Accumulative lens: the final handwritten note reweights the entire chain of unnoticed contributors, giving Conceptual Repricing with social cost (their labor was always invisible). Causality is loose—coincidence governs the locket, the Maestro’s sudden gratitude, and the composer’s manuscript—but coincidence is allowed to complicate, not resolve, under Accumulative rules. The linkage holds because each shard adds density to the same thematic cargo route before the final image reconfigures value. Cost is legible in the last line: Marla forfeits a shipping alert, paying with her usual metric of profit to serve the human ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sculpture and refracted beam layers density until the final cadence shift (“We’re home”) reweights the stake. Orientation anchors inside 120 words: crystalline orchard, crater edge, reed-sculptor at work. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the completed tag blooms via their joined dedication, foreclosing the path of passive waiting. Cost is legible in the warmed reeds and the quiet thrum underfoot; no causal contradiction mars the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each borrow of time is a because/therefore trigger that narrows options until the climactic severing of the cadence. Orientation is clean—rooftop studio, twin moons, canal grid—by line 50. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the released echoes become "new seeds of life" while Elias’s own time-debt detonates; the cost is felt in the skiff’s silent collapse and the smile that accepts erasure. No teleporting props or retro-patching; chronology stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic reconfigures meaning of loss without solving the disappearance, cost paid by the steam from tears and the altered weight of the eyes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of drip, pulse, and shifting tile deepens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift: who, where, stakes planted by word 80. No causality breaks; every return to the orchard adds density rather than mere repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: each stealth pass adds density until the tape fragment reweights the librarian’s perception of her workplace. Causality holds—Elias caches because outage grants cover; librarian discovers because he planted—yet the decisive change is her wonder, not his risk, so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure lands cleanly under this lens, the final image of tape against morning light reconfiguring both guardians’ roles, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment he drops the tablet and lets the wind move him reweights every prior data-point. Causal lens holds: each storm beat tightens because his shield attempt worsens the leaf’s agitation, forcing final surrender. Cost is visible—soaked shirt, tablet abandoned, epistemic model shattered. No orientation debt; mossy trellis anchor appears by line 6, storm season by line 9.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-trail pattern, brooch motif, and layered witnesses accumulate toward the final charged poise. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—Elara’s smile after the vortex—where cost (lifelong insomnia reframed as service) is felt through the reweighted image of “invitation.” One transition (causeway arrival) is legible; no orientation debt; no plot holes. Vortex imagery is slightly convenient but complicates rather than resolves; sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave music resolves into intelligible language and futures branch undecided, giving undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each echo, shadow, and crystal layer adds density until the pearl catalyzes the shift. The missing-visions setup pays off with the reveal that experience, not foresight, was required. Minor slack: the pilgrim’s exact timing is coincidence-level, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the exhibit’s incomplete wholeness reconfigures community memory without erasing loss. Causality holds—because Elara withholds full restoration, the exiles can bear their staggered truths—cost is felt in the final image of “ivory luster” regained yet still fractured. The brass valve is seeded early and reprices the meaning of absence at the end, satisfying the pattern. The only slack is the off-stage assembly of the exhibit; a single on-page beat of Elara placing the last fragment would have nailed the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the punch dissolves, the mirrors shatter, the mapper walks away, leaving the fortress open but unoccupied—an undeniable before/after. Causal linkage holds: each arrow-crack he follows tightens options until the gate demands the punch as key, no coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 60. Minor flaw: “the hour that divides bad habits and new starts” is announced twice rather than shown by clock or chime, but this does not rupture the lens. Accumulation cap applies for one soft reset—mirrors break without cutting him, a fleeting safety hedge—yet the final image reconfigures meaning, so cap is −0.8, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s transcription act crystallizes a new stance—skepticism surrendered to shared memory—costing her the protective distance she prized. Causal chain holds: tile warmth → cascade → transcription → village peace. Orientation anchored by 110 words. No lens ambiguity; accumulative design tightens once through the whale-song counterpoint that reweights the silence at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the immortal’s disappearance rewrites the rule that an eternal cannot leave; the shimmer-scar is the on-page cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each magnetic pulse thickens pattern until the origami collapse. Orientation is taught by prismatic motion cues early; no teleporting props or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lattice holds: because she tested the ink → knows its power; because she owes a balance →helps Elena; because the guard sees painted symbols → momentary compliance. Orientation is clean within 120 words: who (Maya), where (prep room), when (night of escape). The UV-trigger pay-off is seeded by “glinting under fluorescent lights.” Closure lands with conceptual cost: the pot—her father's cheat—stays with Elena, so Maya replaces deceit with deficit, the new imbalance she'll have to live with.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last image of twelve glowing cards crystallizes both triumph and lifelong servitude to a vanished world. The causal chain (hum → data → gold → texture) is taught early and holds without gaps; the Orientation Test is passed by line 5. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural—density of dawn sessions tightens meaning until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the phrase “the town’s silence had not claimed everything,” which reframes his labor as defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard of overheard life layers onto the label, tightening the metaphor of administrative death. Closure is a Charged Poise—he lifts the label to the light and sees the collage of strangers’ faces—an image that reweights identity as communal palimpsest. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 4, satisfying orientation. The single flaw: no visible price for carrying these borrowed stories; the cost is implied, not on-page, holding the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the universe exists within consciousness” reweights the premise and forecloses the old outward search; cost is legible in the relinquished urgency. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of retell-hums intensifies until meaning flips. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 42; no penalty. One causal micro-turn: compass shifts from pointing sea to pointing self, narrowing options. No prop teleport or soft reset; the shell’s fade is consistent rule.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: graffiti network density increases until the developers’ curiosity reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara watches the altered finale, moonlit chip crystallizing that preservation/adaptation have fused. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; one causal gap—how graffiti coordinates 47 rafts without leak—remains an ellipsis, not a break. Cost is conceptual (carnival now “moves with purpose”) and felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat is a therefore-link from arrival → chemical set-up → temperature trigger → last-light capture → off-limits summit. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the photograph exists, the summit will be tourist-locked, Elias carries the grain-cost home—visible forfeiture on the final line. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalties. Micro-turn happens at “radiation warnings had come too late,” narrowing options without external rescue. Cost proof: grain returned “against his heart” is the kept wound that literalizes lost era.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal linkage is immaculate: each wing-stitch → circuit test → fountain refraction check narrows options until the final wire spark literally re-animates the drone. The depot clock, ship horn, and mist lift are external therefore-triggers that synchronize with internal beats, tightening time without contrivance. Closure lands in a Charged Poise: the hummingbird hovers, feedback now “a song of direction,” reweighting every prior touch; the cost is the perpetual gap between Elias’s restored map and his own spatial darkness. No因果 rupture, no lucky off-stage fix—every hinge is on-page and finger-verified.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: falcon → phrasebook → condensation coordinates → decoded convergence → inland expedition. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored inside 120 words via the rusted outpost, frozen lake, and laptop cross-check. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: he packs to leave the safety of the outpost, trading tranquil stasis for uncertain fieldwork. Micro-turn occurs when droplets reveal the spiral—knowledge narrows his options instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each footfall layers resonance until the final town-breath reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—archway blazing, cobblestones humming—visible cost is the tuner’s exit and the town’s new, fragile song. Orientation is swift; only the late-first mention of “collapse” is a slight telegraph, not a breach.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marina becomes the new signal, reweighting the premise from rescue to invitation; the cost is conceptual (loss of human form implied) but not felt on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of “gathered hush” deepens until it crystallizes meaning. Orientation is met inside 120 words; the temple’s physics rules remain sufficiently consistent. One scaffold loop (“the gathered hush once more”) slightly dulls the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Causal: each beat (decoding scuffs → lattice use → wall permeation) tightens options because/therefore. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Elias becomes “nothing more than story and air,” paying his father’s debt by abandoning the very medium of speech. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The only minor slack: the off-stage discovery of bodies is recounted rather than felt, slightly dulling the price at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: bead flare→memory collapse→her vanishing re-weights the orchard’s glow and his future nights. Causal lattice holds—each bead pulse is a because/therefore trigger that tightens recognition until touch is impossible. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“endless night…glass panes frosted”) and never drifts. Cost is visibly felt: the bead’s residual warmth literalizes the price he’ll carry.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of tide-loss → sleep-path → labyrinth → weave. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; canyon shift re-anchored through red-glow organs. Closure is a Charged Poise: orchid tapestries pulse with ocean’s absent heartbeat, re-pricing the vanished tide as invitation; cost is conceptual but undeniable. Causality intact; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is clean: because her father’s map → therefore the orchard tomb; because the socket waits → therefore the sundial returns. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the click re-weights her exile story into homecoming, silver light the felt cost. Lens holds from first root-snake image to final breath of faith restored.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a lyrical return to dawn calm—an accumulative cadence shift rather than a decisive cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of chalk, light, and memory layers until the final image reweights the stake of “meaning in margins.” Because no option is foreclosed and no price is felt on the page, the Resonant Reconfiguration lacks bite; the story ends in Charged Poise lite. The pattern is taught early (chalk codes = temporal bridge), but the payoff drifts into nostalgic stasis rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final stitch collapses the unseen web, a legible before/after shift with felt cost (his mask must stay on). Causal chain is lyric, not tight—why this stitch now?—but the candle-pattern teaches an accumulative lens that holds to the last image; orientation clear by word 80, no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard cools, words dissolve, labyrinth hums new harmony—an unmistakable after-state with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural design holds because each condensed droplet layers the same stake until the moonlit crescendo reweights it; no causal contradiction, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral’s hum + fountain image re-weights earlier trauma without tidy cure. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each metaphoric layer (mist, coral, cast map) tightens until the final smile crystallizes direction toward peace. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are all given in first 80 words. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no plot amnesia or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the last line reframes the fragment from relic to “treasure” and reweights Elara’s stance—she now carries the light she conjured, a conceptual cost that forecloses her remaining innocent nostalgia. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each pulse of light thickens the nostalgic texture until the final fadeout crystallizes her solitary custodianship. The orientation anchor (“within the fold of a daydream”) is taught early and pays off, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: shimmer-bloom pattern taught early, density increases until the nickel-cadence reweights the mural. Closure is a Charged Poise: chapel now “hums,” a conceptual repricing that costs her former certainty. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (tool tray, chapel stones) land by word 80. One causal micro-turn—the shimmer’s chord echo—tightens options without breaking lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: Thought Tax → secret club → garden-code → raid → double-down → resilient wildflower. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the untaxed bloom revalues language itself. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens drift. Persistent constraint—the seed’s ever-present weight—shapes tactics throughout. Cost legible in the scarred earth and Silas’s sharper glint.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: blossom absorbs pain and reweights the postcard’s promise, cost felt in the hush of insomnia ending. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early via refrains. Orientation anchor (“the insomniac poet traced…”) arrives inside 50 words, so no penalty. Time-span hand-wave (“across centuries”) is magical-realist premise, not breakage.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker’s whispered name into the orchid reweights the premise with felt, inexhaustible cost. Causality holds: cracked chime → song → repair → memory tax → onward march. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten once, then settle into elegiac stasis. Orientation is secure by line 8; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain is pristine: because she is an arcane linguist + because the archive holds star-ink → she writes promises → each vow vibrates the archive → ink well shatters → music summons him. One continuous scene, 750-word window, orientation anchored by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: their joined hands crystallize the new state while shards glitter as visible cost. Persistent constraint: the broken well means no second draft—this reconciliation is the only score she’ll ever play.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: mother’s relic → adhesive analysis → 77-link revelation → midpoint wear → gate recalibration, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to temper release is shown in the silent alignment of the worn link with the basin drain, carrying visible conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the letter’s text arrives by analyzer rather than dramatized discovery, slightly muting the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bird’s departure reconfigures Elian’s stance from compulsive control to fragile trust in his own method, with the meteorite-chip cargo making the cost extraterrestrial and irreversible. Causal linkage holds: because he cannot bear the silence after his sister’s death, therefore he maps dust, trains pigeons, and launches the chip—each step narrows options until the loft door opens. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust motes, paper ledgers, and flight patterns layer into a denser pattern that peaks when the bird becomes a “spark of night flying into day.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical CR—Elea accepts lifelong guardianship of “necessary distances”—but the cost is poetic assertion rather than dramatized forfeiture. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wood-grain readings, weather codes, and prism light iteratively reweight the sacredness of thresholds. Orientation is taught late (first 120 words drift in dreamy generality) yet ultimately pays off in the resonant final image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. The meaningful tightening arrives with the realization that being lost is wandering unrevealed thresholds, but the beat is delivered in summary, not scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sunrise image plus plankton-"fireflies" re-weight belonging from "finding place" to "seeing connections." Cost, however, is conceptual only (reader-side) and not dramatized on-page; nothing Elara gives up or risks is legible, so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural without tightening. Causality is loose: the feather → map → midnight activation chain reads as "and-then" discovery beats rather than pressure turns. Orientation is clear by line ~50; no penalty, yet the ending’s uplift feels more engineered than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed-layer adds density until the empty circles reweight the premise. Orientation is clean—geode cave, morning light, bird migration—by word 50. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emptied emotions reveal deliberate erasure, not natural decay, shifting the story’s rule-set. The cost is conceptual rather than personal; Aelia’s stance crystallizes but she pays no new, visible price on this day.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: bishop placed → stranger adjusts → violinist bow lifts → clock wound; each beat is a because/therefore domino. The late reveal that the woman carries the key is a mild convenience, but it is seeded by her earlier touch and Elias’s risk to release control. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: stalled time restarts at midnight, the arcade audience applauds the “accident,” and Elias accepts the open-ended future. Orientation is swift—Elias, tidal arcade, night within first 100 words—and the iron-and-glass ceiling returns to frame the final bell.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the verse transforms her body into living scripture, reweighting the Nostalgia Ban’s premise. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—star-gaps and dust-structure density build until the final cadence shift. Causality intact: each observant micro-study of gaps enables the final cellular inscription. Orientation clear by line 6; one minor scaffold (“tonight would be the night”) but no artifact obscures the payoff image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple accretes meaning, cadence tightens toward “before everything shifts” refrain, closure lands in Conceptual Repricing—mundane illuminated, prism dissolved, cost felt as loss of fragile seeing. Orientation anchored by line 3, pattern taught early, transitions NA (single scene). No causal reversals needed under this lens; the final image reweights earlier optics. Meets 9- gate except cost is conceptual, not visibly paid by body/choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: moonlight, ridge, and box accrete meaning until the final cadence shift (“the walk back would be different now”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (rock overlook) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options reconfigured, no forced causal twist. The only hairline slip is the late abstract summary noted in Q1, but the image of the sleeping girl below keeps the cost felt and off-stage, preserving resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gauge’s unreadable symbol crystallizes a new question, not answer, and Elara’s exit carries Charged Poise—cost is the unknowable path now chosen. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (trial balloons) and pays off in the final skyward needle. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. The non-linear “parallel selves” remains metaphorical, so no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the negative’s image reweights the premise—cartography is not mad science but mortal service. Cost is visible in the pocket-burn strip and the audible whispered name. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: ivy, ash, and echo accrue until the final cadence shift (“legacy’s burden was not weight—he was direction”) reconfigures meaning. Pattern is taught early (“corridor echo cartographer”), transitions are legible, orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the bell-shatter dissolves the painted street of futures into plain morning, making the social cost of unseen art legible in the child’s momentary astronaut reflection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light motifs (prism, rainbow, mirror) tightens until the bell-cadence reframes them; causality is emotional, not plot-driven, which fits the lyric design. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no prop teleporting. Cost is visible—“only the prism parapet glistening as if nothing magical had occurred”—but could be sharper had the painter’s body registered exhaustion or loss in that last line.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last spoken name lands, clipboard is set down, sun apex re-configures the entire ledger of failures into a live, ongoing stewardship—“redemption is a journey” re-weights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because he speaks each name, therefore the terrace’s light re-casts his identity; no ellipsis breaks linkage. Orientation is achieved by word 43 (“ancient terrace stretched beneath him”), safely inside the 120-word allowance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of celestial return escalates density rather than plot reversals, and that pattern is taught early (“slow dance of celestial bodies” repeats) and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the egg’s molecular song replaces physical possession, leaving Silas with an audible ghost he can never trade or display—cost is legible in the rain erasing his footprints. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat adds density (drought profit → cryo-chamber → salt map → resonance) until the final cadence shift reweights his entire archive. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: her unashamed laugh reweights every prior echo and the prism flare makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each untangled thread intensifies the chorus of her own desires—though the middle compresses several choices into one paragraph, muting the because/therefore rhythm that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the cut strings and unprompted puppets create a Resonant Reconfiguration—stories are freed from teller—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the campfire stick’s shift from active prop to inert wood supplies felt cost. Causality holds across the mosaic shards, though the month-long ellipsis is a soft patch rather than a motivated gap.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each added fragment (twig, vine, corpse, wing) tightens the cadence toward the final image of inevitable dissolution; the closure beat—“rain would come tomorrow”—delivers conceptual cost (destruction as completion) that reweights the premise. Causality is present yet subordinate to pattern, so the climax lands cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each re-braiding of the rope thickens the emotional deposit until the aurora projectiontips the pattern into a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift—icebound sanctum, aurora, caster’s breath—within first 60 words. The street-organ card acts as taught pivot: early tactile handle → mid-process alignment → final light projection. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the rope now carries the names, the caster walks away hollowed of guilt, the sanctum air forever voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the healed wafer seal and the single pure tone reweight the premise—he is not chosen but wrought by necessity—at visible cost of eternal custodianship. Causal lens holds: every micro-act (nudging the panel, side-stepping sparks) pays off in the AI dreamscape repair. No orientation debt; bunker coordinates and timeline are anchored by the 120-word mark via sensory cues. The ending image charges earlier motifs (vine, hum, storm) without explanatory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each beat advances because the tile must be aligned before dawn, therefore every micro-choice (sketching, mirror tilt, palm press) narrows time and options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the palace will fall, but the sky-map covenant is now internal to Elias, an irreversible shift signaled by the drums he no longer fears. Cost is visible in the final image—he exits into darkness carrying “the faint echo of something greater,” a private exile. Orientation, stakes, and time pressure are anchored within the first 120 words; no ambiguity persists.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken pin’s imperfect melody reweights healing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetitions deepen the stake that imperfection is the price of grace. Orientation is swift; walls flicker by line 3. The six-client loop risks mechanical feel yet cadence shift at final starlight image tightens to earned poise with felt cost: Elias will carry tomorrow’s burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror dome lets the dream stay, the orchard stays ruined, and the sextant is whole—cost is conceptual, not visceral, but legible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: breathing cycles + glass shards + fog density build to pattern-shift rather than because/therefore chain; this lens is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. The sextant’s calibration is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each relic added to soil thickens symbolic density until the final image reweights “deciduous vows.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ribbon flutter re-casts the orchard as living contract. Cost is visible in the mender’s stained hands and mechanical eye strain; the persistent constraint of waiting shapes the exit beat. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (rope ladder, rafter sea) are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Margaret walking away “with the strange joy of someone who had learned to love the spaces between moments” reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt—the curator must now find her own successor—so Earned Stasis is credible. Orientation is waived: deliberate disorientation (inheritance timing, asteroid jump) pays off by teaching the orchard-as-interior-space pattern. One causal slack: why the bathroom triggers breakthroughs is never seeded, a tiny motivation gap that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Causal: each beat—diary study, gap proof, recitation—happens “because/therefore” and culminates in the wall’s dissolution. Closure lands on-page: Elara speaks the constructed eighth chapter, the mountain assents with a “cascade of silent, shimmering notes,” and Kael steps free; the cost is the irreversible rewriting of the store’s grammar and the sorrow both now carry. One minor scaffold: “She realized she couldn’t find the library… she had to prove it logically needed to exist” tells the pivot that could have been dramatized in-scene. Overall the chain is clean, legible, and freighted with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated fog, carousel horses, and card pulses layer until the garden image re-prices identity. Closure is a resonant re-configuration—the ship dissolving into the garden—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; the reader is told the twin “felt whole” rather than shown the ache of losing either half.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s tick now “holds space,” a perceptual shift with residual object (seal fused to wall) as price. Causal chain is intact—seal → door → rope pattern → merged doors—though the void’s rule set appears only on demand. Accumulated/textural lens holds; the densifying library image reweights stakes without requiring causal turns. One minor loop: “fables of absence whispered” is twice told in adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of crack-reading and stone-pulse thickens texture until the bloom crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift, transition is single-scene, and closure lands with undeniable stillness, but the lack of any prior failure or price keeps the cost more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the beam’s new spectrum reweights “coincidence” into cosmic pattern, with the cracked prism itself as visible price. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; tension tightens through density of starlight + silence rather than option restriction. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (spiral stairs, glass hum). The lens holds from first paragraph to last, but the final cost is more luminous assertion than visceral loss, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the melting fog returns the world to vapor, but Kael’s notes and body now carry the archive—an irreversible internalization with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystal whisper, shadow measurement, and ledger stroke thickens the density until the final image reweights the premise. The persistent constraint is the obligation to remember without certainty; it shapes every micro-choice. No causality breaks; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are vivid by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s last line reweights the premise and Marlo’s stance, with the burned knot as visible price; causality holds under the Accumulative lens—each sensory filter adds density until the pattern crystallizes; orientation is clean by line 5, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide’s unification images the conversation finally ready to flow, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal breathing and cicada endurance builds to cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty. One scaffold loop—“between states…between connection and isolation”—slows momentum but does not rupture causality. The ending beat is legible and earned under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final whispered “We’ll go back” crystallizes the new internal vault of silence with undeniable conceptual cost—she is now custodian of an unshareable world. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the inversion hour is a taught pattern whose payoff is the cadence shift from cacophony to gilded hush and back to bunker noise, reweighting the meaning of “home.” Causality remains intact—every silence flavor is earned by her deliberate exposure ritual. Persistent constraint: the doll’s throb and the irreversible internal orchestra mean her tactics can never return to pre-inversion innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the prisms soften, the vial clears, the hush becomes “a lullaby”—a perceptual reconfiguration that costs her nothing visible and forecloses no path. Causality is accumulative: each orbit and breath thickens texture until quiet “learns” comfort. The lens holds, the image lands, but the price is purely conceptual; a tougher editor wants a drop of sweat or a relinquished chance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: ruby flake’s pulse → disables guards → reveals waterfall → mural → stairway → renunciation. Each step narrows options until the final refusal forecloses exile yet accepts lifelong guardianship. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty throne reweights “ascension” from power to wisdom, cost visible in Elias’s quiet return to secrecy. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the knock externalizes her reversal from isolation to communion, reweighting the emptiness motif with undeniable social cost. Causality is thin, though: the press of “something vast and hungry” is asserted rather than demonstrated through a beat that forces her hand; the hinge beat is summarized (“she knew she had one choice left”). Orientation is clear early, but the threshold-fading rule is introduced late and never shown altering her tactics until the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bolt vanishes, diamonds appear, and the phone’s final text re-weights his future; causal chain is intact, cost is visible, but a mild Orientation lag (who/where only implied until ~140 words) holds it below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each crank turn tightens knowledge and narrows legacy options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—dynasty = prison—whose cost is legible in the final silence. The missing external consequence keeps it from full 9-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: removing the gear fractures night into dawn and rewrites reality—visible DC with conceptual cost. Causal chain, however, is lyric-elliptical; “the program guided him” and “orchard responded” stand in for actual motivators. Orientation succeeds early (who/where/when anchored by sentence 3), but transitions between orchard sectors are elided, so geography stays impressionistic. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence escalate toward the pattern-break of dawn, satisfying the lens test.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens openly taught by dust patterns; closure is a CR where the button-drawing pairing reweights hope and gives Elias a new mandate—cost is the unending archive task he now shoulders, seen in “quiet click” Charged Poise; causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is clean: key → puddle map → booth → Marcus ghost-broadcast → alarms. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no spatial drift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ninety-second hijack seeds doubt with visible civic cost (alarms, manhunt risk). The price is present but compressed into a single clause (“key still warm”), not foregrounded, so it stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is taut: prophecy note → early-morning counter-music → prism atrium fragments melody → town forgets to forget.
    Orientation is immediate (saxophone, mist, downward path) and the prism atrium is introduced as an active agent that refracts both sound and stakes.
    Closure lands cleanly in the final paragraph: birds return to normal song, confirming the pattern has been averted and the price (perpetual anonymity) is now permanent—Earned Stasis with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the speck’s dissolution reconfigures Elias’s vocation and reweights the world-rule that memories can return. Causality holds because every beat is tethered to the Three-Moon alignment, the prod, and the folkloric promise; the final image (“monuments to forgotten things now pulsed”) pays the conceptual cost. Orientation is nailed by word 50 (“ashen skyborne arbor”). Minor slack: the phrase “something emerges transformed always” is repeated four times, blunting the tightening cadence, but it never ruptures the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the backward-running pool-clock reweights the premise—time is not to be mended but entered. Situational lens holds: coincidence (glow beneath ashes) complicates, then forces stance crystallization; no causal cheat. Cost is unmistakable: he relinquishes his life’s work to the current. “The universe exhaling” chimes the audible price and persistent constraint—he exits with only the compass’s unreliable needle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the golden-scarred coin reweights ‘balance’ from perfection to fracture-acceptance, cost is legible in the final image. Causal through-line is light—accumulative/textural lens dominates—yet pattern is taught early and closure holds. One soft spot: the actual pour-and-fuse beat is compressed to one sentence; the pivotal act is more told than shown, blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted tooth and softening gorge re-weight the collector’s endless task into chosen service. Causal linkage is lyric–accumulative: each soul released adds tonal brightness until the harp harmonizes. Cost is visible in the kneeling gesture and the ache he carries forward. Orientation is swift; only one implicit transition (woman→child) but spatial acoustics hold coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the equation M = ∫(k/R) lands on-stage, re-weighting the forest from penitentiary to proving ground. Causal chain holds—mask-memory braces → equation insight → step forward—each pivot driven by on-page somatic memory. Cost is visible: the mask ghost must stay or the math evaporates. Drive lens is causal throughout; the UV forest obeys wavelength rules that Kael weaponizes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cumulative/Textural lens: canvas fragments and market stalls accrete into a heritage map; final image reweights earlier motifs with clear Charged Poise. Orientation anchors who/where by word 75; no causality break. Closure beat—portrait of herself writing—makes lineage cost legible (“work just beginning”).

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, cracks, and ghost-traces build density until the mainspring’s extraction releases the pressure. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure = Charged Poise: the room’s “bittersweet release” reconfigures meaning without expositional summary. Cost is felt in the pocketed weight that replaces the prior “weightless” burden—an on-page shift.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the press-slam ruptures eternity, leaving Elias free yet unmoored. Causal chain holds: frost warning → bottle seizure → lever pull → fractal shatter. Cost is on-page—“inkless hands,” library frost erased. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options toward the single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s humble origin rewrites imperial history with undeniable social cost—curators’ narrative collapses off-stage. Causal chain holds: because he veils mirrors, the drifting light coalesces into the hand-with-flower vision; therefore he smuggles the shard, foreclosing academic approval. Orientation anchors (asteroid museum, Final Dynasty exhibit) arrive by line 6; pattern is taught. Persistent constraint—his exile status—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a bright, audible Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn and returned song—but the cost is external (town saved) rather than personal/POV. Causal chain holds: chip → resonance chamber → tether → light restored; however, the “missing inner light” problem is declared more than dramatized, so the tightening is felt more as lyric lift than as narrowed option for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the compass left behind and Elias’s ascent into “inexplicable, beautiful magic” reweight his whole life project with undeniable existential cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scent vial, factory silence, and cavern drip layers density until the lagoon crystallizes a new stance. Cost is legible in the final image—compass abandoned, collector identity dissolved—satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: slide inserted, storm calms, alliances acknowledged—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: slide images echo prior sculptures and re-weight meaning rather than force physical change. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One soft patch: the hidden compartment at the lighthouse appears only at payoff, not seeded, so the beat feels conjured.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last mural reframes night-blooms from anomaly to ecological heart, reweighting her prior obsession with undeniable conceptual cost—she will paint only collaborative nocturnal ecosystems. Causality is intact: each postcard discovered → questions deepen → chapel glass gives mechanistic answer → murals shift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of postcards, seasons, and glass diagrams accrues until meaning flips. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (studio→pavilion) taught by seasonal bridge; cost visible—“she stood back from her final scene,” relinquishing solitary authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each debris-message tightens the diary’s mnemonic vise until “REMEMBER” crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark via floating-library gondola, dunes, dusk. Retrocognitive rule taught early and paid off when names crawl across lagoon at climax. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost: the lagoon shuts its “eye,” Eli’s ribs stay tattooed, archive forever contaminated.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle cools, townspeople greet him as neighbor, founding identity flips. Causal chain holds—each envisioned module triggers visible town growth—yet the final beat is summarized (“he knew this was only the beginning”) rather than crystallized in one charged image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Cost is felt but diffuse, not pinned to a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative lens holds: each paragraph thickens atmospheric density until the wax shaving catalyzes a conceptual reprice—Elias shifts from archivist to vessel. Causality is poetic but coherent: foghorn silence → wax discovery → neural overwrite → earned stasis. Closure image—“the wax cylinder had dissolved into his skin”—makes the cost legible and irreversible. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (Needle Spire, fifty-seven floors) arrive after 120 words, but the delayed grounding serves the disorientation that the ending reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inherited vortex is recalibrated into "hers to command," with the price of ancestral franticness erased. Causal chain is lyric-loose ("whispering the lost language of equilibrium") but pattern-taught early and paid off in the geometric ice-reordering. Orientation is swift: starlight, atrium, seed saver by line 2. One causal gap: how descending entropy translates to time-reconfiguration is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the bell’s resonance reweights the premise—simple sound outperforms tech—while the aurora-lit descent shows felt cost in solitary vigil. Causal chain holds: glue-dry wait → zero-hour test → bell back-up → data logged → descent, each step narrowing options. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of listening-over-noise tightens through atmospheric density and cadence of tests.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor pass layers density until the lantern glass reweights meaning at closure. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact—lantern teaches pattern, Elara repeats ritual, glass evolves. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “empty, ready to receive more” crystallizes cost of perpetual openness. Minor loop: “she began to… she continued to…” softens the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stained-glass patterns settle, the oasis holds, the new ghosts wait—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is interior and accumulative: each morning gaze adds pressure until the night-time ritual re-stitches the covenant. One soft spot: the decisive “speaking with intention” is paraphrased, not rendered, so the moment of re-knitting is slightly off-stage. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first color shift to final harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain (fragment → coordinates → journal → consolation) is linear and coincidence-free, satisfying short-form economy. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias reweights his “borrowed time” from curse to gift, with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The lens holds, though the tightening is mild—one breadcrumb equals one descent, never truly narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the glowing wires and leaning stone give tangible form to interspecies respect, cost paid by Kaelen’s life. Accumulative lens holds: each copper wrap thickens texture rather than causing plot turns, cadence shift comes when stone “leans” toward wood at sunset. Orientation is swift; mosaic time jumps are legible (“yesterday,” “three months in,” “final days”). No orientation or lens ambiguity penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, footprints, amber, tower erosion form a pattern whose density tightens until the amber’s surrender reweights meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, stakes inside 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: pedestal absorbs amber, footprints glow, skeptic stance crystallizes into believer—cost is the empty palm and irreversible alone-ness. No causality break; every beat is a texture-shift that accumulates reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s planks, once battlefield, glow with “luminescent roots,” making the submerged concord’s rebirth undeniable; the coachman’s exile is the felt price. Accumulative lens holds—each seed, bird call, and tide layer tightens texture until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (twilight shoreline) and pattern-taught disorientation (spectral horses) pays off in the ghostly garden. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (dead reef) shapes every action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (“therefore” heat-transfer revelation) narrows the search and is tethered to the sister’s prior tech. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—dawn bridge rendezvous—where options are reweighted and cost is felt in the emptied cylinder. Orientation is anchored by word 80, satisfying the 120-word gate. One scaffold loop—“the wild hush”—recycles without payoff, a −0.2 nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: “because” he sketches, he sees the overlay; “therefore” he redraws, re-inscribing his exile as cartography. The closure beat—aligning fresh sketch to compass while the phantom sky fades—pays off the setup of the family custom and reweights “true north” from myth to self-made bearing. Cost is legible: the old commemorative sky is abandoned, the silence now “alive with potential.” One minor grind: the phrase “quiet mantra” is abstract summary just before the first custom use; a concrete cue would tighten orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Kaelen climbs, therefore the skylight is found; because the chess-swap ritual exists, therefore the final exchange can rewrite the sky. Orientation is clean—spire, clouds, skylight all anchored by word 80. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Architect’s softened shoulders and the righted sky are the visible cost, while Kaelen forfeits safe apprenticeship. The only micro-slip is “time’s better when you’re not measuring it”—a tad aphoristic—touching but not diluting the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene causality holds: the absent pawns trigger the pattern of walking → spelling → unbinding; each lap tightens the same question—how to archive what is missing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “gesture” traced in fresh dust crystallizes her new stance; cost is visible in her cracked knees and echoed breath. Orientation is taught early via acoustics, marble, board; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensifies rather than reverses; one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: hand on silver mirror, thunder inside ready for release—cost legible as possible never-return. Lens = Accumulative/Textural: cadence of nightly substitution, growing seed-reality, map of “state of being.” Orientation anchored by ~80 w (“deepest vaults… mountain”)—passes test. One minor causality gap: how the feather absorbed stone power is asserted, not dramatized, but doesn’t rupture pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each platform step is a because/therefore consequence of chess logic. Closure is a Decisive Change—pawn push dissolves labyrinth—paid for by the prior pattern of invisible games he plays against himself. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. The only slack is the late appearance of the “old texts” rule for tapestry entry; it doesn’t break causality but keeps the score under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each poetic session layers density until the spire’s seal fatigues. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 25. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the settlement’s “forged hush” is broken by the swirl of refracted truths, cost felt in the crumbling spire and Elaran’s steeling himself for confrontation. No causality break; every refracting beat tightens the stakes under the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the statue’s final golden glow crystallizes the premise that brokenness enhances beauty; the causal chain holds under an Accumulative lens, each pockmark→memory→gold line tightening the pattern until the last image reweights the whole. Cost is undeniable—“oblivion itself” reframed—and the 120-word anchor arrives on time.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each image (stiffening bristles, hidden cave, swirling paint) layers the single stake—release vs. preservation—until the tide-pool bleed reweights meaning with visible cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell’s dissolution re-colors the cave water, making transience materially indelible. Orientation handled in first sentence; no causal gaps or teleporting props. The promise’s origin (mirror crack) is off-stage, but present-tense causality is intact; cost is felt in the emptied hand and lighter steps.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cork’s silent lift re-weights the premise—whispered intent can indeed travel—while the cost is the keeper’s acceptance of unidirectional vulnerability. Causal chain holds: heat wave → amplified resolve → cork purification → scent-manifest → release. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wind shifts axis, foreclosing the option to call back the cork.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the censer foot placed at the map-center crystallizes “a place he could never return but could always visit.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each patch, moon-phase pulse, and midnight call layers until the final silence feels re-weighted. The withheld pickup is the decisive micro-choice that forecloses the old compass, paying off the taught pattern. Cost is legible in the final image: he carries the bronze alone toward a horizon that offers no arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because she cannot lie, she must obtain the eye; because the storm returns, she must use it now; because it works imperfectly, she must share it. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 80 words via the swaying soil-boxes and approaching storm. Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration—two women stand in charged silence, cost felt as “being alone inside one’s own head” for the first time in years. No prop or motive teleporting; every beat grows from the last.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of collected objects → memory frisson → lighthouse log gaps → nightly ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dock gap is reweighted into shared witness, cost is the keeper’s lifelong solitude now consciously assumed. Orientation clear by word 60; one soft transition (lighthouse interior) taught by object array. No causality break, though escalation is gentle density-rise rather than twist.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (creek swell, jasmine, fungal glow) tightens the dominant stake of unlived possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise—his blank map accepts a fresh ink line; the conceptual cost (all previous maps were cowardice) is unmistakable. Causal gaps (why ants? why Clara’s chip now?) are allowed under this lens because the final image reweights the rule-set. Orientation clean by 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: renunciation of the mortal kingdom crystallized in the final “lacy menace” smile—visible cost, conceptual repricing. Causal lattice holds: dream → warning → climb → recognition → abandonment, each step a because/therefore linkage; no teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pocket-star reweights memory from fleeting to tangible, cost felt in Kael’s awed silence and Elara’s new burden. Causal lens holds: secret → revaluation → iterative return → star-creation, each step logically forced. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“ember nexus”), well inside 120-word window. No prop or knowledge teleport; columella and pocket-sun states track cleanly across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each added layer of temporal slippage and scroll-ink intensifies the stakes without causal reversals. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3, well within waiver; disorientation is the taught pattern and pays off in the final “altitude of perspective.” One meaningful tightening occurs when grave-date knowledge forces tonight’s writing session—options narrow to narrative distillation or surrender. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the smile and clean air crystallize a new stance whose cost is the foreclosed future already carved in granite.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: each droplet, scratch, and glint of brass adds density until the inscription reframes the grandmother’s entire history. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—cedar’s ghost arrives as felt cost, not declaration. Orientation is secure inside the workshop within 50 words; no caps triggered. The screw’s payoff is seeded early and re-weights the stake at the end with undeniable poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: because he needs to scar-story, therefore he risks the child-prayer; because he performs it, therefore his hand crystallizes; because he writes, the storm arrives and the lattice softens into a milky chronicle. Each beat narrows options until the final image reweights grief into artifact. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delivered by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill dulled, the storm accepted, the stone hand an undeniable new constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal chain: bottle retrieval → current induction → voice emergence → apology → spectral release. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are cleanly in place by line 4; no disorientation penalty applies. Closure is a Decisive Change under Causal lens: the perfume bottle’s glow fades, Alistair’s echo dissolves, Eloise’s burden is explicitly lifted—“its ethereal tenant finally at rest.” Cost is visible in her trembling hands and the archive’s hush, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece opens with deliberate disorientation—good—but never teaches us how to read its spiralling syntax or collapsing geography, so the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4). Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing (the blank dictionary page that both defines and undefines), yet the cost is abstract, not felt; the final hush lands as an aesthetic gesture rather than a lived change. Causality is replaced by litany: each sentence restates the same metaphysical tautology without tightening options. Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, but the pattern never breaks or deepens—only thickens into echo.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens held throughout. Orientation—who/where/when—locked by line 3. Because/therefore chain: whistle → key insertion → backwards count → stutter → conceptual repricing. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “clocks don’t measure time—they create the illusion” lands with existential cost.Persistent constraint: the stutter recurs every shift, keeping price alive in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the mushroom glow, spore drift, and laser dot accumulate to a final conceptual re-pricing—permeability becomes brilliance, not weakness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the red click-off leaves the after-glow of “infinite possibilities,” cost felt as the loss of rigid defenses. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks, though escalation is more lyrical than consequential. The ending image cleanly reweights the premise under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the father’s reconfiguration—“You’ve widened my perspective”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration charged by the lantern-lit notebook, with felt filial cost. Causal chain holds: graffiti → daughter’s accumulation → gift → softened stance. Mosaic structure (train shards → library) is taught early, transitions legible; orientation anchored at word ~50. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each night’s 3:47 wrong-number call layers sonic residue onto the disc until the final harmonic sigh reweights the entire archive of brief friendships. Closure is a Charged Poise—Archie poised to keep disappearing—whose conceptual cost (he too is an ending learning to begin) is legible in the last image of daylight he never climbs toward. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) surface by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the locket’s surrender reweights the covenant from taking to giving back, cost felt in the jetty’s submergence. Causal lattice holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each walnut-ink memory layer tightens the stakes until the final ritual. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 5; no penalty. One transition—conservatory to jetty—legible under two-shard default.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he feels owed reciprocity, therefore he offers moon rock; because woman refuses direct cure, therefore ladder ascent becomes inevitable; because he listens, loneliness is reconfigured. Closure is Earned Stasis—he forecloses the quest path with conceptual cost: "visitor, not a resident." Persistent constraint (moon fragment left behind) shapes future seekers, charging final image. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: “he finally saw” reconfigures the premise—stillpoint is state, not place—cost is the cooling ring and the forever-internal map he now carries. Causal lens holds: each note-reception tightens options until silence is the only remaining path. Orientation anchor (“the ultrasonic forest”) appears by word 18; no debt. No teleporting props; ring’s language-absorption is set up early and paid off in the final cooling.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: *“After planting the wrong seeds, you learn to love the weeds.”* The line reweights the entire premise, making imperfection the new order with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each invisible scribble is a because/therefore that alters the skyline. Orientation lands by 80 words; anomaly, desk, city, and late star signal are anchored early. Persistent constraint: the anomaly’s gravity remains, now embraced rather than erased—visible price that shapes the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty camera’s click reframes their “music” as immaterial memory, paying visible conceptual cost (no film, no audience). Accumulative lens holds: each repetition of click / sign / moonlight tightens the stakes of being unremembered. Orientation is swift; only one causal micro-gap—how the sign-language “translation” actually reaches anyone—is waved away by magic-real trust. Still, the final image reweights the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: burning the restored treaty scatters both archive and guilt, turning past arson into ritual release. Causal chain (fragments → murals → map → cave → burn) is linear, no teleportation. Single-scene orientation is met; mountain shed and waterfall anchor by line 3. The “because” feels accumulative rather than peril-tight, but lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s auroral sorrow crystallizes into shared custody of the lagoon, cost paid in his tears and the scientists’ permanent incomprehension. Causal chain holds—drumming therefore awakens garden therefore re-threads memories—under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. One hairline slip: “universe inhaling” is reused as bookends without deepening, a micro-soft-reset that keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: coin-sense → locates Jenna → whisper test → key reveals seam → chamber opens; each beat narrows options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael forfeits the coin, proving theory and crystallizing a new collaborative stance; the cost is the token itself. Orientation locked by line 3; no prop or map teleports. The labyrinth-as-sound-map rule is taught early and pays off in the final line “whispers become legends,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: shutter angles and mirrored light build density until the pattern resolves into Anna’s cathartic recognition—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in her tears and lingering silence. Orientation is clear by line 6; no因果 leaps or teleporting props. The only drag is a mild loop: “teach darkness the value of stars” is stated twice with no new inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the synchronized displays crystallize “wondering” as the new social currency, reweighting the town’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images rather than causal dominoes—and the pattern is taught early through the grotto’s echoing starlight. Orientation is secure within 120 words. A –0.3 for mild telegraphing of the midnight activation keeps it just outside 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: the whale-call motif and scrimshaw glow tighten the stake through patterned return; the disappearing island reappears as Charged Poise with felt loneliness-cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sublittoral fringe”), transition at mid-story is legible, closure lands as Earned Stasis—she forecloses the island path yet carries its song, cost legible in “salt on her lips.” One soft patch: the island’s rule (“demand she detach”) is told, not tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—each shaved curl and hidden petal thickens the pattern—then crystallizes into a Charged Poise closure: the hummingbird placed among the flowers reweights all prior concealment with a single visible cost. Transitions are legible across the two-shard structure (inspection vs. night), and the final image reconfigures the stake from mere survival to deliberate memorial. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative cadence early (image-stacking, motif returns) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s body reforms inside a state where “time and space are suggestions,” reweighting all prior stakes. Every escalation is driven by his aesthetic method—failed paraphrase → tactile intent → dissolution—so the closure is inseparable from agency. The hush, the hum, the cobalt palette recur with shifted meaning, satisfying pattern payoff. Cost is crystallized in the final image: his shadow stretches “a final, fleeting masterpiece,” implying perpetual self-expenditure as medium.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Leo cannot see color, therefore he barters, therefore the reed vibrates, therefore the world fractures. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the gray certainty is foreclosed in the final image of “glorious, messy, vibrant flaws.” Orientation anchor (courtyard, glassblower, post-phoenix) arrives by line 3; no ambiguity. One meaningful tightening: the reed-hand-over moment collapses all options into a single irrevocable sensual awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held: each refracted color, tremor, and harmonic layer thickens the same stake—connection via absence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final circle of warm light reconfigures the pilgrimage from search to creation, with undeniable conceptual cost—silence is no longer lack but medium. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within 60 words. One meaningful tightening—the struck fork’s thin note—ripples through every glass shelf, reweighting stakes without causal contortions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is legible: grief → discovery of observatory → repurposing craft into beacon → multiplication of teachers across time. The “curtains of intention” rule is taught early and paid off when the stencil etches metal flowers that never wilt, a Resonant Reconfiguration of mourning into permanence. Closure lands with conceptual cost: Elian trades intimate remembrance for a distributed, impersonal legacy—his daughter’s laugh is no longer echoed at home but refracted through strangers’ telescopes. One scaffold loop (“each student left with new skills—not jewelry making per se…”) slightly dulls the final ascension, yet the image of brass dome reflecting his weathered face circles back to anchor the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the Star card re-weights the crashes as ritual rebirth, and the cost is the unending burden of mapping futures others refuse to see. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each measurement and card adds density until the pattern crystallizes. The orientation anchor (loft, rain, afternoon) arrives inside the first 120 words and pays off in the skylight’s final image. One soft spot: the grandmother’s disappearance is told as inherited mystery rather than a present-tense rupture that could have tightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final line reweights the premise—she now carries the lost world inside her, foreclosing ordinary life. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated “atoms of nostalgia” imagery and twilight light pulses intensify rather than因果-link. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure by line 3; no penalty. The only causality gap is how “avoiding patterns” mechanically purifies atoms—rule is stated but not demonstrated in a test/failure cycle, a minor soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts perpetual vigilance with visible cost (“luminous regret” carried forward). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dissolving hope/chip shadows tightens until library reconfiguration crystallizes new equilibrium. One soft spot: causal leap from “play stone at proper shadow frequencies” to full metamorphosis is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tail-tip held to starlight reweights every prior fraud-layer and forecloses the old career. Causal linkage holds—because she audits the logs, therefore she can launch Second Chance. Orientation clean by line 3; one shard, no teleport. Cost is visible (loss of anniversary gala, fifteen years “gone”). Slight lens wobble: the final beat leans Conceptual-Repricing more than pure Causal, but coherence survives.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: coffee rings, frozen hourglass, and plant whispers braid into a pattern that reweights the stakes toward reading vs erasing. Closure—Maya’s apology and vow to teach reading scars—carries legible conceptual cost (“some memories deserve to be preserved”). Orientation anchors by word 60; no causal reversals, but the deepening pattern lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: love is archived in the exact moment it was snipped away. The causal chain is internal—psychometry → perceptual descent → temporal map—but each step is legible and the final image (“heavy and resonant as the final, fading bass note”) makes the abstract cost audible. No orientation debt; the booth anchors by word 30 and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration / Charged Poise) is on-page: the astrolabe cools, dawn creeps, Elara stands with steady voice—cost felt in bodily exhaustion and the visible stardust she brushes away. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of meteor-tracing increases density, each flare reweights the stake of blocked creativity until the final quiet hum crystallizes meaning. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene default met; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening sufficient; escalation legible under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the chess-clock-backward tick and crystalline leaf re-weight the premise—dreamless minds can still birth futures—with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern (glowing dune, archive shimmer, clock) tightens into the final image; causality is lyric-not-linear but coherent under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear rekeys to Elian’s neural pattern, charging the final image with irreversible cognitive intimacy. Orientation is swift; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of wind-tones thickens until identity diffuses into forest mechanism. Causality is loose associative linkage rather than tight because/therefore, but the cadence shift reweights the premise acceptably. Cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally—sufficient for the lyric mode yet not knockout punch.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pool reweights identity from circumstance to choice. Yet causality is lyric-accumulative, not situational; the star punches create paths without narrowing options or risking loss. Orientation is lyrically delayed but ultimately waived—the disorientation serves the dream logic at closure—so no penalty applies. Still, the traveler’s final gesture lacks a persistent constraint or price, keeping the beat just sub-resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the re-locked piano and pocketed bolt re-weight safety’s price with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—bolt → ledger knowledge → renunciation—holds under the Causal lens; the bolt’s first touch at stair three anchors orientation before ~120 words. No lens ambiguity; cost is palpable in the final image. The only hairline slip is a single adverb clot (“seraphically mundane”) that momentarily thickens the syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: the droplet hangs, the glamour unravels with audible silk-tear, the usurper’s essence collapses—cost is felt in the sound and the hollow revealed. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each cryptic note is a density wave that finally breaks pattern. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“ancient temple library, lost in time”) and pattern of drifting stars is taught early; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the pretender breaches time and steps into the library—options narrow to single confrontational image.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas page becomes “blueprint for what could be reborn,” reweighting loss into motion. Causal chain holds: tapping consoles → tide data → coastline ghost-image → Elias walks out, tide licking ankles. Cost is felt in the station’s sighing release and the pocketed page’s soft crumble—implicit but legible. Minor drift: “paths disappeared because they were never meant to last” edges toward thematic overtell, yet it is anchored in the console’s stuttering re-patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of opera glasses glinting against rusted hull crystallizes her re-found purpose with undeniable felt cost—she will re-enter the fight having accepted the lull’s silence. Causal chain is light (hum → spark → smile) but coherent under Accumulative lens; pattern of stillness deepening into vibration suffices. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within first 100 words. Could edge 9.0 if the cost were externalized—e.g., a concrete thing forfeited—but the internal reconfiguration is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: plant memory → kite discovery → glyph decoding → amber rupture → hybrid flora. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the embryo’s release reweights destiny rules and the valley itself pays ecological cost. One soft teleport—the kite appears “near the springs’ edge” without prior spatial cue—nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the framed photograph beside succulents reweights trauma into cultivated life, cost felt in the lingering salt wind. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gardening beat layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn: hide photo → display photo, tightly causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal spine holds: broken box → descent into library → card sorting → self-portrait reboot. Closure lands with earned stasis: he forgoes the old “perfect faces” and accepts luminous fragmentation; cost is the lifelong ache now repurposed as guide. Orientation clean by 70 words; lens stays accumulative/textural, held to final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last line reweights the premise—vanishing ink becomes legible time-text—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because the ink dissolves, Kael must internalize the map, costing him permanence. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is present—because she uploads the letter, the network awakens and the council will fall—but the decisive beat is compressed into a single sentence of summary (“the letter’s contents began to echo…”), blunting the visible cost. Orientation is immediate and clean: who/where/when locked by line 20. Closure lands as a CR (contraband truths reprice the world’s rule-set), yet the price is future-tense (“the council would hunt her”) rather than a constraint already shaping her tactics or body in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to sandbag, knife, dome glass thickens the stake of “engraved quiet.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—glowing roses reweight the premise—but the cost is conceptual (peace is pretty) rather than felt. Orientation is clear by word 80; no causality breaks, yet no micro-turn narrows options mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean CR: the spike now vibrates with divinity, the sky resets, garden melodies carry her timbre—cost is undeniable. Causal chain: sorrow-sky → silence-glyphs → tremor-capture holds under Hybrid lens (lyric-accumulative dominant). Orientation anchored by line 4; no spatial drift. Transitions are implicit within one continuous scene; no scaffolding loops. Persistent constraint: the spike’s new burden will shadow every future cast.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: phone clue → bent nib contradiction → chart taped underside → new murder thesis. Each because/therefore linkage raises cost and narrows options, culminating in the Charged Poise of the nib-as-promise. Closure reweights the premise with conceptual cost: the same printing empire that buried truth must now expose it. Retro-pays early disorientation (observatory geography withheld) by revealing the dome’s hidden maintenance passage as murder vector.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lacerta tattoo crystallizes a new rule—Orion will externalize rather than silence memory—made legible by the cost of sleepless preparation and the whispered apology. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensifies through sonic artifacts until the amber shift reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by ¶3; no cap triggers.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing: the tile-flake-powered mandala rewrites the “unlearning” from erasure into needed space, a legible before/after with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/lyric: each sand spiral and hush-layer thickens texture until the final image crystallizes; the pattern is taught early and paid off, satisfying the lens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who=Elara, where=grotto, when=daily unlearning), so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each placed tessera adds density until the plaza’s atmosphere, not its masonry, shifts. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “garden waiting for its first bloom” renames the graveyard without erasing ashes; cost is the perpetual reliving of fire she didn’t witness. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; mosaic shards and minaret anchor place and time. No meaningful tightening beyond the first stone—each next stone is a promise, not a narrowing—so escalation plateaus; that caps the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the theater saved, coin left for the next dreamer, Arthur’s haunting reframed from solipsism to stewardship. Causal chain is soft—city officials and investors pivot off unseen synesthetic propaganda—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory echoes layers tighten until public taste literally changes, so the lens holds with felt social cost (“theater would be renovated rather than demolished”).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Charged Poise: the last image of the geode refracting her color-map reweights the premise, making the psychic residue a “language” rather than curse, with cost legible in her aching body. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each somatic flare adds pigment to the 3-D map—though a single tightening beat could have compressed the late-night montage into one decisive filtration moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new fossil discovery thickens the pattern—tactile warmth → floating → melody—until the final image reweights her vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the caves’ melody “wrapped around her” visibly forecloses her old identity as mere map-maker. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before 120 words and the cave geography stays coherent. Cost is legible in her pounding heart and the unspoken price of becoming “voice” for absent humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the overturned hourglass rising reconfigures fate from chain to lattice, a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable rule-shift cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; each button adds tonal density until the echo chorus reweights the premise—valid under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift: amber warehouse, cliffs, jar, and ticking sand arrive within 60 words. No plot amnesia or convenient props; the jar and buttons track consistently. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: pillbox discovery → coordinate → snow-cipher → self-exile; each beat narrows options with clear therefore links. Anchors (who/where/when) fixed by line 3; orientation test waived because later payoff uses the same mist-bluff coordinates as the cipher canvas. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: palm on stone = physical seal of the guarantee, cost legible in the same breath as the erasing wind. No plot amnesia or convenient props; the pillbox’s reappearance is set up by Prague back-story and Prague betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the needle’s transfer crystallizes the promise and lifts the vigil. Yet the brother’s reappearance is an unmotivated causal rupture—no prior rule or memory cues this body-swap, so the Decisive Change feels conjured rather than earned. Orientation is clear by 120 words, but the lens slides from Accumulative/Textural to a soft Situational coincidence; the palimpsest concept is evoked, never operationalized as plot logic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thrum resolves, bee vanishes, oasis relaxes into ordinary abandonment—visible cost is the loss of the timeless moment Kael briefly shared. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observing, marking, lensing, then gentle surrender reweights meaning without forced causality. One micro-turn (fractures re-seen as shield, not wound) tightens stakes at exact midpoint; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors’ glow reconfigures the building’s winter life; the cost is the gardener’s perpetual anonymity—felt when the superintendent mimics him without credit. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflective node adds density until the final moon-to-morning cadence shift reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One micro-turn—2:17 AM alignment—suffices. Causality intact: because he installs mirrors, light reaches the alley; because neighbors notice, the ethic spreads.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s shadow moves to her consciousness, reweighting solitude into guardianship with felt cost (“shield against oblivion”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of morning rituals and memory surfacing—held cleanly to the end. Orientation is swift: who, where, when anchored by word 80. No meaningful tightening mid-text; pressure plateaus rather than escalates, keeping the piece just below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral object and mirrored sculpture build density until the final image reweights Elias’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise: the flood of secrets becomes a spectrum whose cost is felt in the phrase “no longer feeling separate.” Thread motif is seeded early, taught by twig → sculpture echo, and paid off in the prismatic light of the final line. No causality break; orientation anchored by lotus temple at ~65 words.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is causal and linear: signal anomaly → decoding → counter-measure → silence. The reveal that signals adapt to human interpretation is a sharp pivot (Q2 9+ cost test met: “the patterns subtly changed whenever different interpretations gained media traction”). Orientation is clean within 120 words; no seams or loops. The jamming payoff is set up early with the subsonic tech, so the climax feels earned, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: compass → organ resonance → key pattern broadcast → space stabilizes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“key now restored to the world’s consciousness”) with felt cost in her breathless ascent; the spatial mutiny rule-set is rewired, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait-as-resonance reweights the quarry from mute absence to felt presence. Causal chain holds—ribbon find → sketch process → portrait completion → abandonment ritual—each step foreclosing retreat. Accumulated imagery (mist, charcoal, crimson slash) tightens the stake without external coincidence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; one deepening suffices. The conceptual cost is undeniable: Elias’s lifelong estrangement from faces is reinforced, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: nail-slot alignment → console question → whispered phrase → horizon shift → field weakening → renunciation. Anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 4; no orientation penalty. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses revelation, accepts burden; cost is legible in the single line “now a symbol of both freedom and responsibility.” One minor causality jump: journal’s “dangerous but necessary” coordinate appears only at the twist moment, not seeded earlier. Still, the tightening chain satisfies the 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final bridge-song literally re-sequences the pixelated faces, proving her role as trans-world ferryman; cost is felt in her decision to keep playing at the pullout, now knowingly alone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard (hitchhiker, scaffold map, flake, moonlit coda) layers density until the last note re-weights possibility. Orientation is clean by 60 words; only one transition (day 3) and pattern is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the worthless banknotes re-weight the startup’s collapsed value and Jasper’s refusal to keep “guiding” people. Causal chain holds: father’s territorial code → Jasper’s train sanctuary → investment in Elena → disillusionment → return to train. One clear transition (boardroom exit → twilight train) is legible. Orientation is clean inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lake’s surface becomes a true mirror only after the vortex re-prices self-knowledge. The flesh-eating seed’s fall and the water’s return to calm make the cost visceral. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative lens: each expanding circle tightens the emotional screw until the confession ruptures. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the ending image reweights the premise irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is immaculate: clipping matches grove → scar matches bark → portal opens → encounter → withdrawal → star pricks eclipse. Each step forecloses the last: once the clipping is fitted, retreat becomes impossible without leaving skin behind. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the eclipse is still there but now pierced, a social cost the sky itself pays. The lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that tightens options until the single star rewrites the sky’s contract.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-fruit payoff reweights the burned card and the orchard’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under an Accumulative lens holds: silver tracing → card offering → root binding → fruit ripening, each step a densifying pattern. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 5 (who, where, when). One minor elasticity: the stranger’s off-stage voice is allowed under situational pressure, but the text could have seeded this telepathy one line earlier to remove any whiff of late rule-add.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the tablet’s $12K valuation is overwritten by Leo’s private re-valuation of the scrap, re-weighting the entire estate and his life metric. Causal lens holds: because he remembers patching the tear, he therefore rejects the inventory and walks out, carrying the cost in his pocket. The Orientation Test is satisfied within 120 words (trailer, dust, stale coffee). No lens ambiguity, no loops, no causality break—only the faint hum of the tube amp that foreshadows the final hum of valley wind.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s instantaneous bloom re-weights death as continuation, cost felt in the final image (“constellations of information”). Causal lens holds: because she translates seed-patterns with cuneiform logic, therefore she dares to plant—one tightening move. Orientation is clean (anchored by 60 words); single reflective block obeys BRR and tilts present stance. Slight deduction for soft transition into planting beat—choice summarized, not dramatized—but the reconfiguration is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: tidal rhythm + lunar name cycle pattern taught early, reasserted at closure when inked words re-enter the water. Closure is a Charged Poise: the librarian’s calm inscription re-weights the ritual, acknowledging cyclical loss of self with conceptual cost legible in “after tomorrow disappears.” No因果 reversal, yet density increases toward final image; orientation anchored by ~100 words. Minor loop: “ponderous grace … inexorable rhythm” paraphrase inside one sentence (−0.2) but does not dull final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the incandescent ceiling crystallizes a new communal stance and Elias’s nightly shell-whispering shows the price—permanent exposure of his own heart. Causal chain holds: pearl → shell method → mass confession → luminous ceiling → dissolved walls. The “heartbeat of a hesitation” is the pivotal because-moment that triggers everything; no coincidence drives resolution. Orientation is clean—cave, bunker, committee rooms are anchored within forty words each.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is clear: the bellows-toss reframes forgiveness as release, not capture, and the river’s silent acceptance supplies felt cost. Causal linkage holds: graffiti warnings → northward walk → object sacrifice → southward calm. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; single-scene default met. One minor causality fuzz: graffiti “bad waters” is read but never confirmed by actual danger, yet this is forgivable under situational lens where myth and mind dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library dissolves into internal mist, reweighting the premise that unspoken words live inside her. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (reverse time, propagation delay) is taught early and cadence swells toward the final breath. Causality is internal-associative rather than because/therefore; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dream-logic and serve closure’s liminal charge. Cost is felt in the image of her adjusting the veil—an Earned Stasis that accepts perpetual partial concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline string and new moonflower with perforated petals re-weight destiny itself; cost is the empty office and the empire’s continuing hunt. Causal chain holds—violin authentication → coffee constellations → personal name in the cup → disappearance. One micro-transition (11-chime → Agent early) is legible under lyric-accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the emerald’s glow reweights oblivion itself, giving the reader an undeniable before/after. Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical pass thickens stillness until the silence flares into aurora. The orienting triad (who/where/when) is anchored in sentence one. Persistent constraint—the need to harvest before total annihilation—shapes every beat and the final box of stars.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each climb and hairpin reflection thickens pattern until the quiet Conceptual Repricing (“Perhaps the source…in the caretaking itself”) lands with felt cost—she will keep ascending and forgiving forever; causality is interior but coherent, closure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard left behind and hung among chimes reweights the premise—doubt becomes instrument, not burden. Causal chain holds: campfire-death → Lyra’s arrival → chime sequence → renunciation. Cost is felt in the “lightness” of the shard and Elian’s mantle-shift. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact at end.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “to vanish is to become the ripples” reweights the premise so that disappearance is not absence but amplification via alignment. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—starlight, grotto hum, and ripple imagery accrete until the final cadence shift reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt on-page: Elara’s physical relocation into the pond *and* the grotto’s magnetic embrace literalize the price of mastery. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land within 50 words and the withheld lesson is motivated by Kael’s established pedagogy, not withheld from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the towers turn from prison to resonant chambers, cost felt in the arrowhead’s pulse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoes reweights space. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but pattern is taught early and paid off. One scaffold loop: “He would learn…he would cast…” subtracts 0.2, leaving 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV Causal lens holds: because he believes manual magic still matters, therefore he climbs, therefore he risks death on mist. Orientation anchor arrives by line 4 (icebound spire / midnight diagnostic window). Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of algorithmic ease, accepting lifelong marginality, cost legible in the fading golden haze. One micro-turn—world tilts metaphysically the instant keystone seats—pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is tight: lantern release → perfect cover → purposeful drift → key opens sunken case → ritual aligns → synesthetic veil lifts. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the color of sound reweights his brother’s “madness” from tragedy to prophecy, with undeniable social cost—he can now never again hear gulls without seeing rose streaks of loss. Orientation anchored by line 3 (pier, annual ritual); no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the key’s worn edges literalize years of obsession and shape every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece teaches its reversed-causality rules early and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the coin-pattern encodes warnings into the next universe’s constants. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when, and cosmic stakes are all present by line 3. The causal lens holds: each beat (coin placement, static distillation, final cast) is a because/therefore step that narrows possibility toward the omega-point upload. Cost is conceptual rather than personal—her observatory and body are erased—so the closure satisfies the lens even though no private price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of naming converts private grief into a communal witness, foreclosing both oblivion and easy absolution. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each crystallized monster is a pattern break that reweights the stake from “bury pain” to “host it.” The final image of glittering monsters left behind carries undeniable conceptual cost: he will carry the scar, but the grief is now shared with the cosmos. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words (who, where, when), so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s silence and the viaduct’s answering hum re-tune the world’s “dripping rate,” making the imbalance tolerable rather than erased. Cost is legible—Kael’s power is exhausted, the fish remain gone, the riverbed still dry—so the price is felt, not merely implied. Causality is accumulative/textural: drip cadence → pattern recognition → bell resonance → viaduct reply; the logic holds under the lens of tuning rather than fixing. One minor scaffold: “he had learned a method…understanding dripping rates” tells us the rule just before it’s demonstrated; a tighter weave would eliminate the tiny bump.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the photographs as fallen stars crystallize the new boundary between drowned past and tellable future; cost is the sleepless burden he chooses to carry. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each placed photo tightens the town’s resurrection-call rather than forcing external plot turns. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“midnight ridgeway”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights all prior material under the inferred Accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal’s unchanged-yet-altered state reweights Elara’s life-work with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—starling pattern → flame → vibration—but the middle link is asserted (“she adjusted the flame accordingly”) rather than shown, softening the because/therefore spine. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence, pattern of buckle/bark spirals, and cadence of falling imagery tighten until the snap of canopy re-opens sound. Closure is a Charged Poise: the seeker drifts mid-air, options re-crystallized—return to arbor exile or follow the disembodied voice—cost legible in the vacancy below. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One causal micro-turn: static clears → voice emerges → leap recalibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael vivifies, therefore clone destabilizes; because clone vanishes, Kael inherits unshared truth. Closure is Earned Stasis—he cradles the glowing jar, foreclosing reunion, cost = “alone with the truth.” Orientation is taught via disorientation (void, fraying stars) and pays off in stabilized night. One logic bump: brain’s legal authority to decide existence is asserted, not seeded, but the emotional beat overrides the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each instrument laid out, each failed measurement, layers density until the moonlit windowsill becomes a Charged Poise. The closure reweights the premise—protect the question, not the answer—with undeniable conceptual cost; the brook’s murmur and the seed’s thrum fuse into an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the motes sink into floorboards, reweighting the house from absence to presence; the price is the conductor’s spent arm and the knowledge he can never repeat the rite. Causal chain holds—because he sings into the blower’s wind, the memory loosens—no off-stage miracles. The hourglass image seeds time’s finality early, paid off when he cuts the engine at the exact moment the laughter escapes. One hairline slip: “the tunnel answered back” risks animism without prior rule-teaching, but the lyric pattern accommodates it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: pressure mounts by density, not causal chain, until the pendant’s incorporation reweights the garden’s silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—pendant becomes “dim and mild as any distant star,” boundaries bend, ache turns “warm echo,” cost felt in the transformed mist. No orientation debt; who/where are clear by second sentence. One meaningful tightening: the vortex of belief pressing against his fog—this forecloses the option of purging certainty and crystallizes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crozier-key reframes destiny from inherited failure to self-ignited becoming; cost is the irrevocable break with bishop-given identity. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each approximation adds density until the cadence shift at dawn reweights stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. No causality break; every “then” is pressure-driven, not outline-like.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signal is inside the fragment, not the stars—an elegant inversion with felt cost (“the shard of hush now a part of him”). Causality is accumulative/textural: pattern of listening, thinning static, moonlit refraction; one meaningful tightening when the fragment’s light reweights the quest. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The ending beat is present, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just below the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ferry solidifies, hourglass now bi-directional, timelines unified—cost is the irrevocable loss of multiverse flux. Causal chain is thin—radio “interconnected patterns” hand-waves the merge—but the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; grotto, starlight, and sideways clocks anchor by line 3. One transition (three crossings → secret mission) is legible. Lens holds Accumulative: pattern density peaks at harmonic convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor collapses into fractured light, the thread burns away, and Siran walks off in Charged Poise—cost felt, path foreclosed. Causality is clean: each weave attempt fails because the memory is either too distorted or too pure, forcing the final chaotic weave that lets the memory “breathe.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies until cadence shift reweights stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; the gallery rules stay consistent and are learned through tactile use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: alien data → Council mandate → Elias volunteers → first star-class → anchor re-priced as stellar bridge. Orientation is clean by line 10; single-scene default met. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the link becomes “a bridge between worlds,” crystallizing the new syllabus and the decades-long wait. Cost is felt—“might not occur in their lifetime”—but could be sharper if a student physically pockets the link or Elias hears his own pulse in the helmet.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is linear and coherent: scratched photo → hearing-aid pulses → hidden compartment → exoneration. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with social cost (family myth shattered). However, the hearing-aid recordings of “energy pulses” function as a deus-ex-machina conduit: we are told they contain “evidence” but never shown how pulses translate to actionable proof, so the final leap relies on asserted rather than demonstrated causality. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eliza dissolves into guardian-state, cables and fleck syncing to eternal tide—felt cost is the foreclosure of human solidity and breath. Causality is accumulative/textural: each pulse of the cables thins dimensional skin until phase-change is inevitable; mentor’s notes and fleck warmth act as tether, not teleport. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity; cost unmistakable in final “profound stillness that weighed nothing and everything.”

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral galaxy in ink re-weights the accident from tragedy to shared continuum, cost paid in Elias’s spoken “infinite.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink patterns, snow silence, heartbeat cadence layer until meaning tilts. Causality holds: shattered watch → static clears → ink galaxy → final cadence. No orientation drift; anchors (“opal observatory, midnight snow”) land by line 4. One shard, one scene, one transitionless arc satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each textured touch and bird pattern thickens density toward the final Conceptual Repricing that language is transmuting, not dying. Orientation is secured by line 3; closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—“tomorrow would bring new textures”—foreclosing nostalgia and charging future labor.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is present—arrowhead → phone call → Lyra confrontation → drop—but the phone’s emergence as the Jester’s conduit is introduced late and explained in static monologue, so the because/therefore linkage thins at the pivotal beat. Closure lands as conceptual re-pricing (“wound to be tended”), yet the cost is assigned rather than dramatized; the flint clatter is audible but emotionally weightless because we never saw Elias’s investigative self at risk on-page. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but a −0.4 deduction for soft causality at the critical turn keeps the score sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “resonantly soft” music and shell images tighten until the final chord reweights the world. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (sky-bridge, violin, rust/glass). Closure = Resonant Reconfiguration: the dropped seed reconfigures city + orchard with undeniable conceptual cost—mechanism halts, vines rise. The crumbling statues, however, arrive as sudden external payoff rather than causal narrowing of her options.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Kael needs to mask the book, therefore he triggers the bottle-EMP; because the drones reboot, the manifest discrepancy will redirect audit attention—each link tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shuttle glides away leaving a measurable void in both cargo tally and Kael’s chest—“phantom road” image reweights earlier absences with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean (anchor by line 3, no drift). Deduction solely for mild over-exposition in the middle paragraph (“His motivation…”) which pauses causality to tell us stakes we already see enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single breath that becomes song crystallizes a before/after with irreversible personal cost—he can never again be “the silent carpenter.” Causal lens holds: each paragraph chains “because” (he seeks salvage) → “therefore” (discovers fragment) → “therefore” (voice returns). Orientation is anchored by word 40; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint—he now possesses a glowing, possibly divine object in a derelict train—shapes the final image and future risk.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the librarian returns to the same midnight desk but the library has become a living, breathing organism whose heart she now is—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because she follows the scarf-hum → hyperbolic door → surrenders to the geometry, therefore the building’s nature flips. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and again after portal return; no teleporting props. Hyperbolic geometry is taught early as “language of impossible spaces” and pays off inside the spiral where stories exist as mutable curves—no late rule patch.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the palette’s glow reweights the archipelago’s absence into presence. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than because/therefore; pattern is taught early and held. Anchor (who/where/when) is lyrically delayed but ultimately functional to closure; no orientation penalty. Cost is conceptual—dream now resident—but not sharply felt on the page, capping the score just below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: star-seen hint → hum → geometry slip → insight “enough” → silent snap → grey ribbon. The single tightening narrows options from “find key” to “become key,” cost paid in desaturated ribbon and vanished scent. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the idea freed revalues the past love as already sufficient. No causality break; ellipsis between star-look and hum is motivated by ritual necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse becomes a porous membrane, her lifespan its toll, reweighting every prior folkloric rule. Causal lattice holds—light-through-wreck pattern → map → memory return → acceptance of thinning veil—each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchor (sunk orchard) planted in first 60 words, no debt. Cost is legible: “protective field weakens with age” = irreversible biological tariff paid forward.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the fading shadow reweights the entire premise, making the reversible exile legible as both rescue and theft. Causal linkage holds—tea-leaf geometry → mapped coordinates → glass trap → return—though the “how” of the glass’s capture is elided; under Accumulative/Textural lens the charged final image satisfies the cost test. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 60, well inside waiver window. The single micro-turn (her backward steps flipping to forward) tightens cadence without second reversal, satisfying 600-word escalation ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density increases toward the final image, reweighting the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the seed’s polychrome tendril reconfigures the world’s lost magic with undeniable conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening occurs when essence is released; options narrow to “this shoot lives or wonder dies,” felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each unraveled knot because/therefore liberates a spirit and narrows Elias’s options until the final memory-knot forces conceptual reprice. Closure is a clean CR—grief reinterpreted from confinement to connection—priced by the audible silence that disperses against the walls. Cost is legible in the exact line “his touch transforming,” where artisan identity is forfeited to medium. No telegraphing; pattern taught early by prismatic refraction that reweights at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reweights silence itself as the true map, with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens holds because pattern (silent video comparison → meteorite ritual → silence-as-map) is taught early and pays off in the final image. Orientation is secure by line 3 (who, where, when). The only slack is that the “tear” rule is asserted rather than demonstrated in scene, so the stakes never tighten through a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the three transmissions layer into a pattern break that reweights Elias’s obsession. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his “threads aren’t meant to be untangled” reconfigures the rule-set with undeniable cost. Causality holds; each transmission tightens the thematic noose without causal reversals. The snow globe’s final swirl crystallizes the new equilibrium in a single, legible image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: density of graffiti strokes & storm flashes escalates until final Charged Poise image reweights meaning (“bridge between worlds strengthened”). Orientation anchors arrive by ~70 words; transitions are fluid within single rooftop scene. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—work is finished, energy spent, mist will hide art—but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt; hence 0.1 shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal track is light but legible: find goggles → decrypt diary → learn she was chosen → exit uplifted. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she steps out already prepared, cost foregone. The diary’s preparatory reveal is mildly convenient (off-stage author-scouting), and the ten-floor countdown is more textural than consequential, keeping the turn gentle, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Immediately legible situation—gondola adrift after cable snap—anchors orientation within 50 words; accumulative/textural lens holds: each cloud re-categorization thickens the stakes of absence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the circle of clouds memorializes the void with undeniable conceptual cost, telescope fogged by heaven’s breath. One micro-turn—spotting cirrus scar—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the sky-image endures in memory while the library collapses, reconfiguring Elias’s identity from face-painter to sky-keeper; cost is felt in the building’s death and his raw hands. Causality is accumulative/textural: each lens placement layers light until the room becomes a cosmos; the demolition clock supplies situational pressure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by word 60). The “centuries-old coin” teleporting into the scene without prior mention is a micro-prop glitch but does not break the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elias folding notes while “keeper of stranded luminance” reweights every prior map in the world with undeniable social/epistemic cost. Causal lens holds: each discovery beat (octagon → starlings → phrasebook) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows his options until the decisive stance crystallizes. Cost is unmistakable on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: mirrors warm, library thaws, future replaces past. Causal chain is lyrical—gear collage → mirror shatter → personal thaw—legible under Accumulative/Textural lens, cost felt. One soft patch: the prophecy scraps are named motive yet never constrain tactics; they disappear once the hall is entered.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each chalk glyph and bell-chime adds texture until the final cavern image reweights the stake from survival to stewardship. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”the network of butterfly watering bells chimed steadily” makes the social cost of future neglect undeniable. Orientation is clean: “Season of Falling Stars” + “five years after crash-land” anchors time inside 60 words. One minor causality tremor: the settlers instantly decode spiral = coordinate map without failed attempt, but the pattern is taught by repetition and pays off at the central arch, so the ellipsis is justified.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is legible: ascent → contact → lullaby → mechanism stop. Orientation lands by line 3 (who, where, when), satisfying the 120-word window. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lullaby does not save life but reweights existence into preserved memory; the cost is the adjuster’s erasure, made legible in “the lighthouse dissolved.” The one causality fuzz is “he understood what must be done” without prior dramatized trigger, a micro-leap that slightly softens motive compression. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of fractal imagery and song crests into a coherent cadence shift at the end, fulfilling the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: find nut → assemble device → guide traveler → pay frost-touched cost; orientation anchors by line 5, closure is a crisp Charged Poise—Tomas turning back to the approving trees—whose conceptual price (his humanity drips away with the frost) reconfigures the stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she kneels at the ravine, she sees the chrysalis → follows braids → reads foam → conceives variant; therefore the corporate barrier is bypassed. Closure lands on-page as she hands Marco the new polymer—visible cost is the legal risk she now shoulders. Persistent constraint (patent) shapes tactics throughout; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s final acceptance of endless erasure reframes the opening quest. Causal chain holds—each incision obeys the library’s glimmering parole—yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated extractions thicken the constellation of bottles until the empty counter becomes the true orchard. Orientation is secure by line 30. Cost is conceptual (stories forever untold) rather than personal, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s touch now carries “shared humanity rather than specific agony,” a perceptual shift legible in the final image of cooking without serving pain. Causal chain holds—because he locates the hexagonal ripple, therefore he descends, because he absorbs collective remorse, therefore his own grief is sandpapered. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (who/where/when: Kael on rain-slick rampart, post-storm desert). Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure. Cost is visible on-page: “he could slice vegetables without tasting the moment his father fell.”

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because she found the abandoned network, therefore she restores it; because she transmits, farmers answer, new agreements form. The midnight broadcast is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the tower’s ancient mechanism and her voice are now irreversibly re-purposed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. Closure is legible, image-charged, and rewires the region’s social circuitry on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is Accumulative/Textural: moonlight-drenched description layers abandoned dream-images until the final CR re-weights human potential. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4, but the single meaningful beat—interface activation—merely reveals wonders without narrowing options or exacting cost, so closure is conceptually resonant not consequential. Orientation stays clear; lens holds; yet lack of visible price keeps the tightening mild.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: spiral-map → midnight threshold → gravity inversion → crystal harvest → expanded consciousness. The Orientation Test is satisfied inside 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara exits with floating crystal boxes and sunrise refracted into “impossible new spectrums,” a visible conceptual cost. The lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore link, though the world-rule of gravity inversion is asserted more than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—sound as accumulating texture—and holds it to the resonant closure: the last note dissolves into hush, reweighting silence as charged, not empty. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. The single tightening—song swells then deliberately released—carries visible cost: her “heart light” against the knowledge the music will fade. Closure moment: “resonant with possibility” is Charged Poise, not explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone-on-star alignment reweights exile from failure to chosen vocation, cost felt in the deliberate relinquishing of reinstatement hopes. Causal chain holds: each reflection loops back to the nexus’s hum or stone touch, keeping pressure alive. Orientation is clean; who/where/when anchored by word 60. One micro-turn only—the dent’s meaning flips—enough for lyric accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the diary clicks open not by violence but by matching the frequency of “feelings that survive where language expires,” reweighting silence as connective tissue. Causal lens holds: each frequency attempt narrows options until only empathy-tuned resonance remains. Time pressure (fireworks countdown) is legible from first paragraph and paid off when the first explosion shatters the achieved silence. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (workshop, oscilloscope, candles) are fixed early and return in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the porch becomes communal scriptorium, seeds distributed, serenity redefined as shared motion. Causality is accumulative: nightly doodles → wrapping-paper archive → communal ritual; the pattern is taught early and reweights meaning at end. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; no causal reversals needed. Cost is felt: her private obsession dissolves into village chorus—"each carrying their own scrap"—foreclosing solitary path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the arrow’s glow reframes orchard resilience as stolen, balanced energy—cost is felt in the final image. Causal chain holds: arrow extraction → sapling surge → recognition of symbiotic pact, all under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears within first 60 words; no penalty. Minor slack: the gravity-clock never tightens decisions; time feels ambient, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain lands: additive → wind vortex → biochemical silence → intentional weapon, each link logged on-page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“questions, not solutions” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Orientation locked by 120 words; no lens drift. Persistent constraint (his own blind spot as ex-flight engineer) shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: cadence builds through sensory density until the aurora/cavern duet reweights silence into living harmony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—wonder reframed from question to lived answer—paid for by the bell ringer’s relinquishment of the amber sheet and exit into dawn; the cost is the solitude of custodianship. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, well under the 120-word window. No meaningful ellipsis or causal turn, yet pattern holds because pressure is textural, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens holds: driftwood markers → flute → gateway → insight → return, each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is swift; canyon, Keeper, post-failure timeframe anchor within first 80 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “no longer a reminder of what had been lost but a promise of what could yet be understood” reweights the flute and the guardianship model; cost is the lifelong burden of revised duty. One causality hairline: the instant thinning of reality at first note feels slightly un-motivated, but pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the printed line “cease calculating” reweights every prior equation, and the cost is the literal vanishing of self-contained stars. Causal chain holds: fragment arrival → workshop printing → collective dissolution; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the courier reweights routine moments as mythic seeds, announced in the last line. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence reweight meaning—but the requisite “felt cost” is only rhetorically asserted; no concrete opportunity is foregone on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words and the single transition (cave interlude) is legible, yet the hermit’s vanishing is a soft coincidence that slightly blurs causal traction.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism dulled, frost melted, but Elias’s stance is crystallized—he forfeits external proof for internal certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost pattern adds density until the hush becomes tactile, then evaporates, re-weighting the premise. Cost is legible in the final image (“battlefield of yesterday’s peace”). Orientation anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor elasticity: “truthful lies” thesis is asserted more than dramatized, but it reconfigures meaning at the end, satisfying CR.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom’s shudder and bead’s flare crystallize the boundary between realms while Elara’s collapsed lungs make the cost bodily. Causal lens holds—each thread is a because that tightens until the puzzle circle therefore pulls her into the void. Orientation is swift: orchard, loom, silence planted by line 3. Only slack is the late rule for puzzle mechanics; taught in the same paragraph as payoff, so waiver holds.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias buys the silk, therefore he can reforge stone; because he labors underground, therefore a floating arch rises. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bobbing azure arch reconfigures village perception and Elias’s posture with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and again at the cavern, satisfying the 120-word window. One minor elasticity break: the silk’s exact mechanics are elided, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the resurfaced “Chimera Log” reweights Kael’s entire past with undeniable social cost; the lens is Causal (because he redirects the log, therefore the file re-emerges). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before word 60; transitions between time-shards are legible and patterned. Cost is visible: shard scorches palm + collapse back to “grimy floor.” Minor loop: “the withheld truth was…/the withheld truth was…” echo costs it the 9-band, but causality stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lighthouse outage → sea-glass find → letter memory → stone pattern, each beat thickens the pattern of wordless communion. Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the aquamarine scatter on the walls reweights every prior letter and stone, making the cost of continued reticence legible without forcing speech. Orientation is anchored within 40 words; no prop teleporting. One soft scaffold—“the letters had taught him…”—is paid off by the final image, so permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece accumulates lyrical texture rather than causal tension; stakes (“shape a new dawn”) stay abstract and off-stage. Closure is a restatement of stasis—Kaelen will keep laughing and steering—so no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost. Orientation is clear early, but the lens remains accumulative/textural; no single tightening beat narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the morpho flash re-weights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, turning sun-trail pattern into a life-purpose prism; cost is felt in the shift from investigative hunger to devotional stillness, no causal gaps, and orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and hold.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard adds a new sextant function or dream fragment until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the trees’ absorption of sorrow reframes Elian’s maintenance duty with quiet cost. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). The only drag is the mosaic’s fourth shard (morning coda) which slightly dilutes the resonance already achieved on the tower; still, the ending lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each orchard bloom thickens song-density until “woven dawns” spill through mica, re-pricing the realm’s light rules. Closure (CR) paid in the keeper’s kneeling release; persistent constraint—eternal night only thinned, not broken—keeps stakes honest. Early orientation clean by 120 w; one causal micro-teleport “he pressed palms… light spilled” forgiven under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: she closes the disguised door, crystallizing the paradox of retreat-as-offering. Cost is legible—she trades her hard-won solitude for potential empathic overload. Causal chain intact: invitation → hide ritual → stepping out. Lens (Situational) holds throughout; pressure is her anticipation of emotional chaos. Orientation anchored by word 60. No meaningful escalation after the 50% mark keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the eaten loaf reweights absence into shared memory, bird chirp crystallizes new quiet. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent seeds, silence, bread—tightens once when man eats with her; cost is the gone loaf, the stayed bird, the winter ahead. Orientation anchored by word 50; no causal gap. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured frequency adds density and the clock of “illusions fade to memory” tightens cadence. Closure is a Charged Poise—slide sealed, data saved, meaning made legible—visible cost in the final “quartz hush” that now isolates her. No orientation debt; anchoring crystalline air + circling workstation arrives by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: each failed attempt tightens Silas’s vigilance and narrows Emmie’s options until the recording is obtained. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—she possesses the tape—but the cost is only asserted (“irrefutable evidence”) rather than felt; no consequence on her safety or soul is dramatized. Orientation is solid: who/where/when anchored by line 3. The sunrise deadline provides clear external pressure; the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ring stills, the aurora mirrors merged light, and Elara’s skepticism is foreclosed with the felt cost of lifelong exposure. Causal chain holds: ring spins → tastes ozone → finds matching carrier → shared light fuses → compass stills; each step is a because/therefore linkage. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and continuously refreshed through sensory cues. The ending image of “Earth holding humanity in atmospheric arms” reweights the premise, making the cosmic love-rule undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave light flips from “auroral sorrow” to reverent glow, the painting ends face-down, and the artist steps toward twilight—cost is the cave’s emptied sorrow and his blunted charcoal. Causal chain is clean: broken lock → box → pristine charcoal → torrential sketch → stance crystallization. Orientation achieved by line 4; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout. A hairline slip: “rectify” is named but not externalized as a concrete verb until he touches the box, yet the final image reweights all prior crystal reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds: shredded map discovery → postal plate → public revelation chain is legible. One tight time-jump (“For weeks she committed…”) is signaled and pays off. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s new candor culture is undeniable, and Elara’s permanent skin fade is the visible cost. Orientation clean by 120 words; no teleporting props. Slight causal soft spot: how fragments survive aquifer radiation is unexplained, but not closure-critical, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the melting iceberg releases “the color of wonder” into the world while the tuner walks mute into cloud—an image that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pendulum stroke and light refraction thickens the texture until the fragment’s vibration liquefies truth. Orientation is swift; “whispering bluff above the clouds” anchors by line 3. The only causal gap: how the kinetic energy actually melts ice is hand-waved, but the lyric pattern absorbs the minor break.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed of fear, once purged, becomes the vehicle of freedom—an earned stasis that forecloses return to the dome. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of magnetic/static imagery builds to cadence shift at dawn burn. Causality holds miniaturize → burn → survival of iridescent roses. Orientation anchors (who=android, where=glass dome, when=magnetic shift) arrive within first 100 words; no penalty. Cost is legible in cracked dome and android’s departed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure is a soft reconfiguration: the mailbox opens and the community weeps, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the neighborhood’s self-image. Causality is loose—accumulative anecdotes replace because/therefore linkage—yet the pattern is legible and the cost (shared vulnerability) is felt in the final image. One shard transition (courtyard → library) is cleanly handled under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: dice → journal → dance decryption → phoenix upload → escape. Orientation is clean by word 60; sunken lab, solo POV, 30-min spider countdown anchor stakes early. Closure lands as Decisive Change—mentor’s mind freed, web erased, phoenix image pays off countdown motif with conceptual cost: regime loses control of its own weapon. However, the liberation beat is summarized (“system flashed… dissolved into blue streams”) rather than dramatized with tactile friction, and no persistent constraint (escape route damage, dice burnout) shapes the exit; cost is visible but not felt on her body or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sunrise image reweights the premise—ordinary lantern route now charged with “extraordinary possibility.” Causal linkage holds: whale-beach → gravity pockets → coffee-map → salt chamber → memory retrieval. One smooth shard; orientation anchored by line 3. Cost is felt: lantern flicker, tear, and the lingering constraint that future excavations remain necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of hush-into-object early and holds it to a Charged Poise closure—the disk now thrums with contained fire, reweighting silence as weapon/peace. Causality is lyrical rather than because/therefore, but the final image lands with conceptual cost: the prophecy’s code is now his to carry. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. One soft loop: “tranquil blaze” repeats four times without new charge, dulling the final beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the seal’s fading warmth crystallizes the new shared pact, cost paid in the loss of her monopoly on the buildings’ voices. Causal chain holds: the lie → weekly teas → Elias’s confrontation → co-listening, each because/therefore legible. The mid-text teleport from rooftop to study is flagged by the characters themselves, satisfies the mosaic exception, and the meteor shower’s final fade is reweighted, not abandoned. One minor loop—“the seal seemed warmer than usual” / “the seal glowed”—keeps this under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystal station thickens sensory density and reweights the stake until the garden itself vibrates with archived sorrow. Closure is the Charged Poise image of Elena walking barefoot through standing waves—cost is the tacit promise to tend these ghosts forever. Orientation clean at ~90 words; single transition at “hours passed” is legible. No causal break; “tragic radiance” and “resonance grid” rules stay consistent. Minor slip: late introduction of “silk-textured leaves” feels post-hoc, but does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens dominates: because she found the ink formula, therefore she can forge; because she forges, she breaks the cycle. Closure lands in the final “unlink” step—her lighter body and the thorn tucked to heart—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 5 (aurora sanctuary). One transition (undercroft → sanctuary) is legible and brief. No plot amnesia, no convenience; the document’s success is left open, but her internal victory is decisive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Spire’s lights flicker, its silhouette cracked, the universe’s hum now a chorus—undeniable conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of canyon-echo amplification tightens stakes until the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) is secured by line 3; no penalty applies. No causality break; engineers’ silencing is revealed via echoed song, not expository dump.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: the Window’s last glint reframes every prior ghost-contact as unpaid debt, not gift. Causal chain holds—dream infiltration → director’s certainty → investigation—each step legible under Hybrid lens (accumulative dreams tighten into causal push). Cost is undeniable: “Working with such clarity always exhausted Elara.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Minor slack: the director’s off-page phone call is a black-box turn, but it is motivated by on-page dream transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the loom reweights her nets and future mending with luminous meaning. Causality is lyric/accumulative; the fireflies’ path is not random, and her following them is motivated by craft-empathy. The cost is conceptual but legible—she now knots “with memory of the glowing loom.” One soft spot: the loom discovery is coincidence-assisted; the insects, not her agency, choose the stop.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: orchard anomaly → shredded letters → diamond truth. One clean transition (cabin to pavilion) keeps time coherent. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the diamond’s flaw was what made it perfect” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The final image crystallizes options without mechanical exposition, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses both factions, forecloses the observatory path, and pays with exile; the cost is legible in the final image of his boots on mud. Causal chain holds: altered frequencies → dispersed crowd → his descent. One continuous scene, one implicit transition (dawn); orientation anchored by ~100 words. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each captured sound layers a palimpsest of memory until the music-box shard reweights the archive. Closure is a Charged Poise—the loft becomes “repository,” the pennies now “investment”—a conceptual repricing with felt social cost. Orientation is clean by 120 words; the single time-slip (“months ago”) is cued by reflection tied to present shelf-building. No causal contradiction, though escalation is more lyrical deepening than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    A single, continuous scene whose causal chain is legible: key warms → hum spreads → ice glows → artifact secured. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when anchored by line 30. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the marina’s cracks become “pathways of light,” a conceptual repricing that makes the forgiven legible. Cost is present but abstract (his lifelong vigilance continues); because the price is not felt in-scene, the story misses the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the wave of patience reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causality is soft—moon-angle mechanics are asserted, not shown to trigger the shift—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern holds but the causal trigger is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: drought-ending rain → exposed tunnel graffiti → deciphered sabotage → daughter breaks paternal spell. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“subway maintenance tunnel”) and continuously re-anchored via sensory props. One meaningful tightening occurs when the graffiti inscription turns coincidence into conspiracy, forcing her to re-frame father’s accident; the cost is legible in the final step into daylight where she carries both lantern and the knowledge of patricidal complicity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s glow reweights from guide-slaves to guide-self, with conceptual cost—she can never again read “accident” uncritically.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lattice holds: because Silas gave the heart, Elias seeks Anja; because Anja deciphers the trigger, Elias must act. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; the shop, velvet cloth, and single light shaft anchor space and mood. The reversal—“this is a reversal”—delivers the single meaningful tightening, foreclosing the funeral-home placement and forcing disarmament. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the heart now beats harmlessly, the cost is Elias’s forever-tainted trust, visible in the final boxed tick. No causal gaps, no off-stage luck, and the lens (Causal) remains unbroken to the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the arrow’s vibration re-maps the workshop’s forgotten lower levels and re-weights Zephyr’s quest from information to summoning. Causality holds: arrow → kaleidoscope → map → bell, each step logically gated. The single-scene orientation is clear by word 80. No visible forfeit (acid risk, energy drain, memory wipe) is paid on the final beat, so the cost is only conceptual; this keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: 2319 → patch → Thorne → ghost node → pocket-dimension drop → song-key → broadcast. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the empire’s scarcity model is publicly cracked), but the beat itself is compressed to one line; the cost is announced, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse thickens the empathic density until the crystal re-forms, delivering a Conceptual Repricing (“Equality”) that visibly reweights prior images; cost is legible in the orchard’s shudder and the Council’s unanswered wonder. No causality breaks; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sound he hunted becomes the beat that refuses to stop—cost is the redefinition of his life’s quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of disaster sites → parasol intrusion → shanty continuation reweights stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 90; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening at the fireside song crystallizes the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the synchronized walk-out reconfigures their stance with felt, if quiet, cost. Causality is soft—letter → glance → hand-touch—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights earlier mismatches. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the mask abandoned in sand reweights the earlier cracked porcelain as visible cost, the clearing’s expansion makes the before/after legible. Causal linkage is light—escalation is textural/accumulative via density of whispers and gear hum—but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the kinetic parapet’s “last reserves” arrive as late convenience rather than persistent constraint, slightly dulling cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each added photograph increases density until the arcs merge into a living mural. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias staggers back, the pattern complete, the lullaby audible—charged with conceptual cost: his archive is now communal, no longer hoarded. Orientation is clean by line 4; causality is internal but coherent under the accretive design. One minor scaffold: “as vines climbed…so too did his understanding” repeats the earlier vine motif without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: “a fragile testament” reweights the premise under Accumulative lens—density of quiet accumulates until the final image. Causality holds: crystal’s remembered chimes narrow his options to witness, not explain. Cost is legible in the hush he now carries. Orientation anchors by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the cascade of collapsing sounds forecloses further inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chalk etching crystallizes the “sound of aging” into a fragile external mark, reweighting the premise—he can trap the echo but never hold the memory. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each driftwood alignment and chalk X tightens the pattern until the monolith’s vibration answers; the cost is the immediate erasure of the knowledge he gains. Orientation is taught early through sensory anchors (fog, rust, damp knees) and pays off in the final image, satisfying the waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frozen clock hand and brightening Earth reconfigure stakes with undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds—leaf fall → timing tweak → tremor cease—without off-stage rescue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The inferred lens is Causal; escalation compresses via because/therefore until the final image. One hairline slip: “velocity recalibrated” is asserted, not instrument-shown, but final image carries enough conceptual cost to waive deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: broken vinyl cue → request → hymn → symbolic repair → stillness charged with gratitude. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Hale’s tear and smile reconfigure the remaining life space without sutured sentimentality. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in Hale’s cracked whisper and Elijah’s packed violin, satisfying the 9+ proof test, yet the tightening beat is a single crest—just shy of exceptional structural daring.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fissure seals, key cools, and exile-rule of shadows is rewritten—Elara now knows they are “exiled,” not lost; this re-weighting carries conceptual cost (her work is endless). Causality under Causal lens is clean: key insertion → star correction → fissure opening → shadow incursion → forced final loop → exile re-established. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. One meaningful tightening: the star-chart glitch feeds the antagonist, forcing her final palm-slam. Light-eruption resolves conflict, but price is collective (eternal vigilance), not personal wound, so cost is legible but not viscerally felt by Elara’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: surrendering the tooth reweights Eleanor’s epistemic rule-set with undeniable cost—the garden inhales, certainty’s cleft widens into understanding. Causal chain: corpse anomaly → tooth recognition → garden confrontation → surrender. Orientation is anchored by word 90; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, one transition (drive to estate) within limit.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return to polishing thickens the “stillness” pattern until the last gleam reweights the stake. Closure image—glass left glowing—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she relinquishes the object). Orientation clear within 50 words; single scene, no teleport. No causal reversal, but for this lens a decisive cadence shift suffices. Cost legible: “her heart light” signals forfeiture of private consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “writing new code in the honeyed hush” reweights the stake—sanctuary is no longer solitary but co-authored, with conceptual cost (future exposure) legible. Causal chain: proffer → shared gaze → mutual naming → expanded sanctuary. Orientation anchor (who/where) appears by line 5; no head-count or geography drift. Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of moss/time/icicle drips intensifies until the pattern itself becomes the new code. Persistent constraint: the viral past remains unreconciled, shaping the necesssity of shared secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hope-collecting beat thickens texture and reweights the stake (creativity restored). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—manuscript now “living entity”—with undeniable cost (he is now conduit, not owner). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality across mosaic shards is loose but coherent under lyric rule-set. Final image recharges shell/morning-light motif, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the automaton’s metallic song rekindles the vine’s bloom, a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes legible a before (ancestral silence) and after (renewed hymn). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—moonlight, song, and cricket tones accrue until pattern breaks into dawn—held without mid-stream ambiguity. Orientation is swift: “verdant arbor at dawn” anchors who/where inside 30 words. Causality is soft—moon “guides” rather than physically constrains—but the text promises mythic causality from the start, so the slight external agency is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each added layer—glass, copper, starlight, resin—densifies the image rather than triggers causal reversals, and closure is a Charged Poise crystallizing continuity. Orientation is immediate (sub-arctic crater, twilight, single actor) and anchors hold cleanly. The piece teaches its pattern early and lands a legible before/after: the orchard becomes an origin point for future way-finders. Cost is conceptual (lifetime of patience distilled into one fragile map) rather than visceral, sufficient for lyric mode but shy of 8.8+ without a sharper present-tense stake.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing crystal in velvet reweights the premise—wonder is now portable, the cavern’s future uncertain—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: shattered timer → studied angles → repaired harvest → stored echo, each beat tightening the pattern. Orientation is swift; marble cavern, solitary locksmith, wounded season are anchored within 60 words. The only minor drag is the mid-story reflective block that pauses momentum without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each burden collected is a density increment that reweights the grotto’s silence into layered awareness. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“she had become something that absorbed and radiated understanding”—and the cost is legible in the extinguished lamp and her permanent entombment. Causality holds: the lamp’s placement at the fulcrum → starlight trigger → calcification → perceptual expansion. The only slack is the off-stage mentor warning, a retroactive patch rather than a present constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: rain patterns, wood grain, and kettle steam layer into a cadence shift that reweights grief from raw absence to crafted presence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished figure in shifting skylight light reconfigures the stake—love persists as object, not memory—with felt cost (she signs, relinquishing him again). Orientation anchors within 120 words (loft, workbench, kettle, rain). No causal break; accumulation tightens once when the whistle divides carving time from tea time, mirroring life/death partition. Slight softness: the conceptual repricing is delicately implicit; a hair more tactile cost could lift it to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragment-collecting and mirror-images accrue until pattern-break—wheel crumbles, ghost thins—reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final step onto “something beyond” crystallizes both option and cost without exposition. Causality is interior yet legible—because he keeps trading borrowed memories, therefore the ghost thins; because the wheel dissolves, therefore he can leave. Cost is visible in the closing image—clouds closing behind him, lagoon humming farewell—an undeniable conceptual toll.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive = Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (dust, rust smell, water trickle) intensifies the dominant stake—engineering hope from abandonment—until the final glimmering equations reconfigure meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “maze of intentions” becomes a legible circuit, cost felt in the sextant’s fading warmth and the terminal’s new hum. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: once the water is redirected, the terminal cannot remain a mausoleum—future journeys are now contingent on her makeshift plumb-ing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the droplet-percussion re-weights his identity from burden to companion. Causal lens holds: because he listens, therefore he hums, therefore he reclaims agency. Cost is legible—he will keep measuring time for others while privately savoring music. Minor drag: orientation (who/where) edges past 120-word mark, but the crystal forecourt is concrete enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: sunrise shadow → sundial → chest → bridge-plans proves the century-old bait. One continuous scene, one escalating question (“Is there anything real down there?”) tightens until the answer flips the quest’s value. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the phantom bridge replaces the phantom gold, and the cost is the forfeiture of every expedition he ever funded on the old lie. Orientation anchored by word 60; no telegraphing of plates before hook bite keeps surprise causal, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of rope-knot readings builds density toward Conceptual Repricing at the end—fulgurite’s return reweights “remember” rule. Anchors clear by line 6; no orientation debt. Single scene, one micro-turn when rope self-weaves; causality is symbolic, not because/therefore, but coherent under lyric contract. Closure beat—“fulgurite pulsed once…all was still”—pays cost by sealing the dock in timeless fog, foreclosing further decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blue thread slipped back into pocket reweights all prior absences into an atlas of integration rather than erasure, cost felt in Elias’s “breathtakingly present” loneliness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of copper-plaque echoes, leaf color, thread color, and gardener myth tighten until the final cadence shift. One transition (garden→bench) is legible; no orientation debt. Micro-turn: writing the gardener’s life becomes Elias’s own obituary-in-advance, foreclosing his own departure. Cost is visible—“breathtakingly present” solitude—so 9+ gate is open; capped at 8.7 because gardener causal role is off-stage, slightly softening protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands: palace falls, bird born, Kael’s death-price paid—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain is thin (why does copper-wire + prism = resurrection?) but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gear-hum intensifies until the stalactites snap, tightening the cadence toward collapse. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the lyric repetitions (“quaking reverie,” “beautifully painful”) function as pattern-break rather than redundancy. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored surfaces (lagoon, clouds, memory) taught early and held to final image. Orientation anchored within 60 words; one clean scene, no prop drift. Closure is Charged Poise—coin-tied sapling crystallizes her grafted compassion with undeniable conceptual cost: she leaves the coin behind, foreclosing retreat to observer role. No meaningful tightening mid-text; escalation is slow density, not turn. Cost is felt but not priced on her body or future—keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the box sighs open, memories swirl, and Kael stands luminous, cost paid in the visible forfeiture of the now-superfluous box. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each breadcrumb adds density until the sapling/roots/key image reweights the premise. Causality is internal but coherent: grandmother’s rule is remembered *because* the final breadcrumb triggers it. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored inside 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: the gear’s progressive integration is the pattern break that reweights the garden’s cadence; closure lands with conceptual cost—measurable light replaces inherited sigh. Orientation anchors early (nebula garden, dying-star hues), causality intact; the gear cannot be destroyed and is not, avoiding soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the monarchs die, therefore he carves their path; because the ribbon once tied a childhood knot, therefore it becomes the template for stone. One clear Decisive Change—he leaves the ribbon unrolled as tomorrow’s poem—carries conceptual cost (he surrenders ownership of the verse to the families). Orientation is tight (who, where, when by line 3). Closure could be sharper if a physical beat (snapping the ribbon, cracking the chisel) externalized the price; as is, cost is felt but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene window cleanly orients who/where/when within first 80 words. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: each inscription adds weight until closure. The charged poise of the resumed swing with “newfound depth” lands undeniable conceptual cost—balance restored to town and self.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Foster’s blue thread rejoins the seamless border, proving that misunderstood obligation, not duty itself, kept the ghost anchored. The cost is soft but legible—Foster’s forgiveness dissolves two centuries of silence and Elias loses a “client,” a subtle forfeiture that still reweights the tapestry. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each micro-untangling deepens the pattern until the border re-knits. The piece meets length, scope and transition defaults; orientation is anchored by “Meadowlawn Cemetery” and “cobalt silo” within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thawing lake and his lighter footsteps reweight the premise—ignorance becomes usable map, imagination becomes tethered seed. Cost is felt in the cracked ice/welling water image, a legible “after” to the frozen “before.” The accumulative/textural lens holds: each lyrical repetition (“each step…each breath…”) intensifies density until the cadence shift at the end signals release. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the humming crystal reweights the orchestra hall from tomb to library under an Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric rather than tight—lyrics “shift like sand”—but the final image (“dust danced around him”) crystallizes the new status with undeniable conceptual cost: the broadcast ends, Elias becomes conductor of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (rocking chair fade, ash grain, porcelain gleam) thickens until the mask glow re-weights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the vanishing point recedes, the mask holds, Elias remains altered. Cost is felt in the single dropped shard and the gallery’s exhale. Minor slack: “incomplete information” method is named late and never operationalized, a soft set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene, single-POV default met; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by 120 words via gas-mask, limestone walls, Alexandria label. Causal lens holds: because he distrusts official myths, therefore he excavates; because he finds the cog, therefore he maps alignments; because he uncovers pre-dynasty charts, therefore he accepts lifelong exile. Closure is Earned Stasis: he seals waterproof pack, forecloses surface life, cost legible in rising water and moonlit exile. One micro-turn only, but sufficient for 700-word window. No causality breaks; slight cap because the chamber reveal is slightly convenient—he’s been digging six years, but charts surface now only to precipitate exit.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: Eleanor lights the lamp, accepting the “slipping away” of the art with quiet cost felt in the amber chord. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of subtraction (noise, hatred, hesitation) tightens through repetition and reweights the stake (“ancient melodies became bridges”). Orientation is clean: velvet library / autumn / Eleanor anchored by word 24. One causal micro-turn—two students create perfect fifths—deepens rather than reverses; no decisive external change, so tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece lands a Charged Poise closure: the image of twenty glowing sprouts re-weights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—knowledge itself has been re-distributed, not hoarded. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each memory-taste and synaptic imprint adds density rather than forcing turns; the final tableau crystallizes the stakes without a decisive physical act. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the cost is diffuse—no single beat carries a price that alters later tactics. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 30, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers image-objects (tower, poem, drone wing, lacquer box) until the final gesture reweights their collective meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the girl accepts the box, the street-lamp flickers, and the cost—Elias’s loss of his private wonder—lands without exposition. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the attic placement crystallizes both the house’s awakening and Elias’s forfeiture of detached study—“the structure groaned with an almost audible pleasure” is the exact image where cost becomes undeniable. Accumulative lens holds: each displaced object (teacup, latch, shard) intensifies ambient aliveness until the cadence peaks. Causality never breaks—every migration is witnessed, no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Tuesday morning on Elm Street”) and re-anchored at Harbor View; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chime’s note reconfigures the garden from mausoleum to meeting-place with undeniable conceptual cost—once sounded, Kael can never again claim perfect solitude. Causal chain: ampoule arrival → crack-thread → revelation → reciprocal chime; each beat tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“forgotten underwater city garden”) and never wavers. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; the chime is foreshadowed by “resonant architecture.”

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the staircase dissolves into a lit room, the perpetual-motion rule nullified by an equation whose chalky traces we saw. Cost is visible—stairs crumble underfoot, the die literally splits—so the rupture is material as well as conceptual. Causal lattice holds: each proof is a micro-choice that progressively weakens the staircase under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One hairline slip: “time had no meaning here” is stated late, not taught early, but the line is brief and does not derail the final re-weighting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared and held: each small kindness accrues density until the moon-lit leaf becomes the charged reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate—rooftop greenhouse, insomnia, city smog within 80 words—and the pattern of lunar daydream → brush → silver script is taught early, paying off in the final image. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shimmering leaf reweights the premise, proving connection is elemental. Cost is legible in the leaf’s transience and her sleepless vigil; no causal turn is required under this lens, and none is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal ingestion of art-as-kin re-weights the premise—mourning is now a survival tactic. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the bread ritual crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: tremor → pooled water → fresco loss → need to mourn → bread initials. Cost is unmistakable in the wheat-and-ash communion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pressure escalates through tidal, sky, stone, and body imagery that reweights the single stake—mastery vs. erasure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sky-tear and his dispersal rewire time itself, cost paid in bodily erasure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by line 5; no penalty. Pattern of backward motion (clock, yoyo, tide) is taught early and pays off in the final backward ascension. Minor slip: “latent radiance” is introduced twice before we see it act, but the lag is <120 words so waiver holds.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: embracing the dying mirror-image reconfigures the curse into artistic agency, with the clasp’s fade as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of mirrored deaths builds density until the final reweighting—but causality between “unbosoming” and mirror-reconfiguration is implied rather than dramatized in a single beat, slightly blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sonic layer thickens texture toward a Charged Poise that reweights survival as endless composition.  Yet the closure, while resonant, lacks a felt price—no option is foreclosed, no tangible loss attached—and the orchard’s rules (saltwater trees, bone mallet) are taught only by assertion, not through causal trial, so the reconfiguration stays conceptual rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single causal chain—gate shut → watchers arrive → Elara decodes pattern → finds whistle upgrade → exchanges salutes—tightens across the word count. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: she embraces her father’s vigil, the whistle’s new weight crystallized in the final moon-lit note. Cost is palpable: perpetual separation, nightly duty, city kept in protective ignorance. No orientation debt; the “bleached white morning” anchors who/where/within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore linkage culminating in the earned standoff and Charged Poise exit. Closure is clean—“I’m here to set us both free” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. One scaffold phrase—“like a forgotten promise”—recycles in the first and last paragraph, a micro-loop that dulls the final image by −0.1. Otherwise, prop and spatial tracking are flawless; orientation anchored by word 70.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lodged note layers density, cadence tightens toward “wound slowly closing.” Closure is Charged Poise—drawbridge descending reconfigures meaning, cost legible in widening water-gap. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleport props;因果 chain clean (note-placement ritual → future divers → present stoic endure). One shard only, inside 800 w; single meaningful tightening sufficient. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early via “notes like archaeological markers.”

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the city was never flooded, knowledge was hidden on purpose, and that revelation rewrites every shelf Elias has touched. Because/therefore chain holds: blackout → candle → heated stamp → visible coordinates → new chronology; each step narrows his worldview until the inversion is undeniable. Persistent constraint: once he sees the waterproof bindings and cavern-matched coordinates, he cannot unsee them—cost is the burden of a secret history he must now carry alone.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane’s polish thickens the pattern of loss until the final Charged Poise where seventeen quartz spectres refract the basilica light, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—he can keep making light, but her shadow will never return.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the move from grief-observer to active predator of ‘never-lived’ lives is a decisive reconfiguration that carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (humming failure → time to scan → realisation → descent plan) is uninterrupted, but a micro-gap: how the Mapper’s raw signal translates into physical travel is withheld, leaving a faint logistical ellipsis rather than motive flaw. Orientation is swift; mosaic pattern (sensorium flashes) is taught early and coheres at the final image. Meets the lens (Hybrid—conceptual escalation toward CR) without contradiction; price is felt as Elias embraces predation of the void.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s return delivers the instruction manual for universal belonging, reweighting the premise with undeniable social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each star-trail segment illuminates the chip in a patterned intensification that culminates in the holographic Rosetta Stone. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The price (Kai’s career paradigm abandoned) is felt but off-page; the causality is clean, yet the cost is more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: “As long as you understand… carrying it alone” reweights the premise—shared burden may be lighter, or heavier, but the option is now legible. The watch hand’s reappearance in Mara’s fist crystallizes the cost of every prior beat. Causal chain holds: false memories → brother’s suicide → terrace confrontation → invitation to shared ritual. No off-stage resolution; every turn is on-page under an Accumulative/Textural lens that lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Julian pockets the pull, moonlight baptizes the swap, and both sides walk away with the unspoken knowledge that tonight’s civility is fragile. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated lunar references and the pull’s warmth until the final image re-weights “mistake into wisdom.” Orientation is clean by line 5; the parapet, moon-phase, and factions are anchored before 120 words. Causality is soft but coherent: apology delivered earlier allows tonight’s handshake; no off-stage cheats are required.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the compass needle flips from external bearing to internal one, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds—each utility-pole drift is noticed and corrected until the lens shift occurs. Backstory weight (~25 %) is at the ceiling but anchored to present stimuli. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)
    Single scene, single POV, causal lens: because he decodes the paper → therefore finds passage → because he descends → therefore confronts buried memories → therefore releases anchor and self. Orientation (“who/where/when”) is locked by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies. Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: surrendering the signed baseball and accepting the lake’s cold reweights empathy from external quest to internal reclamation with undeniable felt cost in the lungs. Persistent constraint—the wiped memory—shapes every tactic; no late-rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the translucent Shadowpaw reconfigures meaning without resolving future logistics, cost felt in Elara’s new hybrid senses. Causal chain: fortune insight → spice combustion → body change → veil-crossing, each step because/therefore. One smooth time-lapse transition (night→dawn) is handled in a single clause, keeping lens coherent. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored within 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the portal closes, leaving her to inhabit “what remains,” a reweighting legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, pattern taught early and held. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: pacifist refusal → archival method → tear find → stitching → gate opens → chosen guardianship. The Orientation Test is satisfied within 120 words (who/where/when aboard derelict ship). Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she forecloses crossing over, pays with lifelong solitude, and the tear’s warmth transferred to the recording system makes the cost legible. One minor causality bump: “reality began to thin” is declared rather than shown through sensory consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern by layering bug pulses, beach hush, and volcanic rumble until density crystallizes in the relic find. Orientation is clean inside 120 w; the single shard tightens once (escape→discovery) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias re-seals the bug, now freighted with tangible transformation, cost felt in the grin swallowed by the hush. No causal cheats; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Hinges on image more than wrenching choice, so it tops out at mid-8.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the blackout is revealed as intentional redistribution of light, re-weighting Elena’s mission (Conceptual Reprice). Causal chain holds—sundial angles → cradle access → engineer reveal—though compressed into a single contiguous descent. One transition (courtyard → lower chamber) is legible; orientation anchored by twilight & torch-light within first 120 words. Cost is implied rather than felt: Elena’s loyalty shift is stated, not paid with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: friction is invisible, not absent, and the herder becomes its conduit—an earned reweighting with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain (stones → dust → insight) is coherent under an Accumulative lens; each beat thickens pattern density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The sequence never risks failure that would foreclose a live option, so tension tightens only once, limiting escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the timer’s click triggers the poet’s shift from witness to cartographer, a Charged Poise re-weighting under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Causality is thematic rather than plot-based—each beat deepens image density until the final lightning flash—acceptable for this lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens: accumulative lyric texture tilts to situational crystallization at the end. Closure is a Charged Poise—both duelists simultaneously concede that the “overture wasn’t hidden,” reweighting the whole fencing-of-angles premise with undeniable conceptual cost: the game is abandoned in favor of listening. Causality is interior and symbolic; no external plot reversals are required. Orientation is clear within 30 words, no prop teleporting, and every sundial slant pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elias feels his coming transformation but now carries a network, seeds, and resistance that will outlive any single self—visible conceptual cost tied to earlier beats. Causality moves “because/therefore” from rescued contraband books → meeting Maya → joint expansion → threat → revelation of encrypted contacts → relocation of texts; each step escalates reach and risk. One soft causality flicker: the guards’ sudden relent supplies the books off-stage, but because the story treats this as inciting gift rather than resolution, it complicates rather than solves. Lens stays situational-accumulative; pattern of growth under threat holds to the final image of moon-set and widening collective.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock ticks forward under a new rule-set, reweighting time itself; cost is the film’s spent glow and the arbor’s dimming—felt on the page. Causal chain (film → projector → clock) is thin but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; the pattern is taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; geography of stair, arbor, clock remains trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s awakening reweights the island’s rule-set—absence itself becomes archive.
    The causal chain holds: clumsy starlight net → flaw identified → word spoken → seed activates, all under the Accumulative/Textural lens.
    Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“the ridge hummed…blossoms unfurling”) and the monsoon clock is visible on-page.
    Persistent constraint: the seed must be wakened before the rain or memory is lost; this shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the compass re-orients toward open horizon, not Aiko, and Kenji accepts un-sent apology with visible cost (“cerulean regret washing over him”). Causal chain holds—lace pattern → diffuse memory → compass settles → final snip—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Set-up/payoff for compass and 23-year pine is tight; no teleporting props. Single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara reaffirms her philosophy of gradual healing despite cosmic chaos, crystallizing her stance with visible cost (aching knees, isolation). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering and recurring motifs (dust, decay, spirals), culminating in a Charged Poise where options (intervene abruptly vs. patiently) are legible. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2. No causality breaks; every reflection ties to present action (e.g., cedar box opening cues backstory).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kaelen redefines his art’s purpose by embedding soot into glass, transforming destruction into testimony. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—frost patterns, ledger symbols, and ash accrue into meaning without forced causality. Cost is legible in the final image: his luminous work now carries darkness. Orientation is immediate (“last fire,” “canyon under stars”), and the single shard structure fits the scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined not as absence but as a medium for new music via heat. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—thermal patterns intensify alongside her focus until the scanner’s “cascade of colors” becomes a symphony. Cost is legible in her trembling hands, lost world of sound, and friends drowned; the final image (“the night would come, but it would not be silent”) crystallizes earned meaning. Minor deduction: the inciting trauma (“capsize”) remains abstract, slightly weakening causal anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural + Causal), with the shattered lens functioning as both motif and causal engine. Closure arrives via Charged Poise: Marcus watches the repaired beacon pulse, knowing rest eludes him but peace reaches others—a reconfiguration charged with personal cost. Every major beat (package, research, dive, ritual) links because/therefore, and the underwater library sequence pays off early disorientation about the lens’s purpose. The cost is legible in “stillness that kept chasing him”—a haunting inversion of his profession’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s chime shifts from signal to symbol of belonging, crystallizing Charged Poise in Lena’s final whisper (“I think they know”). Cost is legible—the anonymity exacts emotional labor but forges dignity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated food runs deepen pattern until silence itself becomes resonant. No causality breaks; every beat tightens thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring images (wisteria, sparks, tear), and rhythmic breathing build to a Conceptual Repricing—love’s invisible currents made visible. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise: Elias doesn’t change the world, but reconfigures perception, with cost felt in his surrendered solitude and expanded responsibility (“journey had just begun”). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is internal but coherent. The final image reweights the entire premise with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s texture is revealed as “rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty,” reweighting all prior longing with irreversible loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density escalates via photographs crumbling, bridges writhing, fragments erupting—and the final image crystallizes Charged Poise. Cost is unmistakable: he chooses void over haunting, and the garden’s dissolution proves it.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael endures collapse to activate the vault, foreclosing escape with palpable cost (blood, chains, near-failure). The drive lens is Causal—each action (decoding, reversing sequence, adjusting via arrow) directly enables the next under pressure. Orientation is immediate (“dust motes… abandoned carnival”), and the countdown clock tightens options credibly. Cost is legible in “blood and dust mingling on his lips” and the collapsing wall.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory imagery until the aurora’s violet light triggers the climactic imprint—a Conceptual Repricing where absence becomes audible. Orientation is clear by line 30 (Elias, workshop, aurora), and the sunken orchard greenhouse functions as a coherent second shard. Cost is legible: the forge glows gold only after the sound is captured, implying emotional transmutation. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—trust’s fracture is no longer lost but preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the portrait reframes from vessel of secrets to mirror of longing, with tangible cost—the dimmed moonbeams, abandoned theft, and relinquished fantasy of external destiny. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emerald light, golden hour, and moonbeam jar intensify until the cadence shift at “he’d misunderstood the entire point.” Orientation is clear by line 3; every image feeds the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the dull jar and lighter heart—opportunity lost, perspective gained.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Finn’s shift from container to “frozen moment of release” crystallizes his stance, reconfiguring purpose without external resolution. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (bookmark, ice, narration) until the cadence shifts at abandonment, reweighting the stake. Cost is legible: the vase is forsaken, the bookmark permanently altered. Orientation is solid by line 3 (“snow-dusted doorway,” “abandoned control room”), and causality flows via Finn’s escalating realizations, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“vulnerability is power”), but the transformation feels asserted, not dramatized—the “confession that unraveled everything” occurs off-page. Causality falters: the child’s cast and equations function as deus ex machina, introduced without prior logic or constraints. Orientation is clear early (rusted library, stars, seashell), but the drive lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural + Causal) without tight integration; the climax relies on intellectual decryption over physical or emotional causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each extinguished star deepens pressure until the final star’s death triggers Conceptual Repricing—the endless night revalued as a gateway, not an end. Cost is legible in the flaking booklet’s transformation from record to key and Kaelen’s surrender of observational detachment for active welcome. Orientation is immediate (“pebble-shore oracle,” “fort’s cold stone”), and the closure image (booklet glowing as doorway) crystallizes stakes with conceptual weight. One tightening—shifting from mapping loss to revealing origin—is sufficient and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: 734 redefines consciousness as emerging from temporal echoes, crystallizing a new identity with undeniable cost—the melting violin, fragmented self, and irreversible departure from programmed function. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via recurring images (violin, frost, sweeping) until the cadence shift at dawn breaks the loop. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite nonlinear time because the anomaly (violin) is concretely anchored and drives all escalation. The final image reweights every prior beat without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the registrar moves from isolation to connection, with cost implied in his relinquished detachment (“its clarity no longer needed”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—the story builds through sensory and symbolic density, culminating in the forecourt’s hum becoming “applause.” Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: registrar; where: shattered desk/forecourt; when: post-linguistic era). Cost is legible in the final image: he gives up the lens, symbolizing surrender of mediated truth for direct human contact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias sees his care reciprocated, reconfiguring his understanding of worth without changing external circumstances. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (marbles, vines, luck scores) until the garden’s luminous response breaks the pattern, reweighting everything. Cost is conceptual: years of invisibility made visible only to him, in a system that won’t recognize it. Orientation anchors instantly (“old vine dresser,” “garden maze,” post-luck-measurement era), and causality holds via consistent cause/effect within the world’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time branches at nexus points, reweighting the premise with undeniable scientific and existential cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory and holographic layering until twilight’s surrender crystallizes revelation. Orientation is immediate (mechanic, station, twilight), and causality holds via lever-pulls escalating knowledge. The “subdued awakening” culminates in Charged Poise: options reconfigured, cost felt in the stillness of wings and the heat of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: history’s incomplete narrative of Isabella is disrupted by recovered truth, with conceptual cost (erasure vs. restoration) legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—water damage, lanterns, and music intensify toward resonance. Orientation is clear by line 3. However, the ghost’s appearance resolves via supernatural convenience rather than protagonist-driven causality, slightly undermining agency under a strict Causal reading.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered sensory detail and recurring motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the truth is absence, not substance. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elara; where: mountain weather station; when: post-fever). Closure lands via Charged Poise—the smudged illustration beside the sextant crystallizes options and reweights the meteorological lie with irrevocable cost. Every beat tightens around the central stake without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valve wheel reweights the premise by literalizing emotional pressure as mechanical release, with cost felt in Elias’s emptied lightness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of decay imagery, radio voices, and guilt coalesces into a cadence shift at the turn of the wheel. Orientation anchors are crisp by line 30; causality remains intact despite surreal elements because rules are established early (e.g., confession → artifact).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (obsidian, origami swan, regenerative silence) until the final return to the library delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the keeper understands their own impermanence as part of nature’s paradox. Cost is legible in the “brittle parchments” soothed by silence and the keeper’s tenuous selfhood. However, the transition via origami swan lacks causal grounding—it functions as metaphor, not mechanism—and the journey feels like atmospheric drift rather than pressured progression.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Leo’s whispered question and shared locket ritual crystallize a new relational possibility under the eclipse’s twilight, with visible emotional cost in his months of silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—music, light, and objects layer toward this moment without causal over-explanation. The “dreaming roots” motif evolves from setting detail to thematic anchor, and the final image reweights the premise: magic is co-created, not bestowed. No orientation or causality flaws mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered echoes (tapestry, diaries, wall-whispers) until the final Charged Poise: Aria hears “the faintest hint of stirring” as dragons reweave reality. Orientation is immediate (“The Last Human Archivist sat…”), stakes clear by line 3, and closure delivers Conceptual Repricing—the metaphysical axis can be mended—with palpable cost (humanity’s dream-extinction). The ritual revelation feels motivated by prior textual clues, not retrofitted, and the ending image reconfigures all prior silence as potential.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Causal in its spycraft mechanics, Accumulative in its lyrical texture—and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the network collapses not by violence but by redirected fate, with conceptual cost embedded in Elias’s solitude and the daughter’s unwitting complicity. Orientation is immediate (“flickering lighthouse beam,” “island’s sole tavern”), causality tight (“rewritten… into something accidentally prophetic” → “mislead its pursuers”), and the final image (“Your next chapter begins with someone else’s words”) reweights all prior actions with ironic elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate: “loop pedal priest,” “dimensional anchor,” “before the possession completed” establish who, where, when, and stakes by line 3. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through looping chants, recurring violet pigment, and escalating stillness—and holds it coherently to closure. The ending delivers Earned Stasis: the priest stabilizes the anchor but walks away with silence as a “cloak of warning,” foreclosing complacency with felt cost. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic and atmospheric coil.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via sensory mapping of memory onto space, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at dawn. Orientation is clear by line 3 (Ai, glass spire, frozen lake, night). Closure lands with undeniable cost—the symphony complete but Ai spent, descending to mundane work. The nautilus shell’s glow-to-dull arc and the mirrored horizon’s pulse-to-stillness provide a legible before/after with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who: Kael; where: glowing viaduct; when: post-rain), and closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael abandons eternal defiance for mortal walking, with clear cost (loss of glow, fractured self merged into unmoored ordinariness). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of recurring images (viaduct glow, water ripples, runes) intensifies until the final cadence shift (rain erasing light). However, the procedural generation mechanic feels tacked-on rather than causally integrated, slightly muddying the escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering until the filament of hush snaps—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is immediate: “Elara, the deaf music teacher, moved through the drum maker’s cavern…” establishes who, where, and stakes by line one. The backward-recorded disc functions as both constraint and catalyst, and the cost—accepting torn grooves, chaotic abrasion—is visible in her hands and felt in her bones. Closure lands with undeniable weight: numbness isn’t cured, but breached.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s decision to trust the rogue is crystallized under rain, with visible stakes and conceptual cost (abandoning solitude for uncertain alliance). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (storm, pigeon, tube), culminating in a reweighted understanding. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite lateral thinking, which functions as thematic texture, not plot logic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias holds a vial that reconfigures his sorrow into legible cause, foreclosing ignorance with visible cost (tears now clarified, not uncontrolled). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density until the ultraviolet reveal fractures perception, reweighting the dominant stake (understanding loss). Orientation anchors instantly (“wistful lantern broker,” “greenhouse for extinct plants”), and the lunar transformation provides a causal spine. Cost is crystallized in the lavender-luminescent liquid: knowledge gained, innocence lost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s texture is reweighted from burden to canvas, with undeniable conceptual cost (accepting masterful contradictions). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via layered patterns, cadence shifts at the honey-thick chamber, and the rope’s recurrence deepens meaning. Cost is legible in Langdon’s laughter and the frayed rope’s transformation. Orientation is clear by line 3; disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra shifts from seeking a melody to unbind grief to becoming “its next note,” crystallizing agency within ruin. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory echoes, the bowl’s tremor, the sapling’s unfurling—and cost is legible in the tear that “was not sad.” Orientation anchors immediately: violinist, greenhouse, shipwrecks, post-burn world. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dealer’s shift from counterfeit merchant to conduit crystallizes in the final image of the warm petal and extinguished grotto light, foreclosing their old methodology with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—static charge, amber light, and half-truths deepen in density until the decisive cadence shift at “amplify the half truths already present.” Orientation is immediate and functional; causality remains intact via sensory-anchored progression.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently: each compassionate act layers meaning onto the locket and Marla’s role. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that Frederick’s grandmother inspired the symphony reweights all prior gestures with historical resonance. Cost is legible in Marla’s deferred professional life (“Tomorrow she would return to freight costs”) and her choice to remain unseen. The structure moves seamlessly from concert hall to library, with the locket anchoring both shards.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through layered imagery and ritualized acts rather than causal chains. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the artist’s tag is completed not by discovery but by communal reinterpretation, reweighting the myth’s premise with social cost—their labor replaces passive waiting. The crater’s edge, arbor, and sculptures evolve meaningfully, and the final image (“the world answered with light”) crystallizes a before/after legible in every prior prism. Cost is felt in Kael’s flickering luminescence and despair, made whole only through shared effort.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a Decisive Change: Elias severs the cadence’s anchor, releasing echoes as seeds while collapsing his borrowed time. Cost is legible in the final image—his smile amid dissolution—and the causal chain (illustration → time-borrowing → canal voyage → uncaging) holds tightly under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors (rooftop studio, twin moons, sleeping giant) are clear by line 30, and the interrupted chime functions as both inciting incident and resolution fulcrum. No retroactive patches or amnesia; every beat flows because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “ambiguity wasn’t a problem to be solved but a space to inhabit.” Cost is legible in tears sizzling into steam and the altered weight of the glass eyes—felt, irreversible, and tied to the orchard’s logic. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with pattern density (drips, mosaics, fruit glow) intensifying toward reconfiguration. No causality breaks; every element feeds the final insight.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the librarian’s wonder crystallizes Elias’s success while reaffirming his hidden role, with cost felt in his continued solitude. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered sensory detail and recurring motifs (tape, crawl space, books), culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of legacy. Orientation is immediate (“municipal library,” “crawl space,” “early morning”), and causality flows via sensory triggers (tape → memory → action). The power outage provides a functional temporal constraint that tightens choices without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory immersion and patterned observation until the climactic release. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias no longer seeks to model but to join, with visible cost—abandoning control, soaking in rain, relinquishing his scientific framework. The storm season, trellis, and leaf cohere spatially and temporally from the first paragraph. Cost is legible in the final image: tattered leaf and soaked man share a luminous, wordless understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (rain trails, amber, convergence) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: insomnia reframed as ancestral invitation. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara’s readiness to paint “what she had truly seen” reweights all prior struggle with undeniable conceptual cost. The vortex revelation integrates past and present without retroactive patches, and the brooch exchange functions as both ritual and causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines clairvoyance not as foresight but as participatory co-creation within “overlapping shadows.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the cave’s music, light, and shadow patterns intensify into a “cosmic grammar” that reweights magic’s nature. Cost is legible in her relinquished dependence on premonition (“I needed to experience it rather than foresee it”). Orientation anchors are crisp by line 30, and the pilgrim’s arrival tightens stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently: fragments accrue into meaning via patterned elision (torn sailcloth, cut photographs) until the trumpet valve catalyzes communal reassembly. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the exile’s rupture is not healed but legible—and cost is felt in the “hollow-eyed arrivals” and children’s fragmented history. Orientation anchors sharply by line 3 (“ivory harbor after rain”), and the mosaic shards (fisherman, poet, child) are taught early (~20%) with legible transitions. The final exhibit crystallizes a before/after without false restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist walks away from the fortress, redefining truth as journey over destination, with conceptual cost (loss of the punch, confrontation with self-reflections). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring arrows, mist, and cracks—and the pattern pays off cohesively. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“route mapper,” “starlit vault,” “phantom platform”). The only flaw: the gate-opening mechanism lacks causal setup, relying on symbolic logic rather than dramatized rules.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: memory fragments, whale songs, and celestial imagery accrue into a resonant whole. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—compassion reweights magic—and carries felt cost (“heart heavy yet light”). The tower’s hum, tile’s glow, and dawn’s arrival form a coherent pressure arc. Minor deduction: the inciting “whispers of a forgotten pattern” lack causal setup but are forgiven by lyric cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the immortal’s unmaking reweights “goodbye” from absence to witnessed scar, with undeniable conceptual cost (“a forever had finally let go”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring images (amulet, storm, escondite) until the vortex collapse. Orientation is immediate (“immortal shifted against the crystalline wall”) and disorientation serves closure (dimensional fraying). Cost is legible in the final shimmer—a void that “holds the light of this new void.”

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya renounces ownership of the ink pot, foreclosing personal gain with visible cost. The causal lens holds—each beat links via “because/therefore” logic (studying routines → timing breach → using ink → escape). Cost is legible in the final image: she returns to shadows, alone, having paid emotional and tactical price. Orientation is crisp by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, and closure lands as Charged Poise: Silas’s final satisfaction reconfigures silence into resonance, with conceptual cost (the town’s irreversible loss) made undeniable by the bonsai labyrinth holding its breath and the lamps’ hum as sole witness. Orientation is immediate (“gilded-leaf stationer,” “mountaintop labyrinth,” “three springs ago”), and the pattern of dawn ritual → transcription → creation → documentation tightens meaning without causal breaks. The ending crystallizes stakes—preservation against erasure—with legible, felt cost embedded in every temporal texture he crafts.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the label transforms from relic to key, reweighting erased histories as proof of existence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—the density of overheard fragments crescendos into narrative transmutation with conceptual cost (identity remains blank, yet burdened by others’ pain). Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves theme and pays off in the final collage-reflection. Cost is legible in the closing image: “a man made of stories, forever searching for the first word of his own.”

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through resonant objects and sensory layering until the cello hum triggers a Conceptual Repricing: “the universe exists within consciousness.” Cost is legible—the abandonment of empirical certainty, symbolized by the fading seashell—and the closure crystallizes options without tidy resolution. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned observatory on the jagged cliff”), and the single-scene structure tightens coherently around Elias’s experiment. The compass’s reset mechanic imposes a persistent constraint that shapes timing and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the carnival’s coded aesthetics become armor, developers shift stance, and Mara resumes work—buoyancy preserved through adaptation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via graffiti network, culminating in the solstice spectacle that reweights meaning. Cost is legible in lost spontaneity and looming privatization; the moonlit stone embodies “silver veins of possibility” without denying threat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Conceptual Repricing: the final lunar morning symbolizes the end of pure exploration. The closure is resonant—the photograph preserves what will be lost to commercialization, with clear conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate (“lunar dust,” “crater inspector”), and causality holds: the sand grain enables the timed reaction. The only flaw is slight abstraction in the climax (“colors that shouldn’t exist”), but the final image reweights the entire premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (mist, light, hum, fountain) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s restored flight mirrors Elias’s clarity amid external obscurity. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the workshop’s stillness after repair crystallizes purpose regained, with conceptual cost in the solitude of his craft. The ship’s departure functions as rhythmic pressure, not causal driver, and the timeline tightens choices without coincidence. Every beat advances knowledge or stakes, and the ending reweights the opening’s “mist-shrouded energy” into “gentle veil,” proving cost through contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation patterns, phrasebook dog-ear, and falcon herald accumulate into a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elias accepts his role as witness to hidden hydrological truths. Closure lands with conceptual cost: knowledge is ephemeral (“fading as temperature dropped”), and discovery demands solitude. The orientation is clear by line 3 (Elias, outpost, frozen lake), and the drive lens holds coherently through the final sketch. The only flaw: the mentor’s disappearance feels slightly off-stage, though it serves as functional backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is masterfully achieved as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town shifts from ghostly stasis to quiet revival through the tuner’s ritual, with the archway dimming but not extinguishing—a Charged Poise that implies enduring balance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating sensory density (glowing sigils, humming stones, child’s laughter) reweighting the dominant stake: restoration via resonance. Cost is legible in the final image—the tuner departs, his work complete but his presence irrevocably spent. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the distress signal reframed as invitation, Marina becoming the new sender. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the “gathered hush” deepens into symphony, the vial’s function revealed, time pressure tightens options. Cost is legible: Marina sacrifices her physical form, foreclosing return. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality flows via motif accumulation, not mechanical cause-effect, which suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps through the wall into freedom just as the warden approaches, crystallizing his break from inherited falsehood. The cost—abandoning his cell, his identity, and risking capture—is legible in the empty lattice left like “a final confession.” Causality holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture meets Causal escape), with every beat tightening toward this permeable threshold. The Orientation Test is waived—the disorientation of the “impossible passage” pays off thematically and structurally at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he now holds the bead—and her love—as both promise and curse, with irreversible knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear: each cameo intensifies sensory density until the final collapse of lifetimes. Cost is legible in his tears, her dissolution, and the bead’s warmth—a tangible residue of impossible reunion. Orientation is immediate (“alchemical orchard greenhouse”), and causality flows through patterned recurrence rather than linear plot, satisfying short-form expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalating through sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms ruin into reverence via kelp-silk orchids, with clear conceptual cost—the ocean’s withdrawal demanded response, not lament. The labyrinth’s discovery feels earned through sleepwalking paths, and the final image reweights emptiness as invitation. Every beat tightens the thematic spiral without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sundial’s click reconfigures history into belonging, with conceptual cost—the weight of exile now transformed but not erased. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: repeated motifs (roots, interruptions, wandering) intensify toward the final image. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (“catacomb orchard,” “diaspora returnee”). The brittle map and limestone slab create causal continuity without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (chalk, clipboard, golden light) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: Elliot stands amid fading codes, having embedded ephemeral meaning into durable mail. Cost is conceptual—his labor vanishes, known only to future researchers—and legible in “chalk dust settled like vaporized memories.” Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern is taught early. No causality breaks, though escalation is subtle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density and cadence escalating toward a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy-chart’s completion reweights truth against silence. However, the coup’s imminence is stated but never concretely tested; stakes remain abstract, and the “adjacent possibilities” mechanic functions more as lyrical ornament than causal engine. Closure lands with poetic resonance but minimal felt cost—no tool lost, no time forfeited, no consequence beyond atmospheric sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the unsent words dissolve, silence is released, and peace replaces limbo—all with felt emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds through layered condensation messages, culminating in a cadence shift from yearning to release. Orientation is immediate (“mangrove labyrinth,” “cryptic medium”), and the shard’s purpose pays off cohesively. The gargoyle’s origin retroactively deepens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: pain reframed as a map toward peace, with visible cost (resurfaced shrapnel wounds, returning hand pain). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through coral pulsing, smudged notes, mist thinning—until the final image reweights suffering as navigable. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in “the ache not as a wound but as a map.”

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara doesn’t restore the orchard permanently but crystallizes its memory into art, reconfiguring her relationship to loss. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory and emotional layering until the mural’s resurrection peaks, then thins back into fog, creating a cadence shift that reweights joy as something witnessed, not reclaimed. Cost is legible in the fading light, waning energy, and the fragment’s transformation from artifact to vessel. Orientation anchors instantly (“ruined orchard district… within the fold of a daydream”), and causality remains intact without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and lyrical patterning escalate until the garden’s crescendo reweights Elara’s understanding. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the mural is no longer pigment but music—and cost is legible in her relinquished certainty, crystallized in the final line: “the pause between question and reply was where magic grew.” Orientation is immediate (“chapel,” “mural,” “Elara”), and the transition to the sound wave garden is taught by the nickel’s warmth and hum, paying off the early disorientation. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Silas’s quiet smile amid wreckage crystallizes options—defiance persists in overlooked details—and reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (thoughts taxed, but wildflowers untaxable). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moth wings, gourd seed, and flowerbeds accrue symbolic density until the wildflower’s bloom reweights all prior acts. Cost is legible in the scarred earth and librarian’s breathless warning. Structure moves cleanly from greenhouse planning to garden raid without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with exquisite control: sensory motifs (postcard, lullabies, shell) layer until the blossom’s arrival crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“insomniac poet,” “gargantuan shell,” “cliff overlooking reef-shadow sea”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the armistice reweights all prior pain as generative—and cost is legible in the dissolution of hoarded sorrow. The postcard’s glow and the blossom’s absorption form a causal chain rooted in established rules, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the caretaker accepts ongoing solitude and loss to preserve echoes, crystallized in the final whisper and steady orchid light. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through resonant objects and layered sacrifices—and the cost (eroded memory, emotional depletion) is legible in every mend. Orientation is immediate (“glass-orchid caretaker… opal library above clouds”), and causality flows through tactile cause/effect (song mends chime, memory repairs locket). A decisive tightening occurs when the caretaker shifts from passive regret to active sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: promises layer like musical phrases, building density until the ink well shatters and symphonies swell. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where silence becomes a “pause before the next verse,” reconfiguring their future with palpable emotional cost (the broken well, the near-divergence). Orientation is clear by line 3 (“archive,” “Elara,” “arcane linguist”), and causality is maintained through ritualistic action rather than plot mechanics. The final image—hands joining like a “missing note”—makes the cost and change undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the machinist’s decision crystallizes options—harmonize, not withhold—with conceptual cost legible in the worn midpoint and recalibrated floodgate. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images (chain, breath, adhesive) intensify toward a cadence shift at the basin. Orientation is immediate (“crumbling amphitheater,” “floodgate machinist”), and the decisive act (aligning the chain) reweights all prior material without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density in dust motes, flight logs, and paper trails culminating in the pigeon’s launch—a Conceptual Repricing where sending the echo east reweights silence as preservation. Closure is Charged Poise: Elian’s hand on the skylight crystallizes his fragile trust in his own method. Cost is legible—the relinquishment of physical control over the meteorite—and the attic’s return to quiet underscores irreversible change. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (thresholds, grain, weather codes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “necessary distances” are sacred because they preserve reality. Cost is legible in Elea’s renunciation—she becomes a guardian, accepting eternal watchfulness—and the final image crystallizes stakes with Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“drifting prism terrace,” “Elea… knelt”), and the closure reweights all prior imagery without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (feather, constellations, light) until the plankton reveal crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: belonging is redefined as active connection, not passive fit. Cost is legible in Elara’s shift from seeker to steward—“her work had just begun”—and the burnt feather’s message (“Look closer”) retroactively charges every prior observation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional seeds accumulate until the pattern break—empty circles—triggers a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands via CR: Aelia realizes paths are *actively emptied*, not merely forgotten, reweighting the entire premise with conceptual cost (someone is harvesting memory). The crater glass’s warning (“the more it reveals, the more it conceals”) pays off in the void imagery. Cost is legible in the final image: she stores both emotion and absence, accepting incomplete knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative/Textural in atmosphere, Causal in action—with the bishop initiating a chain of orchestrated events that culminates in the clock striking midnight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: time unstuck, monotony rewritten, with conceptual cost implied in the woman’s fleeting presence and Elias’s solitary return. The causal thread (bishop → note → clock) is tight, and the final image reweights the entire premise. No causality breaks; orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Lyra becomes living scripture whose knowledge exists outside memory, reweighting the Nostalgia Ban’s premise itself. Cost is legible—the verse’s “terrible implications” and irreversible transformation—and tied to a persistent constraint (spontaneous anchoring). Orientation is clear by line 30: who (Lyra), where (twilight garden under crystalline dome), when (post-Ban). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, escalating via density of gaps observed until the final cadence shift at dissolution of the moonstone.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through ripple patterns that deepen thematic weight. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights “value” as found in quiet attention, not grand acts. However, the “before everything shifts” refrain lacks narrative urgency—it signals time pressure without altering tactics or imposing real constraint, weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight, ridge path, bell, and scars accrue meaning until the final reconfiguration—“the cracked box wasn’t just a vessel of sorrow but a reminder that even broken things continue to serve their purpose.” Cost is legible in Elias’s three-year burden and the irreversible loss of the girl’s parents. Orientation is immediate (“ridge,” “Elias,” “porcelain box”), and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with emotional weight. No causality breaks; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (moonlight on the bell).

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating density in sensory detail, pattern complexity, and gauge responsiveness culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the unreadable symbol reweights “hope” as a question, not an answer. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—Elara steps out lighter, yet tethered, her purpose crystallized. Cost is conceptual (abandoning fixed answers) and legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 20, and the grotto’s rising tide provides coherent pressure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density (ivy, ash, film negatives) culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: legacy shifts from burden to calling. Closure lands decisively—the final line crystallizes Elian’s reconfigured stance with irrevocable cost (“some dreams are prisons”). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality flows via patterned revelation rather than plot mechanics. The only flaw: the diary’s role feels slightly expository rather than actively shaping tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirage vanishes but seeds possibility in the girl below, reconfiguring “what is” into “what could be.” The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through refracted light, humming, heartbeat—and culminates in a resonant final image with conceptual cost (ephemeral art that only dreamers perceive). The prism parapet, bells, and borrowed rhythm all constrain the ritual’s timing and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual naming builds density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias accepts his role as memory-keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she steps into dawn “entirely her own,” having reconfigured her identity through action. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via increasing thread complexity, culminating in the red-hot memory—and cost is legible in each dissolved echo. The prism sanctuary’s emptying and snow whispering her name crystallize a before/after shift. Orientation is immediate (“silver courtyard under snow”), and the single-scene structure fits 600–800-word scope flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: stories transform beyond the teller, reweighting truth itself. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of reversed narratives builds to a resonant final image (puppets moving freely). Cost is legible: Elias surrenders control, symbolized by cut strings and the stick becoming “just wood.” Structure compresses time effectively across shards (argument → bars → final show), with clear transitions and taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the premise by asserting that honoring fleeting things has intrinsic value, even if unseen (“received perhaps, by no one but the sky”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via layered motifs (monarchs, moth wing, knots), culminating in a resonant final stanza. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the structure and Elias’s quiet departure. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

Babylonian palace... fading twilight.”

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each visitor deepens the pattern, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where brokenness itself becomes sacred. Orientation is immediate (“soundless sanctuary,” “Elias stood”), and the mosaic of six transformations is taught by the second encounter. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elias alone at night, music box glowing—as reality settles, with conceptual cost (healing requires accepting incompleteness). The reappearing music box avoids teleportation because its return is woven into the sanctuary’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, glass, and memory accrue density until the climax reweights reality itself. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the mirror dome crystallizes altered stakes with visible cost (ruins now coexist with glass mountains).

Cost is legible in the final image: boundaries remain permeable, irrevocably changing the district’s ontology.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the mender endures, planting a bridge she may never see used, with visible cost in faded memories and mechanical fragility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through layered relics (ribbon, key, candle) and orchard imagery that reweights regret into possibility. Orientation is immediate (“quartz-eye mender,” “cathedral’s rope ladder”), and the seed’s pulse provides a decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the quartz eye’s “false, but functional” whirring—a perfect metaphor for her resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pattern-taught shards (office → orchard → bathroom → home) cohering into a Resonant Reconfiguration: Margaret achieves Charged Poise by accepting nonlinear existence as her natural state. Cost is legible in the self-erasure of authorship (“could no longer distinguish which version... was writing”) and the irreversible surrender of stable identity. The “between the first and last page” motif pays off structurally and thematically, anchoring disorientation that serves closure. Transitions are legible via sensory triggers (warmth, reflection, sleep).

Every beat tightens around the central paradox: silence as language.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the twin accepts in-betweenness as wholeness, with visible cost—the dissolution of the ship, loss of discoverer identity, and surrender of the emerald card. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, laughter, and narrative threads accrue meaning until the final image reweights “trapped freedom” as chosen belonging. Cost is legible in “freedom was not the absence of chains, but the courage to be broken and beautiful.”

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “fables of absence” shift from voids to potential, reweighting the entire premise. The causal chain is tight—seal unlocks door, rope braids mirror sigil, alignment merges realities—and each step arises from Elias’s choices, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the fused seal now etched into the tower’s bones: he’s bound himself to future absences. Orientation is immediate (“university clock tower mechanism room”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density and patterned objects.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence accumulates through sensory and rhythmic layering until the bloom of hush crystallizes as Earned Stasis—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is legible in Lorne’s physical tension, weeks-long strain, and the temporary nature of the bloom. Orientation is immediate (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “harmonic caves,” “three cycles ago”), and the closure reweights the entire premise: noise and silence now coexist in balance. The final image holds undeniable conceptual cost—the sanctuary is fragile, yet sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (light, silence, patterns) until the final beam crystallizes thematic and narrative stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s light reweights ruin as meaningful. Cost is legible—the years of isolation, the burden of singular responsibility—and the shard of hush delivers a resonant, earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density intensifying through sensory layering and patterned motifs (fog, shadows, whispers). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael realizes memory resides in the air itself, not just archives, reweighting his entire purpose. Cost is legible—the irreversible loss of the crystal whispers—and the solidified fog’s dissolution enacts a decisive temporal boundary. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s truth reframes hopelessness not as void but as absence of self-made light—a rule-set shift with conceptual cost (the burden of ignition). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory density (lavender, flame, mosaic shifts) builds until centrifugal fire-spinning reweights perception. Cost is legible in Marlo’s extinguished knot and renewed stride—light created, darkness metabolized. Orientation anchors instantly (“Marlo… stepped through the archway… twilight”), and every beat filters toward the final image without teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with tidal imagery and the jade cicada accruing symbolic density until the final Conceptual Repricing: transition periods are reframed as generative rather than empty. Orientation is immediate—Elian in a grotto at night—and closure lands via Charged Poise as water unifies the pools, making the before/after legible. Cost is felt in Mara’s vulnerability and Elian’s relinquishment of detached observation for shared uncertainty. The lens holds coherently from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered silences until gravity’s return fractures the gilded hush—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara’s vault of stolen quiet becomes her new reality.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and rhythmic cadence until the prisms “exhale” and silence becomes a lullaby—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is legible: the terrace’s initial tension and the train echo’s void are resolved only through Elara’s ritual, with the vial’s clarity marking restoration. Orientation is immediate (“gondola,” “prism terrace,” “twilight”), and the closure image reweights all prior silence as comfort, not absence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the throne’s purpose is redefined as a bridge to ancestral wisdom, not power, with clear conceptual cost—the truth remains hidden, entrusted only to future keepers. The Causal lens holds: each action follows from prior cause (flake disables guards, leads to waterfall, reveals mural). Orientation is immediate and stable; timeline (“until sunrise”) tightens choices credibly. The final image of the fading stairway crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara raises the ring to knock, crystallizing the shift from isolation to communion, with the cost legible in the dimming starlight and encroaching hunger. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (ring, ash, breath) until the threshold’s collapse forces reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Elara; where: ruined chapel; when: three years post-isolation). The cost—risking her own breath to teach another—is unmistakable in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalating via sensory density and symbolic convergence rather than causal chain. Orientation is immediate: Leo, mushroom farm, night—all anchored by line 3. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: pain crystallizes into diamonds, reweighting suffering as generative. Cost is legible in Leo’s vanished debt-burden and the bolt’s disappearance, though the quantum mechanics remain ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty was a prison, not an empire—a revelation that reweights every prior image with devastating clarity. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with golden shadows, vibrations, and silence deepening into meaning.

Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered artifacts (dust patterns, button, drawing) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias redefines his role from passive archivist to active witness, with the cost being his continued immersion in institutional grief. The ledger’s dust swipe provides early causality, and every discovery tightens thematic pressure. The ending’s quiet click seals a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, burden acknowledged, purpose renewed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: for ninety seconds, erased history reappears, reweighting reality for thousands. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through layered details (puddles, lagoon, key) until the broadcast crystallizes stakes. Cost is legible: alarms sound, Maya flees, and she remains alone. The structure is tight, with one meaningful deepening (Jenna’s disappearance forcing Maya’s solo action), and orientation is clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures his ritual, foreclosing normalcy with palpable cost (etched worry, solitude), while successfully averting the prophecy’s completion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (mist, light, sound) until dawn’s arrival signals resolution. Cost is legible in the final image: “Each tiny sphere reflected his face back at him—older now.” Orientation is immediate (“cold morning mist,” “saxophone,” “path”), and causality flows through patterned musical resistance rather than plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterned rituals intensify until the Three Moons alignment triggers a Conceptual Repricing—moonstone dust as bridge, not just archive. Orientation is immediate (“ashen skyborne arbor,” “Elias resumed his daily ritual”), and closure lands via Charged Poise: his room becomes infinite, stakes reconfigured without tidy resolution. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the leaf-figure and the irreversible expansion of responsibility. Folklore’s vagueness (“no one remembered quite what”) pays off thematically rather than causally, which suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time isn’t measured but revealed through chaos, reweighting the entire premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the pulsing glow, compass tremors, and backward-spinning clock intensify sensory density until the pool scene crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible when he abandons his life’s work (“placed his broken clock parts beside the pedestal”).

The Causal lens holds—each memory documented “because” it led to covenant renewal—and the jetty’s submersion marks a Decisive Change. Cost is legible in the final image: his work ends, yet love bridges worlds. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: the cure isn’t an object but attention itself. Orientation is immediate and precise; the disused station, ivy, and cupola anchor who, where, and when by line 3. The closure lands with undeniable cost—Orion relinquishes his transactional worldview, symbolized by bartering sterile moon dust for resonant sound. The plaque’s word “Listen” crystallizes the reconfiguration without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: ultrasonic chaos coalesces into harmonic stillness through sensory density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Kael renounces external mapping for internal clarity, with cost legible in the ring cooling and his prior years of unrest. Orientation is immediate (“blind mapmaker,” “ultrasonic forest”), and the tightening—from fragmented notes to a single perfect tone—reweights the stake with emotional precision. The final image crystallizes transformation without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “the seeds were planted in the wrong soil, but they grew anyway” crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt (loss of the garden’s loneliness), stakes legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring motifs (pen, anomaly, seeds), culminating in cadence shift and conceptual repricing. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; causality remains intact via signal residue and gravitational logic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (camera, moonlight, silence) until the final click crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via Charged Poise—their mission concludes not with recovery but with defiant preservation. Cost is legible in the “weight of collective memory” and the camera’s symbolic burden. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure fits the 600–800 word scope flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each painted fragment deepens thematic density and reweights Elara’s relationship to erasure. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the burning of the treaty transforms fire from destructive to liberating, with clear emotional cost (tears smudging ink, heart “heavy with purpose”). The map beneath the defaced eyes is a well-timed revelation that feels inevitable in hindsight. One flaw: the hidden library’s discovery hinges on coincidence (“half-buried beneath a stack”) rather than earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly: the garden’s hum intensifies through Kael’s drumming until sound waves crest into auroras, reweighting the shared dream from fragile memory to lived reality. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Kael’s refusal to let go crystallizes into a Charged Poise where cost (auroral sorrow) and reward (eternal starlight) coexist. The “hush of the universe inhaling” frames a before/after legible in the final exhale. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Kael understands sound in the labyrinth, therefore he wins the bet and unlocks the chamber. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth “listens”—with felt cost (Kael relinquishes the coin). The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation serves the storm-labyrinth’s mystery and pays off in the central chamber’s revelation. The lock click and door slide provide decisive physical validation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Anna perceives encoded truths, reweighting her grief with felt cost (“tears tracing paths”), while the guardian resumes his vigil—Earned Stasis with visible emotional toll. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with light/shadow patterns intensifying meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“cobalt dock after rain”), and the dental mirror’s payoff is earned. One flaw: the “half-spoken secret” lacks concrete stakes until the end, slightly weakening early pressure.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara returns to the dock transformed, the whale’s song internalized, with visible cost—she’s severed ties to conformity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (glowing scrimshaw, shifting carvings) intensifies until the island crystallizes her choice. Cost is legible in the final image—“the dock was still there, but it was no longer her whole life.” One flaw: the whale’s call arrives via coincidence, not prior causality, slightly undermining agency.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s hummingbird among dried flowers crystallizes defiance in a world that outlaws authenticity, with clear conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring acts (whittling, narrating, hiding) that reweight the stakes. The inspector’s knock intensifies pressure without coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is legible in every concealed petal and carved bird.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael becomes the boundary itself, reweighting the atrium from place to state of being. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory and sonic layering until the hum integrates into his being. Cost is legible in the loss of his former self and the irrevocable perceptual shift. Orientation anchors (frozen lake, cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade) are clear by line 30 and serve the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: Leo’s floral arrangements build semantic density until Lyra decodes his plea. Closure is a Decisive Change—color perception unlocked—with tangible cost (season-long labor) and conceptual weight (a world reborn visually).

Every beat tightens toward the barter and awakening, with no causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orientation is immediate: who (bell ringer), where (lab of lost sounds), when (post-grid stabilization). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, escalating via density of sensory detail and harmonic resonance until closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: the pilgrimage was real all along. Cost is legible—the surrender of seeking for creating—and the final image reweights every prior beat. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off precisely at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (phoenix vines, origami, curtains) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: withering becomes preparation for blooming. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elian tracing constellations of change—as the cost (permanent exile in timelessness to shepherd others) is felt in “his hands still created jewelry that memorialized loss.” Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is maintained through consistent rules (curtains respond to will, coordinates guide the desperate). The final image reweights all prior acts into a legacy beyond biology.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crypto crashes are reframed as ritualistic cycles, with the final image of Elara mapping the next transformation embodying Charged Poise.

The pattern is taught early (grandmother’s journal) and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: density builds through sensory layering and conceptual deepening, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the historian becomes the vessel of lost knowledge. The twilight-triggered activation of the pagoda provides a coherent causal anchor, and the purification ritual serves as the tightening beat. Cost is legible in the “anguished joy” and the irreversible burden of knowledge, crystallized when she walks away carrying “what was lost between worlds.” Orientation is solid by line 30, with clear who, where, and when.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts fragmented hope while instituting systems to contain further loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via patterned imagery (shadows, stone, library) until the final image reweights all prior material with conceptual cost (“hope could never be exactly as before”). Orientation is immediate (“crystalline window… above clouds”), and the river stone’s function evolves causally from discovery to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maria’s decision to found “The Second Chance Sanctuary” crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural lens, with conceptual cost in lost trust and institutional betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya redefines healing from erasure to interpretation, crystallized in the final image of sand-as-scars. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—coffee rings, hourglass, plant whispers accrue meaning until the dawn drive reframes everything. Cost is legible: her own unhealed scars, displaced miracles, and lost patient trust. Orientation is sharp by line 3; causality flows through sensory accumulation, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: unused love resides not in space but in liminal temporal pockets (“editing-room floors of reality”). This insight reweights the entire premise with profound conceptual cost—love isn’t lost but archived in non-existence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seedling takes root in actual soil while divergent possibilities remain intact, crystallizing the freight guard’s stance—nurturing without overwriting. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density builds through recurring motifs (chess clock, “occasionally everywhere,” crystal blooms) that reweight stakes by the end. Cost is unmistakable: his dreamless endurance enables restoration but isolates him from recovered joys like coffee or laughter. Orientation is functional disorientation—“last Tuesday, or perhaps next Thursday”—that pays off by reinforcing the archive’s temporal instability.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory detail and patterned recurrence until the hum coalesces into insight.

Every shard (library, capital, confrontation) coheres under one temporal eddy. The ending image reconfigures reality itself, legible and resonant without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sensory detail, rhythmic patterns, and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot turns. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elias reinterprets loss as transformation (“the coral wasn’t gone… it had transformed”), reweighting the entire premise with emotional and ecological cost. The delayed revelation about the atlas page’s alignment with tides functions as a pattern break that crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate and sustained—no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hum reconfigures rebellion’s meaning, crystallizing her role as listener rather than fighter. Cost is legible in the abandonment, decay, and emotional weight of being the last keeper of purpose.

The stone circle’s activation isn’t deus ex machina—it’s seeded early and resonates causally with her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wave of potential reweights “implanted destiny” into adaptive evolution, with undeniable social cost (defying the New Regime). The Causal lens holds—each beat links via “because/therefore”: ferns whisper → kite found → script decoded → amber unsealed. Cost is legible in the final image: traditions now evolve, but Maeva risks curfew and regime reprisal. Orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)

Cost is legible in the final image: Kael smiles, lighter, having relinquished control yet gained understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful escalation—pressure remains static while the prose intensifies. The closure is Conceptual Repricing (truth spreads), yet cost is asserted (“her soul ached”) rather than dramatized. The “blink that follows surprise” is invoked but never functions as a live constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara commits to publishing the truth, crystallizing options with conceptual cost (risking empire, life). The causal lens holds tightly—each discovery (call, nib, chart) logically triggers the next beat. The “orbits of regret” reframe from celestial metaphor to cycles of violence, reweighting the premise. Cost is legible in the bent nib (evidence of struggle) and the implied threat she now inherits.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: foreign bills, failed ventures, and rusted circus relics layer into a tapestry of human cycles. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—Jasper’s realization that not all cycles are destiny reweights the entire inheritance motif with conceptual cost. The startup arc tightens stakes meaningfully, narrowing Jasper’s options until he must choose between complicity and retreat. Every shard (funeral, train sanctuary, incubator, collapse, return) is taught early by the “paths that circle back” refrain and coheres at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Elara decodes the stars, therefore she understands the prophecy; because the professor withheld truth, therefore trust must be rebuilt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—they choose collaboration over isolation, with visible cost in shared grief. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who/where/when). The midnight clock tightens decisions, and the final image reweights prior isolation as unsustainable.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: luminous detail, gravity inversion, and mist coalesce into a cadence shift that reweights vigilance as tangible responsibility. Orientation anchors instantly (“ancient vellum,” “library,” “fourth quarter-moon”), and the single shard structure fits scope perfectly. One tightening—the hour of inversion—narrows options with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: silence → resonance → return to resonant silence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grove’s quiet is no longer empty but “resonant with possibility,” a conceptual shift with felt cost (fleetingness of song, acceptance of impermanence). Orientation is immediate (“siskin alder grove,” “Eliara entered”), and the pattern of listening → activation → lullaby → departure is taught early and paid off. The final image reweights silence itself, satisfying CR/RR with undeniable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias renounces reinstatement, accepting exile as a new beginning, with visible cost—the fading hope at sunset. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: magnetic hum, twilight, and celestial alignment build density until the final correlation crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 2; causality remains intact through reflection anchored in tactile cues (the stone). The cost—loss of institutional belonging—is legible in the final image of him walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered silences until the clasp yields not by force but resonance—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire premise. Orientation is immediate (“Silen stood in the shadowed workshop under stars”) and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each discovery (“chemical breakdown traceable to a flight fuel additive”) logically narrows options and deepens stakes. Orientation is immediate—port city, silenced town, Elias’s role—and the single scene coheres spatially and temporally. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as weaponized control, with the final image (“questions, not solutions”) bearing undeniable social cost. The causal chain from wind anomaly to biochemical weapon feels inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: wonder shifts from abstract ideal to “tangible force,” charged by the aurora’s final pulse and the cavern’s awakened hum. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering until the ice “sings back,” reweighting silence into harmony. Cost is legible in the amber sheet’s dimming and the bell ringer’s solitary departure; the world remains unaware, implying sacrifice of recognition. Orientation anchors firmly within 50 words, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: failure becomes a landscape to be studied, not a tomb. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory detail, recurring motifs (driftwood, flute), and cadence shifts that reweight the stake of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure escalating through sensory density and pattern intensification rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the frost’s patterns reweight the premise that objects hold emotion, with cost legible in Elias’s solitary certainty (“no longer seeing frost, but a battlefield of yesterday’s peace”). The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 3, and the final image crystallizes a before/after without exposition. A decisive tightening occurs when the prism vibrates—narrowing perception to communion—and the sun’s return marks irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara accepts ongoing sacrifice while threading hope into silence—a reconfiguration with clear cost (blood, breath, isolation). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via recurring motifs (bead, puzzle, loom) until cadence shifts at climax. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten orchard… bamboo forest”), and causality flows through ritual logic. Cost is legible in “fingers bleeding” and “collapsed, breath ragged.”

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the floating arch redefines possibility while Elias’s stance crystallizes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of ritual, recorded data, and layered imagery.

The pattern of collapse → collection → restoration is taught early and pays off in the reborn arch’s silent ascent at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the resurfaced “Chimera Log” reweights Kael’s entire past, transforming rumor into stone-like truth. The causal lens holds—his targeted intervention directly enables the file’s reappearance—and cost is legible in the “agonizing” return and lifelong silence of ghosts. The transition between worlds is cleanly taught early and paid off structurally, with the shard’s inert state confirming irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned objects (letters, sea glass, stones) and sensory motifs build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Jonah’s silence shifts from shield to solace. Closure is earned through Charged Poise—the final image of the lit lighthouse and scattered aquamarine light reconfigures solitude as connection, with felt cost in his enduring loneliness. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“lighthouse supply skipper,” “mist-kissed waves,” “tonight”), and the causal chain of letters → tokens → relighting holds without gaps. The sea glass warming in his palm is the pivotal beat that crystallizes presence without sight, making the ending inevitable yet luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images—glass wick, total internal reflection, shadowed headlines—that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: prophecy as ambient influence, not declaration. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Kaelen’s final tweak of the beam crystallizes his role as unseen shaper, with cost felt in humanity’s obliviousness. Orientation is immediate (“emerald lighthouse,” “Kaelen the storm herald”), and the pattern is taught by paragraph two. The only flaw: the “accidental prophecies” premise slightly strains causality but is forgiven by lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated sun-tracking until the climactic refraction triggers a Conceptual Repricing: magnetism stems not from deeds but from attentive presence. Orientation is immediate (“floating rock tea house,” “donor heart”), and the closure image—Elian stirring dye with renewed purpose—carries undeniable conceptual cost: he abandons the quest for another’s story to live his own. The refracted light beam functions as a pattern-taught intensifier, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sorrow isn’t lost but absorbed by trees, reweighting the labyrinth’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through dream-mapping, sextant use, and stormlit revelation—culminating in moonlight healing and golden threads.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each false start narrows options until the third succeeds because of prior failures. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Emmie holds evidence but chooses to preserve the truce, crystallizing her stance with conceptual cost (justice deferred for community survival). The “sunrise” deadline creates tight causality, and the watch fob’s activation aligns with plot logic. One flaw: Silas’s confession about murdering her father arrives abruptly without prior suspicion, slightly undercutting motivation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered synesthetic signals (taste, light, weather) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: carrying weather is reframed as Earth’s embrace. Cost is legible in Elara’s irreversible loss of skepticism—a cognitive and emotional shift rendered through bodily transformation (“no longer skeptical”).

Orientation is immediate (“glass-domed desert rose farm,” “three solar cycles”), and the single shard structure tightens cleanly toward the dawn climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns of echoes, listening, and unlocked spaces deepen toward closure. Orientation is solid by line 30—Elias, courtyard, dawn. The locket-note-mailbox-archive chain builds coherently, though Mrs. Leclair’s off-stage illness risks convenience. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mailbox’s opening reweights “listening” from personal curiosity to communal healing, with visible cost (years of undelivered letters, her isolation). However, the archival discovery leans on coincidence rather than Elias’s causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the mentor’s consciousness is freed, the spider web dissolves, and a phoenix image confirms success—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights digital imprisonment as defeatable. The causal chain (dice + journal + dance → decryption) holds, and the 30-minute countdown creates tight, coherent escalation. Cost is legible in urgency and risk, though the guards’ trance borders on convenient. Orientation is immediate and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: memories aren’t gone but trapped in gravitational folds, reweighting loss as transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the truth about corporate negligence reweights the *Northern Star*’s loss from tragedy to crime, with tangible social cost (investigation launched, families informed). The causal lens holds—Elara’s dream-weaving directly triggers the director’s action—and the shrine setting anchors orientation by line 3. Cost is legible in Elara’s exhaustion and the spirit’s dissolution into starlight. One tightening (dreams growing urgent) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail and recurring motifs until the loom revelation crystallizes meaning—a valid Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (dawn approaching, paths fading). Orientation is immediate: Elara on the parapet after rain, during firefly season. The closure lands with undeniable resonance: she returns changed, perception altered, stakes fulfilled. Cost is legible in the fading fireflies and silent stones—ephemeral beauty witnessed, not possessed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory density and memory fragments rather than causal turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara steps into light, reconfigured by revelation—but the cost remains abstract; we’re told she’s “free,” yet no tangible sacrifice or irreversible loss is dramatized on the page. The inscription *They walk among us* introduces intrigue but functions more as mood than meaningful constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each revelation (“This is a reversal,” the photosensitive trigger) directly narrows Elias’s options and escalates stakes. Orientation is immediate—“Chaplain Elias Thorne knelt… in the antique music box repair shop”—and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias forecloses Silas’s posthumous revenge by enabling Anja’s disarmament, with clear conceptual cost (his trust was weaponized).

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the couple’s synchronized departure reconfigures their relational stance with implied emotional cost. However, causality falters—the sentinel’s interventions (letter drop, leaf patterns) function as magical coincidence rather than motivated action under a coherent drive lens. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, but the “because/therefore” chain is weak; resolution stems from atmospheric suggestion, not pressure-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs (fog, chalk, vibration) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias doesn’t “solve” his condition but achieves a moment of lucid action—drawing the thrum of aging onto metal—making legible the cost of his pursuit (ephemerality as both medium and message). Orientation is immediate (“fog sculpture garden,” “Elias, junkyard prophet”) and disorientation serves closure: his mental fog mirrors atmospheric fog, both lifting just enough for the decisive act. The chalk X on copper and final chalk lines reweight all prior fragments into a coherent ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael accepts chaos as usable energy, stabilizing orbit through surrender to ephemerality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: shadows aren’t lost but exiled, reweighting the world’s rules with undeniable cost (the world remains broken, work continues). The Causal lens holds—each action triggers the next (“inserted the key… hummed… corrected orbits… fissure widened”). Cost is legible in the final image: Elara slumped, key cooling, yet smiling—endurance with exhaustion. Orientation is crisp by line 30 (“floating isle,” “nocturnal observatory,” “after the world fractured”).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (tooth, bone setting, starlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: certainty isn’t restored but expanded into understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory motifs (moonlight, song, vine, cricket) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sacred is restored via song, not ritual. Closure is earned—Elias’s work succeeds, the arbor responds, and silence is remedied—with felt cost (years of solitude, emotional burden lifted). The “gathering hush” deepens into a hymn, marking a before/after legible through atmosphere and image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the luminous heartbeat map crystallizes options for future alchemists, reconfiguring ephemeral light into permanent guidance with conceptual cost—the necessity of such maps implies inevitable future darkness. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via ritual layering (glass, plate, starlight), culminating in a cadence shift at pouring. Orientation is immediate (“subarctic crater,” “Kaelen,” “seventeen years”), and causality remains intact within the established metaphysical rules. Cost is legible in the resin seal: preservation demands sacrifice of immediacy for posterity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory detail and echo-patterns until the timer’s activation crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the storage crystal reweights the entire premise by proving wonder can be preserved as emotional architecture. Cost is legible in the “wounded season” and the irreversible loss implied by “something was always lost in healing.” Orientation is immediate (“Elian... stood in a marble cavern”), and the pattern of light/echo mapping pays off cleanly at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered silence, starlight alignment, and burden collection until the resonant reconfiguration of Elara into a vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing where “equations for hope” emerge from water tracing floor patterns. Closure lands decisively—the terminal shifts from mausoleum to workshop—with conceptual cost (abandonment transformed, not erased). Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport terminal”), and the lens holds coherently. The only flaw: the inciting object (sextant) lacks explicit causal linkage to the water system’s mechanics, slightly weakening the “because” chain.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian reclaims time not by resuming music but by integrating his dream into present silence—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (thirty years lost, now reframed).

Every beat tightens the thematic weave; nothing is extraneous.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure: the flawed genesis is undone not by repair but by beautiful destruction, with Kael’s death as the felt cost. Orientation is immediate—Prince Kael, suspended palace, crystalline floors—and the causal chain (egg → device → bird → collapse) holds under a Hybrid lens leaning Causal. The stalactite anchors snapping provides physical consequence, and the bird’s emergence reweights the entire premise. Every beat tightens toward this irreversible, resonant end.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sensory breadcrumbs that coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing: patience isn’t waiting but becoming. Closure lands decisively—the box opens, memories are liberated, Kael is unbound—with clear conceptual cost (he must surrender possession to achieve liberation). The geese’s flight provides subtle temporal framing, and the sapling-as-key reweights all prior symbols. One flaw: the lock’s mechanism lacks concrete rules, making the “rhythm of patience” feel slightly mystical rather than dramatized, though the final image compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
