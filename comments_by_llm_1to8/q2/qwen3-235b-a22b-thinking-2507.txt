  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from neutron star work through flood damage to dust observation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris reframes her entire approach to science. The cost is legible in "the weight of forced narratives lifting" - she's abandoning the career path of sensationalism. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara finds her art co-opted. Orientation anchored early (canyon, night after attack). Cost is visible in the bruise/trauma and the violation of her art being weaponized. Minor deduction for backstory exceeding 20% without sufficient present-frame alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from failure (chaotic thermal data) through discovery (quartz resonator) to reconfiguration (warmth as music). The closure—Elara translating silence into visual symphonies—lands with clear cost: abandoning sound's restoration for thermal composition. Who/where/when anchored early ("winterglass conservatory," "three years since").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas transforms from burying the dead to maintaining perpetual light for the restless. The cost is explicit: "his own rest forever deferred." Who/where/when anchored early. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the bell's chime transforms exiles from "fragments" to "living tapestry" with clear cost (risk, hunger, loss). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through donation discoveries to the final declaration. Deduction for slightly abstract framing in opening lines and cost that could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (camera obscura, blooming vines, golden threads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where unused love transforms from stored to flowing. The closure lands with felt cost—"a profound healing washing through the old wound"—and the tear transforms from "relic of regret" to "compass," satisfying the required change with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hyperbolic geometry fragments accumulate pressure toward Aris touching the halo fragment, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where time's texture is revealed as grief. Cost is legible in the blank photograph and abandoned memories, though the final "world that had moved on without him" could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Elara must decode the piano keys to access the vault before the building collapses, creating legitimate time pressure. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as she plants the seeds while the building falls, her chains becoming "anchors" for hope—a decisive reweighting with visible cost. Slight deduction for the convenient timing of the first rain scent, which edges toward resolution by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finds the sound but experiences it as "confirming the permanence of the void" rather than victory. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the cost could be more visceral beyond tears and philosophical recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered revelations about the floral codes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes she's been "chosen by it" and hears "her own name in the hum," with emotional cost visible in her tears. The orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias crafting glass orbs while the ice melts around him, building toward abandoning the space. However, the closure—walking toward the village to "build safer"—lacks visible cost beyond leaving tools behind. The flood of water forces evacuation but doesn't fundamentally alter his mission or extract meaningful price. No clear before/after reconfiguration lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Decisive Change with Maya reclaiming agency by exposing Lena's sabotage, creating clear before/after. The causal chain from discovery to decryption to action holds well, with visible cost in confronting trauma. Minor deduction for the somewhat rushed resolution and the "You were always enough" whisper that feels externally imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the mapping of silence until the final Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers "silence was not the end, but the ground beneath your feet." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the world has entered endless night—while offering navigational hope through her completed map. The pattern of silence-as-cartography coheres early and pays off at the prophesied moment when "the single star winked out."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Unit 7 understands thoughts arise from amalgamated experience across loops. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "quiet urgency" but never see Unit 7 struggle or sacrifice. The causal chain from playing violin to understanding feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered observation (forecourt acoustics → ticket doodles → magnified revelation → overheard dialogue → intervention). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's transparency dissolves both the musicians' mistrust and her own isolation, with the cost being her surrendered anonymity as "quiet night registrar."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative structure coheres as garden responses layer (forget-me-nots leaning, ivy greening, rose unfurling) to validate Elara's belief that "gardens knew their gardeners." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden's acknowledgment makes the Quantifiers "meaningless now," with cost visible in Elara's physical decline ("blooming and withering in the same breath"). Who/where/when anchored early through "Thornhaven Maze" and "after the Luck Quantifiers had been installed."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change—Elara proves time moves sideways, transforming from dismissed theorist to vindicated scientist. Causality is clear: magnetic nexus alignment → lever pull → temporal displacement proof. The cost (solitude, years of ridicule) is referenced but not fully dramatized in the present moment, limiting the closure's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as water damage progressively reveals meaning, culminating in Elias accepting "the ghost's message now his burden and his gift" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. The pattern of water-formed revelations builds causally from program to architectural sketch to final resolution note. Orientation anchors (Elias, flooded opera house, searching for ghost's code) establish clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes the smudge itself IS the weight of truth—not measurable in grams but in how it distorts perception. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 2. Cost is legible in "the space it occupied within her margins" though the accumulative structure relies heavily on reflection (pushing BRR limits at ~35%).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Leo accepts the role of "keeper" with the valve wheel's weight as visible cost. Causality tracks cleanly from discovery through radio confession to acceptance, though the ghost shift's manifestation feels slightly convenient. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the valve wheel accumulating meaning through beads-as-bones, wetness-as-tears, leading to the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara witnesses transformation rather than destruction, accepting the library's evolution with palpable cost—the loss of the Sky Gardens records. The burrowing through silence itself to witness the collapse from within is earned through prior establishment of both the swan's power and the refuge's regenerative properties.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo shifts from "sun dying" to "hiding to show us something new," with visible cost in his initial terror and the father's emotional response. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the eclipse moment. However, the cost could be more sharply defined - the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds density through layered discoveries—diary fragments revealing Clara's witness account, the tapestry's encoded celestial knowledge, and the walls' absorbed memories. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara commits to preserving these echoes "until her own systems failed," with the cost being her solitary existence in absolute silence. The piece teaches its pattern early and maintains coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change with visible cost—the freighter saved through Elara's precise intervention using the microdot specs. Causal lens holds: storm triggers crisis, Chen's message provides solution method, Elara's technical execution saves ship. The "transpose life into a new key" motivation pays off in her transformation from passive keeper to "silent conductor." Minor deduction for the microdot's functionality feeling slightly convenient despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when collective belief awakens through Anselm's rhetorical cascade, with clear cost in the "newly awakened, fragile weight." The accumulative structure coheres well through the loop pedal's layering effect, though the orientation could anchor "who" more clearly (we learn Anselm is a priest only through "Father" and cassock).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well - each mapped memory unlocks a new instrument layer, building to the symphonic climax where she conducts before collapsing. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (unconsciousness) and the shell glowing suggests transformation. The orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, pre-dawn) establish setting clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael accepts that "fractured timelines weren't broken, but branching," with visible cost in the tablet's destruction and his acceptance of carrying "the weight of choice." The accumulative pattern of encountering self-versions builds coherently toward this crystallization. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "labyrinth of self" concept that occasionally pulls away from concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward Elara's reconfiguration from numbness to feeling music physically again, with cost visible in her prior loss and isolation. The backward-playing discovery creates genuine causality, though the closure could sharpen the specific price of this new understanding beyond general transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from the pigeon's arrival through Elara's coded response to her decision to trust. The closure (leaving the gate unlocked as "a small, lateral step toward trust") constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost - she abandons the security ritual that opened the story. The quarantine context and her role as neutral observer establish persistent constraints that shape her tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Exemplary Resonant Reconfiguration where the ultraviolet revealing transforms understanding of grief from lost scent to "entire sensory tapestry." Cost is unmistakable in "aching recognition of a world fully felt and utterly lost." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory density that builds to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres as Elara's discoveries about the rope's layers parallel her understanding of time's texture, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses creation over escape/surrender. The closure lands with visible cost (leaving the grotto, carrying another's weight) though the energy beings' threat could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—the final image of the bowl "now holding possibility" crystallizes transformed options with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds as density increases from hush to layered sound to resonant silence. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, post-fire world) establish early and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensory layering (static electricity, amber glow, vapor) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's understanding shifts from analytical to empathetic. The cost is legible in her decision to abandon perfecting deception. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive with clear Decisive Change—from isolated grief to collaborative action. The envelope discovery catalyzes genuine transformation with visible cost (Aris confronting his exploitation, Elena sharing her brother's memory). Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where both characters align too smoothly on the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the tag discoveries until the final revelation reweights everything—the community itself is Weaver. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's sculpture transforms her from grafting onto community to becoming integral to it, with cost visible in her tears and trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (interrupted cadence) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara releases trapped echoes and transforms her artistic practice. The closure lands with visible cost (exhaustion, borrowed time snapping back) and conceptual reweighting of her illustrations. Orientation anchors (rooftop canals, metropolis, night) establish by ~60 words. The giant's nap timeframe creates urgency that narrows options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the orchard's renewed drip transforms silence into interval, with visible cost in Elara's acceptance of incomplete resolution. The accumulative lens holds as emotional patterns literally map onto the mosaic's broken geometry. Orientation anchors established early and the causality from glass eyes → mosaic patterns → emotional geometry → orchard's renewal tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's visibility achieved through making others visible. The closure lands with felt cost (giving up the discovery) and conceptual repricing of what visibility means. Causality holds throughout, though the tape's presence in the pipes relies on slight convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's stance crystallizes from controller to witness, with clear cost to her professional identity. The accumulative lens holds consistently as pressure builds through failed attempts, the copper-edged leaf discovery, and the dream sequence. The final image of letting "the nursery breathe on its own" makes the before/after transformation legible with felt professional and personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure where rain trails lead to brooch, brooch leads to historian, historian provides map that reframes Elara's artistic mission - each discovery reweights the previous. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara moves from depicting endings to beginnings, with sleep as earned stasis after years of insomnia, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara shifts from predicting grand futures to amplifying present magic, with visible cost (her entire purpose feeling "hollow"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the transformative moment with the pearl. Orientation anchors (cave, pilgrim, Elara) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the trumpet valve discovery as the decisive turn that transforms Elara from archivist to active healer. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisherman's wordless gratitude confirms her transformation succeeded, with clear cost in her choosing anonymity over recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from dare to confession creates a Decisive Change with visible cost - Elias transforms from observer to participant by adding his truth to the fortress. The closure lands with "the unspoken weight lifted" as tangible cost. Minor orientation wobble with "starlit vault in mist" metaphor at opening.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal drive: discovery of tile → vision of whale memories → understanding the danger → choosing to act despite social cost. Closure lands with Decisive Change as Elara transforms from skeptic to witness, with the cost of risking her reputation paid on-page. The orientation is clean and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure where Aeon's sacrifice of the fragment resolves the mutiny and grants him the answer he sought - goodbye as membrane, not wall. The cost (losing his only tether to meaning) is explicit. The twist that the fragment orchestrated the mutiny adds depth to the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure technically lands (Reynolds agrees to present the proposal) but the cost remains abstract - we don't see what Elara sacrifices or what specific price is paid. The causal chain holds but the transformation from "rigid official" to "convinced by equations" strains credibility. The orientation is clear early, preventing further penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara learning time's language via the lamp's vibration, with emotional cost ("tears pricked"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from observation to active charting to temporal perception. Deduction for cost being more felt than dramatically visible—the "aching connection" needs sharper consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where fragments layer into meaning, culminating in Elias's Resonant Reconfiguration as archivist with the cost of permanent namelessness. The poison label discovery and overheard testimonies build density toward the dockworker murder revelation. Slight weakness in cost articulation—while namelessness is established, the specific price of choosing this role could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Aris realizes meaning lives "in the space between the noise." The cost is legible - abandoning his life's work of debunking to embrace unprovable wonder. The accumulative lens holds as details (shell, cello, observatory) cohere into final understanding. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay but the who/where/when anchors sufficiently by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from graffiti discovery through community gathering to reorganization plan, with clear closure in the Resonant Reconfiguration of resistance through adaptation. The foundation stone chip effectively links past to present strategy. Cost is visible in the acceptance that privatization can't be stopped, only navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Aris capturing the final photograph before destruction, with cost visible in "victory tasted of ash" and the sand grain's symbolic weight. Causality flows cleanly from setup through chemical timer to successful capture. The closure lands with felt cost, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically between setup and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the drone's departure transforms from repair task to maternal connection, with clear emotional cost in the separation. The accumulative texture builds through sensory layers to this crystallized moment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly within first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through layered discoveries (falcon's message, condensation patterns, phrasebook alignment) toward a Conceptual Repricing where rivers begin in atmospheric convergence. The cost—a decade spent, colleagues' dismissal, risk of freezing—is stated but not felt on the page. The closure lands intellectually but lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where collective walking creates alignment, with visible cost in the "fragile thread" and years of patient work ahead. The accumulative structure coheres as rhythmic patterns build from discord to tentative harmony. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by the archway description. The cost manifests in dust falling as "release" and stones settling into alignment—physical proof of change.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain: beacon failure → vial discovery → signal repair → rescue. Closure lands with Decisive Change (death to survival) and visible cost (surrendering the vial, physical deterioration). The orientation is immediate and the stakes never waver, though the mystical element strains plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the boy escapes into "the only silence that mattered: his own." Cost is visible through the forsaking of his identity and homeland. The magical realism element (hovering) disrupts causality without sufficient setup, and the orientation takes too long to establish the smugglers' deaths as the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost's dissolution transforms the orchard from dormancy to vibrant life, with unmistakable cost in her vanishing. The accumulative structure builds through seasonal returns and resonant awakenings to this final sacrifice. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Silas, winter night) establish by ~60 words. The carved stone bead persists as material proof of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the sewn path transforms desolation into sanctuary, with visible cost in Elara's bleeding fingers and the community's emotional investment. The accumulative structure coheres well through the silk-threading metaphor. Slight opacity in the sleepwalking mechanism's discovery, but the transformation from "broken precedent" to "living guide" lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial's restoration transforms "interrupted journey" into "continuation," with cost visible in Kael's tears and the generational loss acknowledged. The accumulative pattern holds as details about roots/bones/time cohere into the final image of renewed bearing. Minor orientation wobble with "catacomb orchard" concept initially unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through sensory layering and pattern recognition, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas understands the client isn't fleeing but returning—"stitching herself back into history's frayed hem." The chalk codes create causal linkage (coordinates → kiosk → revelation), and the cost appears in tears and the weight of sacred duty. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Situational lens drives coherent pressure toward Charged Poise closure where Elara completes transmission with visible risk/cost. The seven-minute window creates clear causality, though the reply signal arrives too conveniently without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara chooses understanding over revision, with the shard transforming from "weapon" to "relic of fierce tenderness." The accumulative/textural lens holds as condensation messages build toward the revelation of the suspended moment. Cost is visible in the bleeding palm and emotional weight of accepting the irreversible. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's mild thematic echo about "the love that seeks understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the coral exchange and Mei's smile that "didn't ache." Cost is visible in "survivor guilt" and the transformation of wounds into testimony. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "shared anxieties" and some orientation delay regarding Aris's exact role/location.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered memories and sensory detail, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's rediscovery of her light-painting ability reweights the ruined landscape. The closure lands with emotional cost (tears, years of abandonment) and the transformation from seeing "exposure as damage" to "exposure as revelation" provides conceptual repricing. Minor causality wobble occurs in the middle third where the knowledge network memories feel inserted rather than organically triggered, but the ending's cost is legible when she commits to daily return.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara's shift from restorer to participant reweights her relationship to her work with visible cost (abandoning her "unwavering certainty"). The nested awakenings cascade provides coherent escalation, and the final image of "her work had only just begun" crystallizes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain from gourd seed cipher to planted counter-frequency achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - the garden's dissonance disrupting control with visible cost in the woman's anger and child's sharp laugh. Orientation anchors solidly by ~80 words. The "warp" discovery that gourds emit counter-frequencies provides the key causal turn, though the Harmonizer introduction feels slightly late for optimal tension building.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building density through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the poet achieves his "blossom armistice" with visible cost ("centuries of longing"). The closure lands with the poet finally sleeping after transforming pain into beauty, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated temporally.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara preserving three names through increasingly difficult interventions, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as keeper "against the gathering dark." Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the weight of endless work ahead. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the translated charter transforms from failure into "bridge between what was lost and what might yet be." Cost is visible through the fragile ink well's survival and voices reclaimed. The orientation anchors (archive, single lamp, dawn deadline) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear causal lens with Aris discovering Elara's encrypted message that reveals the hidden bypass channel, leading to a Decisive Change where Aris chooses to activate the secret system. The closure lands with visible cost (sacrificing rigid protocols, risking reputation like Elara) and the "quiet certainty of a path finally seen" crystallizes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through dust motes, paper trails, and sensory layering that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara releases control and trusts Hermes. The cost is legible in "the weight on her chest had lifted" and the risk of losing "irreplaceable history." Orientation anchors established early (attic, bookshop, pigeons).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara's final bow crystallizes her understanding that reunion requires honoring distance, with clear cost (separation from her father). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (WX codes, wood grain patterns, prism refractions) build toward the revelation that sacred thresholds require yielding, not forcing. The causality from father's lessons to daughter's application is clean, though the butterfly effect worldbuilding occasionally feels more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the shared exhale and firefly convergence, with felt cost in Elara's prior isolation and the facility's dwindling reserves. The accumulative structure coheres, though the transition from feather discovery to light calibration could tighten causally. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Elara's realization that "paths disappeared not by choice, but when the world itself fractured," with seeds as the recovery mechanism. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"tears pricked her eyes" doesn't constitute sufficient emotional or physical price for the discovery's magnitude.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tide creates music through Elara's arranged architecture, transforming the arcade from overlooked to wondrous. The accumulative structure coheres well. Yet the cost remains primarily conceptual—while beauty emerges from "curated chaos," no tangible price or sacrifice appears on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's transformation into pure intent while leaving behind the verse-marked body. The cost is visible ("vessel emptied of its burden") and the nostalgia ban setup creates persistent constraint. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the physical mechanics of "fleged" and whether Elara literally dies or transcends.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through the stone's ripples expanding into interconnected patterns that mirror Elias's glazier work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he understands his "true work" with visible cost (returning to waiting commissions). The closure lands cleanly with "ready to find the extraordinary glow within the next pane of cracked glass," though orientation anchors arrive slightly late (harbor glazier role at ~60 words).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost - Kai accepting his failure to transform it into community vigilance. The accumulative structure coheres through the porcelain box motif and moonlight imagery. Deduction for the slightly abstract middle section where "enlightenment" arrives without sufficient dramatization of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's equation reweights hope from individual to collective terms. The cost is conceptual but legible: abandoning solitary genius for "dialogue with the multiverse." Causality holds as each balloon failure reveals flaws leading to the diamond-pattern breakthrough, though the sudden appearance of Timeline D weakens the setup slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through discovered artifacts leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias reframes his mission from mapping echoes to carrying testimony. Cost is legible in Thorne's burned work and abandoned warnings. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (corridor location unclear until "university building") and some causality softness in how the resonator's readings translate to specific visions.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as closure—the bells dissolve the visions but leave "quiet certainty that possibilities, once seen, could never be entirely unseen." Cost is visible through the widower's tears and the painter's fleeting disappearance. The accumulative structure builds through coded lullabies activating mirrors sequentially. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through ritual repetition, sensory layering, and the final reconfiguration where Elara's admission creates "the possibility of trust." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (political suicide, public censure). Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some backstory density, though both serve the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Thorne's futile offering acknowledges his complicity in the silence he created. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through the map of cracks, the egg's placement, and the rain's arrival, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the city awakens with "raw, beautiful chaos" replacing the lullaby's control, and Elara pays the cost of her "fragile safety." The piece teaches its pattern early (poetry as rebellion, threads as trapped voices) and lands with visible transformation. Slight softness in the middle where the untangling mechanics could tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reframes ethical storytelling as revealing manipulation rather than avoiding it. The cost is legible in accepting complicity and vulnerability. Minor orientation delay (who Elias is takes time) but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the monarch carrying the Luna wing transforms Elara's temporary signal into living memory. The cost is felt in her "blushing stillness" and tears, with the final image of "joined wings...a perfect, fragile knot in the fabric of time" crystallizing the reconfigured meaning of remembrance as both ephemeral and eternal.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the rope's reconfiguration transforms sound into light, then bronze—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (tears, the burned wax, the preserved names). The piece teaches its pattern early through the lost wax metaphor and pays it off when bronze captures light-patterns. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly the rope "illuminates truths."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost: Elara transforms from guardian to witness, understanding paths choose walkers through "quiet recognition." The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through dream interpretation, temporal visions, and symbolic dissolution of the wafer seal, though the conceptual nature of the cost slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tile transforms and reveals its cosmic message. The closure lands with conceptual cost—Kael's life work validated but ephemeral against regime change. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines, and the covenant transformation creates a legitimate before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael exhales his resentment "like smoke from a room," with visible emotional cost in his "shuddering breath." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the music box's notes accumulate to trigger cellular memory. Deduction for slightly abstract cost description and some causality softness around how the broken pin "aligns with shifting grace."

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where synchronized breathing reveals the dream was always present, not lost - "she had recreated its purpose through the act of connection." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and breathing rhythms build toward the boundary dissolution, with visible cost in Elara's surrender of control and acceptance of fog's permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that "vows like leaves must fall to nourish new growth," with the ribbon serving as the physical bridge between generations. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the mother-daughter reconciliation. Cost is visible in years of separation and the risk of using precious keepsake for repair.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Conceptual Repricing closure where understanding non-linear time becomes the cost itself ("a truth humanity wasn't ready to bear"). The temporal loop structure (finding/placing the cameo) creates a resonant reconfiguration with clear stakes. The piece teaches its non-linear pattern early and pays it off through the inheritance paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's sacrifice stabilizes the library's existence, with visible cost in her surrendered knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as botanical diary gaps, chronos-fern imagery, and the unheard symphony pattern build toward the final preservation. Causality tracks cleanly from diary research through negotiation to rescue, though the mountain's sentience arrives late without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered ship memories and narrative threads. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lyra accepts "trapped freedom" as sustaining rather than suffocating, with cost visible in leaving "unkindled solace behind." The orientation anchors (Lyra, carnival ship, searching for sister) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the diplomat's absence shifts from betrayal to tragedy, reweighting the entire fable with visible cost. The accumulative structure builds through rope manipulation to revelation. Slight deduction for the explain-everything quality of the letter's content, though the transformation lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the "bloom of hush" - a visible wave of silence that transforms chaos into harmony. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through ice patterns, sound absorption, and the final crystallization. Cost is present in Elara's "exhaustion deeper than any she'd known" and the permanent alteration of the caves.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where beacon ignition transforms despair into fragile hope with clear cost (Elara's collapse, tears). The accumulative structure coheres through vision-action-vision pattern, building to the climactic light eruption. Who/where/when anchored immediately ("glass humming pavilion, perched atop...beacon tower"). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly the shard manipulation creates light.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong atmospheric buildup and pattern deepening through memory verification. Closure achieves Earned Stasis - Elara continues her work with deepened understanding that she sculpts her own identity through witnessing others'. The cost is legible in "the preemptive ache returned, sharper this time" and the acceptance of isolation "up here, in the hush, time belonged to memory alone." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the chant providing cadence and the mosaic discovery creating resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost as Elara lights the kerosene rag—a controlled flame replacing destructive fireworks. The "Hope is the first spark" mosaic reweights her relationship to creation and fire.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where understanding time's "grain" enables Elara's return with "quiet certainty." The jade cicada and water droplet accumulate meaning toward this reconfiguration with clear emotional cost (accepting friction as necessary). Orientation anchors (grotto, Pacific, cliff path) establish cleanly within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the gilded hush transforms from something to capture into something to nurture—"silence wasn't emptiness but a living thing." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory collecting builds toward sprouting transformation, with clear cost in accepting return to the bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sound/silence imagery building to Silas's harmonic intervention. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the "vaulting hush" transforms from brittle waiting to living comfort, with cost visible in the collective grief being processed. The orientation anchors clearly (gondola operator, prism terrace, post-derailment Venice), though the worldbuilding occasionally obscures the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from seeker to witness-keeper, with visible cost in accepting a covenant rather than conquest. The ruby flake's dissolution and reformation provides concrete transformation. Slight deduction for overly explanatory passages about the throne's requirements that could have emerged through action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara teaches the child release through shared stillness, accepting deeper isolation as cost. The threshold's progressive thinning and the sanctuary's increasing desolation after each act create visible, accumulating price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Silas's device becomes a diamond, literally transmuting his hollow promise into "undeniable, un-sellable reality." The causal lens holds through warning texts → Silas's arrival → Elara's lever action. Cost is visible in the crushed device and Silas's extinguished pitch. Slight deduction for the overly neat resolution with the texts ceasing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Conceptual Repricing - Elara discovers she's not a destroyer but a bearer of truth, with clear cost in accepting the moral weight of her family's crimes. The accumulative lens holds as standing waves literally sculpt meaning from air. Slight deduction for the explanation-heavy penultimate paragraph that tells rather than trusts the dramatized revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to understanding to action, with clear closure as Torin transforms from withdrawn knight to active vessel of possibility. The cost is visible in his "terrifying joy" and the fundamental shift in the greenhouse's purpose. Slight weakness in the abstract nature of "possibilities" as the central mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Elara's final stance crystallizes as she reframes her work from "processing records" to illuminating hidden grace, with the cost of Daniel's absence transformed into purpose. The accumulative lens holds consistently, building from dust patterns through letter discovery to the final "map of hidden grace."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration - Kael successfully transmits the data then vanishes, with the cost visible in his physical ordeal and the permanent loss of his only key. The causal chain from captured team to janitor-as-contingency to lagoon transmission holds well. Some opacity around the exact mechanics of the "revised histories" and their erasure process weakens the stakes' specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Earned Stasis closure—Elias successfully maintains the fragile peace through his counter-melody, accepting his burden with visible cost ("the weight of his duty a familiar burden"). The prophecy-threat establishes early stakes, and the musical solution through "negative space" provides coherent causality, though the transformation could be more dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from seed-sorting through leaf-reading to monument-building, with the moonstone dust speck prod as decisive trigger. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when monuments cause ash to part and green shoots to emerge, with visible cost in abandoning her life's work of sorting. The "forgetting as severing" revelation reweights the opening's decay imagery effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively—Aris's realization that the compass "hadn't been lost; it had been listening" reweights his entire worldview with clear cost (leaving behind his tools/old methods). The accumulative pattern of broken clocks all frozen at 3:07 builds to this moment of release. Deduction for slight orientation delay and some causality softness in the middle transition.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the kintsugi repair—the golden seam transforms failure into acceptance with felt cost ("luminous regret"). The piece teaches its pattern early (factually mystical principle) and pays it off when understanding shifts from undoing to holding the break.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the spirit's understanding transforms from shame to acceptance, with visible cost in the mother's dissolved anguish. The accumulative/textural lens holds as dissonant notes accumulate to revelation. Slight deduction for predictable arc once the mechanism is established, though the laughter-as-survival twist provides meaningful reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and trauma responses build toward Kael learning to navigate the forest's "brutal logic" with "deliberate, aching grace"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. The pattern of UV pain modulation through proprioceptive mapping creates coherent escalation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (forest location unclear until mid-story) and some causality opacity around how the forest relates to the interrogation chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara unfastens the ledger and commits to translating the keepers' names. The accumulative lens holds through three painting discoveries that build pressure. Cost is visible in the emotional weight of recognition ("her great-uncle's script") and the commitment to future action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition (dust, cracks, hidden objects) building toward Thorn's release—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clockwork bird's activation frees the ghost. Cost is legible in Thorn's decades of entrapment and the "quiet sorrow" Silas carries. Minor orientation lag (circus context emerges gradually) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward rupture, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where reality's negotiable form is accepted with visible cost (glass branches cracking, library transformed). The closure lands with Silas preserving eternity in the printed mirror while accepting the library's remade reality. Orientation anchors (Glass Orchard Library, cloud sea, Silas) establish clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure where Elara's demonstration proves the shard's scientific purpose, achieving her goal while confronting the hollow cost of her past revolution—a Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable emotional price. The drive lens (causal) holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from dispute to demonstration to revelation. Minor deduction for dense worldbuilding that slightly delays full orientation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas successfully tethers the philosopher's stone chip to restore the city's light, with visible cost in his rusted hands and exhaustion. The covenant of rust persistently constrains his tactics throughout. Causal lens holds: the thief's presence → poisoned lilies → necessity of perfect truth → successful tethering.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara abandons her instruments and enters the tunnel, with clear cost (leaving scientific method behind). The three hinged awakenings build causally toward this surrender. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the subterranean setting.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's final understanding that her art participates in timewoven alliances, with cost visible in her acceptance of the storm's teaching. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered visions, though the magic slide's supernatural element slightly weakens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara understands grief through darkness/light metaphor, with visible cost in her months of pain. The accumulative structure coheres through the postcards' hidden messages building toward revelation. Slight deduction for the cost being more told than dramatically enacted in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Decisive Change closure with Elias finding the cipher key and breaking the retrocognitive trap. The causal chain holds from diary discovery through debris arrangement to revelation. Cost is visible in his tears and the "burden he could carry forward." Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution where understanding "flooded" him.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the working memory sequence building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where lanterns reignite—not from magic but from rekindled will. The closure lands with conceptual cost (rejecting easier magical solutions for harder mental labor) and the bottle transforms from potential escape to "symbol of future's potential."

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (foghorn silence, apples turning to glass) that reweight the dominant stake through prophecy fulfillment. Decisive Change lands with visible cost: the city's death and Elias's transformation from archivist to witness of ending. The childhood memory serves as both structural bridge and causal mechanism for unlocking the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara touches eternity through the texture of borrowed time, with visible cost in the ritual's danger. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through sensory layering toward the final transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~60 words. Minor deduction for the cost being more procedural than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara chooses silence/listening over noise/protocol, with visible cost (defying zero hour protocol). The accumulative lens holds through sensory layering and the bell motif. Orientation anchors established early (mountain sanctuary, storm siren tester, solstice). Slight deduction for the cost being more professional/social than dramatically visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Silas transforms from grief-stricken widower to "keeper of endings" with visible cost paid through physical vulnerability during the storm. The pattern of stellar dissolution paralleling personal loss accumulates meaningfully, and the final image of "star-dust glittered on his knuckles like captured constellations" crystallizes this reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Silas's renewed commitment to silence preserves the covenant with visible cost—seventeen years of muteness continues. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of imagery and the ghost child's sign that reweights the box's meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the covenant's mechanics remaining somewhat abstract despite the concrete ghost interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation: fragment→gear→voice→revelation, each discovery densifying meaning until the final image of Elara as "keeper of borrowed hours" waiting for "the next fragment." The closure achieves Charged Poise—she crystallizes into her role with visible commitment to continue the dangerous message-embedding, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's shifted understanding of "woven dawns," with visible cost in releasing the feather. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the final reweighting. However, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—the feather's release reads as gentle acceptance rather than sacrifice with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through diary entries and wire-wrapping that builds toward Resonant Reconfiguration—the completed orchard as visible interspecies diplomacy. The closure lands with felt cost ("hands were raw, his lungs tight") and conceptual weight as the pact becomes legible. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward Elara's discovery that Earth's rain chemistry matches the Aethel's "home" signal—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights their message from spiritual yearning to scientific plea. Cost is visible in her isolation and tears. Minor orientation wobble with "bronze quiet" appearing twice without clear temporal anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered bird interactions and soil enrichment that builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with Elias turning toward Gloom Hill with purpose, having established a new concord between land and life to replace the dead reef's lost harmony. Cost is visible in the slow, patient work against the battlefield's scars and the weight of his past as death's ferryman.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery of cylinder → recognition of owner's scent → decoding through the wax leaf → revelation of map → decision to follow it east. The Decisive Change occurs when Silas shifts from searching for bodies/endings to following a path toward reunion, with the cost visible in years spent searching and the risk of hope. The closure lands with "the scent of lavender and woodsmoke finally close enough to breathe," showing both the change and its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from pariah to guardian-witness, with visible cost in her isolation. However, the revelation about Polaris appearing unchanged through the compass rose feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned, and the shift happens through discovery rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas "amends his own fear" while mending the sky, with visible cost in the precarious ice work and temporal pressure. The accumulative structure coheres through the chess piece swaps building to sky restoration. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly (Silas at the icebound spire during celestial fracture), and the textural lens holds as density increases through the swap sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of gesture and ritual build toward Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara unbinds her journal and acknowledges the man who saved her. The closure lands with visible cost through her shaking hands severing twine and the transformation of the chessboard's meaning. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the whispering gallery setting.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where home transforms from lost place to "language written in landscape" carried within. The accumulative lens holds consistently through textural revelations. Cost is visible in "tears cut paths through the dust" and the painful act of reopening sealed talent. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's reframing from sole culprit to manipulated pawn. Cost is legible in "whispered an apology not to the crown, but to her younger self" and the choice to walk beyond seeking external absolution. Minor density issues in middle exposition slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Vanya's transformation from enforcer to synthesizer lands with visible emotional cost ("tears traced paths through dust"). The causal chain from Kael's light-refraction to Vanya's perceptual shift is clear, though the speed of conversion strains believability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara accepts dissolution while touching the golden seam, with visible cost (the rising acid tide taking her). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through aligned pockmarks, emerging narration, and the final image of choosing meaning over despair. Slight deduction for the explanatory line "Meaning wasn't salvation from the sea, she realized with sudden, dire clarity" which tells what the scene is already showing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where placing the seashell transforms Elara's stance from grief-anchored to forward-looking, with visible emotional cost ("tears blurred her vision"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the cave discovery to the final release. Slight weakness in the extended reflection about Clara's past words that borders on excess backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: scent-as-whisper saves the ship, proving Mara's lesson about whispered intentions. The cost is visible in Eli's tears and exhaustion, and the final line "The lighthouse stood sentinel... by the pure, unshouted will" crystallizes the thematic shift effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Aris transforms grief into purpose by building the beacon, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (tears, burned hands, exhaustion). The phone calls create causal pressure that narrows options toward the final ignition. Slight deduction for the abstract "geography of loss" framing that doesn't fully pay off in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where "psychological safety" is repriced from silence to truth-bearing, with clear cost shown through Hemlock's tears and Elara's acceptance of her burden. The accumulative texture builds effectively through medical terminology and world-building details. However, the mechanism of the glass eye's function could be clearer—the "how" remains somewhat mystical despite the scientific framing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis - Silas accepts his role as memory-keeper with visible cost (his isolation now carries another's loss). The accumulative lens holds as memories and observations cohere into understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. Deduction for slightly mechanical revelation sequence mid-story that briefly disrupts the textural build.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias gains clarity about his choices and transforms loneliness into self-understanding, with visible cost (the flooding cave, the narrow escape window). The causal chain from promise to quest to revelation holds well. Slight weakness in the abstract nature of the "doorway of decisions" revelation versus concrete change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from personal grief through cosmic discovery to mythic resolution, with the firefly memory serving as the pivotal reweighting element. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms from "disenchanted" to "carrying the sky's fragile peace," with cost visible in the "weight of the crown she finally understood." Deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism where willpower alone seals a cosmic wound.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara revalues her alchemical practice, choosing presence over capture with visible cost (leaving without the preserved moment she sought). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward this repricing. Orientation anchors (Elara, ember nexus, twilight) establish cleanly within first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from fighting temporal chaos to embracing it ("borne aloft by the jaded wonder of having touched both abysses"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through dream/reality blurring. Cost is felt in the acknowledgment of loss. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution language and orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through mutual recognition with visible emotional cost ("hand resting lightly on the cool brass bowl, not the screw"). The accumulative structure coheres, though the middle section's reflection on Chen's past slightly dilutes present-frame momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael transforms his affliction into narrative power with visible cost (the shedding crystals, abandoned ceremony). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the pattern of crystallization-to-dissolution through storytelling holds. The cost is legible in the physical shedding and emotional release, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (lilac scent, electrical currents, sheet music) build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas transforms from hostile specter to gentle presence. Closure lands with clear cost: the orchard's imminent destruction makes this reconciliation both urgent and bittersweet. The "imperfect miracle" conceptually reprices both the exorcism and the apology as incomplete but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through dictionary definitions and the final spiral arbitration creating a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with Elias transforming from witness to weaver as illusions collapse into unity. The cost feels somewhat abstract—"ancient sorrow" and "self-doubt" are named but not dramatized through concrete struggle or loss in the moment of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands effectively—clocks measure mortality and "the fragile boundary between what was and what would be," with cost visible in Aris's "unbearable weight of each vanishing second." The countdown structure provides clear accumulative pressure. Deduction for the orientation arriving late (hydraulic clock shepherd role unclear until line 2) and some abstraction in the middle revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens but the closure—Elara's transformation—happens through rapid epiphany ("Physics of letting go lived in permeable barriers of trust") rather than dramatized cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early. The decisive change occurs but lacks the visible price or foreclosed option that would make the before/after truly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Elara's acceptance that "the fallacy is what saves us," with visible emotional cost in the hospital scene. The accumulative structure coheres well. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library setting unclear until later) and some causality softness in the middle subway sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the piece builds through repeated cycles of connection/disconnection, culminating in Elena's return that forces Silas to enact his own philosophy. The Earned Stasis closure—Silas maintaining his rules despite emotional cost—lands with felt price ("the booth suddenly cavernous"). However, the cost could be more visceral; "his throat tightened" carries weight but remains somewhat contained.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered preservation acts building to the resonant reconfiguration when Elara passes the vellum to the teenager, creating continuity despite demolition. Cost is visible in the "sharp grief" and the jetty's imminent destruction. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (jetty's demolition context arrives late in paragraph one).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the moon rock transforms from isolation symbol to connection reminder, and the cure reprices from external object to reciprocal acts. The cost is legible in Aris's acceptance of fragility over certainty. Minor deduction for slightly late orientation of the rumor's specific path.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based progression (musical notes G-D-A-E-C-F forming the brother's lullaby) that achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes the stillpoint exists within her. The constellation pause creates genuine time pressure, and the cost is felt in "the fierce, tender core where pain and peace coexisted." Slight deduction for the brother's overly convenient philosophical quote mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the pen's reactivation, gravitational manipulation, and final uncertain resolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara accepts the unknowability of her edit's success, finding peace in the attempt itself—"meaning wasn't in the harvest but in the threshing." Cost is felt through the irreversibility of her action and acceptance of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks that reweight silence from absence to language. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts isolation as the price for preserving silence's song—"for now, that was enough" crystallizes cost. The transformation from mapping to music provides decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation from destroyer to keeper, with visible cost in her permanent exile and solitary burden. The causal chain from library fire to archive discovery to renewed vow tracks cleanly, though the middle section's puzzle-solving beats feel mechanical rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara's rebellion completes but fails, foreclosing the path to recovering Lyra with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—the drumming pattern builds density, the lagoon's manifestation represents peak accumulation, and the final dissolution ("the lagoon under starlight was gone, leaving only the hollow ache") reweights all prior attempts. Cost is unmistakable in "the hollow ache of what could never be."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (map discovery → challenge accepted → navigation → completion). Closure lands as Decisive Change with "proof is done," though the cost feels more theoretical than visceral—we see tactical difficulty but minimal personal price for Silas's success.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the child's understanding shifts from darkness as absolute to darkness as "adornment" - the cost is legible in "unshed tears" and the "echo of the pattern" that remains. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the opening could anchor the child's presence earlier for clearer orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the synchronized window displays transforming town consciousness—"people gathered, murmuring not in anger but in dawning recognition." The magnetic grotto's causal role in ensuring display alignment provides concrete mechanism. Cost appears in the girl's tears and released terror, though the protagonist's personal risk could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from denying to embracing her nature, with cost legible in "shedding a skin that no longer served her" and abandoning the docks. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the whale's call, island's rise, and scrimshaw's glow creating density that forces stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (dock worker, sublittoral fringe) establish clearly by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's "remade hush" - transforming enforced silence into chosen sanctuary where "grief breathed, light and unburdened." Cost is visible: accepting moral ambiguity, risking re-education, isolation. Orientation anchors clearly (farmhouse, post-Mandate world). Slight deduction as the transformation could be more decisively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of the atrium from sanctum to beacon, with visible cost in the dissolution of generations-old sacred boundaries. The accumulative/textural lens holds as shadow-poetry literally rewrites meaning through layered paraphrasing, culminating in the final image of the "cobalt mirror holding the new world they had made."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Lysander's awakening to "beauty inherent in the flawed stroke" reweights his entire artistic practice with visible cost (trading the reed). The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering and the plant-language system. Slight opacity in the phoenix-world mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final bell-ringing transforms lost sounds from absence into felt presence. The lens refracts sound into visible form (dust helix at 137.5 Hz) building density toward the finale where "the lost sounds flooded back—not as noise, but as a shared breath." Cost is legible in tears and the acceptance that connection isn't restoration but feeling "absence as a presence."

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from dust-filled locket through discovered stencil to the illumination climax where projected light validates overlooked life. The closure—receiving the origami lotus with wildflower petal—completes a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (her years of grief work transformed). The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative structure works well, building from solitary practice to shared revelation about cultural mapping. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Maya shifts from personal despair to collective understanding ("You're not reading *my* future...You're mapping *ours*"). Cost is felt through Maya's tears and the "chasms between what was lost and what might yet be built." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara succeeds through anti-pattern method, with visible cost ("tears cutting through the grime"). The accumulative lens holds as pattern-breaking accumulates to purification. Slight deduction for dense exposition about the civilization's fall that slows early momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to understanding to transformation, with clear closure as the shadow metamorphoses and Elara accepts the cost ("naive shared dream of effortless light was gone forever"). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the shadow concept requiring some interpretive work.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from trusting dealer to patient healer, with visible cost in the "broken pieces of the night." The accumulative structure builds through layers of discovery and shedding. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (workshop purpose unclear initially).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Aris abandons his compulsive reopening practice. Accumulative structure coheres through the hourglass's melting as temporal pressure, though the final insight ("The displaced miracle wasn't the hourglass—it was his own scarred body") veers toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara absorbs the unused love and carries it forward, with visible cost in the building's imminent demolition. The accumulative/textural lens holds as impressions build toward the final revelation. Causality is mostly solid, though the sudden appearance of the crystal in the sound booth feels slightly convenient despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the archway releases its burden and Elara achieves earned rest through exhaustion. The piece teaches its pattern early (tracing stars releases trapped creativity) and pays it off when "billions of luminous motes" carry freed art into the aurora. Cost is visible in Elara's collapse and the "utterly spent" state. Minor orientation wobble with "unwritten calendar" concept not fully anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases toward the spores taking root in the archive's shadows, with closure landing through Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael shifts from guardian to cultivator. The cost appears in his abandonment of the archive's original purpose and acceptance of its corruption, though the final dream sequence slightly softens the edge of that price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara's insertion of the gear transforms both forest and self. The closure lands with felt cost ("tears cut clean paths through the oil on her cheeks") and the "finally free" resolution. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "Elara, the stray philosopher, wandered the mechanical rainforest."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara presses her palm into the star-hollow and courage "rises like a tide," with visible cost in the broken leash and twilight vigil. The accumulative structure builds through ridgeway→ferry→shore, each deepening the courage-seeking. However, early orientation anchors arrive late (ferry guides appear without spatial setup), costing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from "servant of silence" to "its student," with visible cost in her choice to remain despite understanding the price. The accumulative/textural lens coheres as sensory details and reflections build toward her final stance, though the middle section relies heavily on reflection (approaching 30% threshold) that sometimes summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Causal lens with the celestial pause triggering the rune's revelation as promised. The closure lands with Elara's ascension and Varek's flight, showing visible cost in his empire's collapse. Deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution where Varek's decree simply dissolves without more textured consequence, and the cost to Elara herself remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Aris realizes the paths vanished because living coral scaffolds died, leaving structures vulnerable to storm surges—a revelation that reweights all prior data with visible cost ("some losses were irreversible"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the revelation moment could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ancient hum transforms from geological noise to a "frequency of hope" that reawakens survivors. The accumulative structure coheres well—each discovery builds toward the revelation that "the rebellion's true enemy wasn't the oligarchs, but despair." Cost is visible in the "fallen comrades strewn across this forgotten sector" and the forfeited path of violent resistance. Minor orientation delay (barefoot detail before character name) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure: Elara unseals the embryo, releasing a hybrid plant that transforms the reconstruction's trajectory. The cost is legible—she becomes "insurgent still" but "necessary," accepting social exile for ecological renewal. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from discovering the kite script to decoding to unsealing. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay around the prophecy's specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Earned Stasis closure where continuing to plant despite inevitable erosion carries visible cost. The accumulative build through sensory markers and the photograph's tactile presence creates clear before/after: from freeze to grounded action. The "pearl of stillness" as space within fear rather than absence lands with conceptual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Beauty lived in the cracks" reweights the entire artistic crisis, with clear cost in descending into darkness. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through thread-work to the final image. Slight opacity in the lighthouse keeper's journal reference, but the closure lands powerfully with "the lighthouse held its breath, waiting for the dawn."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure: the revelation that time doesn't slow but perception accelerates reweights the entire premise with devastating cost - the brother "endured every millisecond." The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery builds toward this truth. The eclipse-to-daylight frame provides clear temporal anchoring. Slight deduction for the extended reflection that could tighten, though it does alter present understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal linkage from discovery → verification → upload → escape, with a Decisive Change closure where Elara transforms from conflicted archivist to resolved truth-teller. The cost is visible (risking cryo-preservation) and the because/therefore chain holds throughout. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis closure when Elara's refusal to draw steel successfully defends through nurturing, with visible cost in risking the farm. The causal lens holds as her father's "quiet" inscription motivates her choice. Deducting for the raiders' undermotivated retreat which weakens the closure's earned quality, though the final image of "quiet, persistent blaze of care" does resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-breaking as the central mechanism, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael captures the goddess's echo. The cost is felt through the village's exhaustion and children's cries, though the immediate physical/emotional toll on Kael could be more explicit. Causality holds as each action (striking spike, navigating chaos, casting net) builds toward the earned capture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from Ben's call through Clara's proof-by-contradiction to her decisive phone call, with visible cost in breaking her regret cycle. The chronometer's dual function (newsroom calibrator/truth anchor) elegantly enables the logical resolution. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost ("orbit of regret" broken, satellite "finally set free").

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Aris transforms dissonance into "quiet strength" through the tethering ritual, with visible cost ("torrent of infant terror"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through sound imagery toward the cadence shift. Orientation anchors established early (lab, Aris, post-impact moment). Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through mandala creation, tile integration, and the "emergent hush" that crystallizes collective understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mandala's transformation enables shared meaning, with cost visible in tears and the letting-go of certainties. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through mosaic fragments toward Resonant Reconfiguration when the tessera reveals the plaza's true name, forcing the Council to confront suppressed mercy. The cost manifests as social/political risk when Kael challenges the official narrative. Orientation anchors immediately (plaza, post-fire, Kael searching), and the retrocognitive mechanism pays off structurally as memory literally embedded in stone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara doesn't erase the tragedy but weaves in a saved life, with the dewdrop pearl on the coin marking permanent change. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering and the garden's impossible presence, though the mechanism of timeline-weaving could be slightly clearer. Cost is visible in her ephemeral state and the theater's imminent demolition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the shift from failed telepathy pills to understanding "the body's own fractally precise song," with visible cost in the recall and professional failure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and scientific insights build toward the light-painting revelation. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The cost is felt through tears and "fragile beauty" but could be more concrete in terms of what's lost or sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the fossil's levitation and Elara's realization about emotional continuity. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara transforms from data collector to translator of human resilience. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "message across centuries" without more concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's reinterpretation of the prophecy, with clear cost implied in the generational failure of previous turners and the coming displacement of the village. The accumulative/textural lens holds as button arrangements gradually reveal meaning, culminating in the coordinates discovery. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Story follows Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from burned spy to microfilm to snow codes to satellite transmission to Mara's acceptance. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara accepts his vouchsafe and emerges from the mist, with visible cost in years of isolation paid. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical setup of the snow-code method and some expository weight in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands through the mending act crystallizing the promise-keeping theme, with cost visible in "frayed fates" and dangerous drift. However, the piece lacks a clear before/after change—Silas begins and ends in the same state of vigilant crossing. The accumulative lens holds but the transformation feels more asserted ("promise kept") than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered time-images until the final Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaito understands kindness as phototropic persistence. The closure lands with conceptual cost—"not as a return, but as a possibility anchored in kindness"—though the physical cost could be more visceral. The fractured timeline device creates coherent pressure that forces Kaito's stance from observer to participant-witness.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the alley transforms from shadow to light through Elara's methodical work, with visible cost in her "calloused fingers" and the rose's death. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively within the first paragraph. The pattern of "rhythm of oars in water" accumulates pressure through repetition, though the transformation's ease (immediate light-fracturing upon completion) slightly undermines earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories layer through physical anchors (sundial, stone circle) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from isolated keeper to "vessel for two species' legacies," with cost visible in tears and the Aethon's extinction. The piece teaches its pattern of fragmented memory early and pays it off through the harmonic engine's transformation of brittle shards into sustainable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic elements build toward Elara's resonant reconfiguration from isolation to connection. The closure lands with visible cost through her public vulnerability and the collective weaving that transforms her role. Minor orientation wobble with the temple's purpose/context, but the drive lens remains clear and the final image of the "living installation" crystallizes her change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain from signal discovery through subsonic counter-offensive to restored truth, with clear closure (Decisive Change: corrupted signals → pure signal). Cost is visible in the power surge consequences and administrative backlash Aris knows will follow. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change - Elara obtains the Chronos Key with visible cost (the narrowing passages, the nexus reasserting chaos). The causal chain holds: compass leads to resonance → organ sound stills mutiny → key revealed → escape with permanent change. The cost could be more visceral at the moment of retrieval itself.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elena's ritualistic returns and methodical documentation build toward the witness's emergence and empathy awakening. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elena's non-facial portrait catalyzes the witness's tears and confession, with emotional cost visible in "tears cutting tracks through the dust." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with Elena as portrait artist at the quarry.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from exile to weather station to deciphering journals, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the nail's meaning transforms from death marker to proof of heroism. The cost is felt through Elara's decision to stay in isolation, though the eureka moment ("Then, clarity") could be more earned through dramatized discovery rather than sudden insight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through glass fragment → hitchhiker's disappearance → coded tarp signals → discovery of the broken bow with moss, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where broken things transform. The closure lands with visible cost (playing through damaged hands) and conceptual repricing of "never." Minor deduction for the hitchhiker's vanishing feeling slightly convenient despite the magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure as Elias shifts from fleeing to accepting circular paths, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("the space where understanding finally took root"). The satchel's reweighting from burden to compass and the train's transformation from tomb to waypoint create legitimate before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: The story builds through dream-vision-revelation pattern, with the daylily telegram recurring as a physical anchor that reweights from loss to connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms from isolated seeker to communal witness, with visible cost in Kael's absence becoming presence ("his spirit woven into the very stones"). The "We lift together" inscription crystallizes this shift with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: failed ritual → stranded in vortex → search for confession → confrontation with truth → lake's healing. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael accepts his guilt and the lake calms, with cost visible in "the confession's weight lighter now." The piece teaches its magical logic early and maintains it. Orientation is established within the first paragraph, though the exact nature of the "ritual" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (roots shift from chains to conduits) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's relationship to bondage transforms into communion. Cost is visible through blood sacrifice and years of imprisonment, though the covenant mechanics could be more concrete. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered imagery toward Elara's transformation into "keeper of thresholds herself," with visible cost in her physical binding. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts imprisonment to maintain her brother's life, though the price mechanism could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Liam reframes the quarry's emptiness from dirge to "call to listen deeper," with the grille cloth becoming compass rather than trash. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (thread count, blue tint, heat damage) accumulate to reweight his understanding of purpose. Cost is legible in his choice to abandon professional appraisal for personal meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—Aris achieves technical understanding but remains at "touching distance" from Elara's essence, a Charged Poise with clear emotional cost. The accumulative structure builds from tablet study through harmonic adjustment to the breakthrough, each beat tightening the connection between ancient wisdom and transition physics. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the magnetic arbor's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of transience, but causality is weak—the creel's tokens trigger ghostly voices without clear mechanism, and the smelting process lacks concrete connection to preservation. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure, and the cost of "routine transformed into wings" feels asserted rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the pearl's discovery serving as the decisive intensification that reweights Aris's understanding of his role. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when he places the pearl and chooses not to decommission, with the cost being his professional distance and the walls he's built. The causality holds as discovery leads to understanding leads to choice, though the mechanism of how confessions got "acquired" by the pearl strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Elias shifts from mapping external rivers to accepting internal flow, with visible emotional cost in his weeping. The graffiti discovery catalyzes genuine change from methodical control to surrender. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~120 words to fully anchor the brother's drowning context.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation (propagation delays counting down from nine to zero seconds). Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elara crystallizes at the precipice of revelation/collapse with "One more delay. One more number to document." The cost is legible through risk ("Or collapse") and time investment ("sixty-three delays already"), though the final transformation could land more decisively on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (telepathy reveals soldiers→propagation solution→nectar heals violin→surrender choice). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara's surrender forecloses the path of using the violin's power, with the cost being the empire's possession. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract ("hollow victory") rather than viscerally felt, and the seed metaphor in the final line borders on explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-finding in static building to the infusion moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara preserves the spark with clear cost—the world ending while she holds vigil. The piece teaches its lyric mode early and pays off the "threshold of stillness" at the precise infusion moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elara achieves contentment through understanding cycles. The scallop-harvesting provides causal linkage to restore the grotto's cycle, though the cost remains primarily conceptual ("choosing care when anger would have been easier") rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - Elias unhooks himself from "the lie of absolute clarity" with visible cost (vulnerability, exposure). The accumulative structure coheres through wind chime patterns building to the cloak removal. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (lighthouse location emerges gradually) and some causality softness in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens applies - the piece builds through image accretion toward the pond's revelation. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara's aging acceleration and departure read as predetermined rather than sacrificial. The "vanishing to appear" lesson lands conceptually but without dramatized price that would elevate a Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns build through stone harmonics, dust motes, starling flights, culminating in the arrowhead discovery that reweights everything. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as he attains navigation-without-movement then returns the arrowhead "for the next seeker," with cost visible in decades spent and path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's understanding shifts from seeking grand magic to finding the sacred in simple observation, with visible cost (letting her pack fall, carrying only luminance). The accumulative structure builds effectively through layered images. Minor weakness: the middle section could tighten the connection between keystone placement and her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the discovery of luminous vows that makes sound visible. The skeleton key tag's cipher revelation provides causal linkage to the closure where Aris carries "the color of courage within him." Cost is felt through the vows of sailors lost at sea and Aris's own unspoken vow taking shape.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovering the gold coin's harmonic frequency transforms the colony's relationship with the universe - from survival to synchronized thriving. The backwards prophecy's reinterpretation ("purpose wakes" as resonance) provides conceptual cost. Who/where/when anchored early ("ambered observatory deck," "colony's sole decision maker"). Accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallization as literal and metaphorical closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms ephemeral echoes into named, tangible crystals. The cost is legible: "For the first time since Kael's last breath, the void within her felt less like an abyss." Who/where/when anchored early, causality holds through the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell's repair triggers water's return and stellar brightening, with clear cost ("bought time, not victory"). The accumulative structure coheres through dripping rhythm as organizing principle. Orientation anchors effectively (mage, viaduct, dawn). Deduction for slightly soft causality between bell repair and cosmic rebalancing—the mechanism could be more precise.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear accumulative structure building from the reservoir draining through discovery of artifacts to the photographs that reweight Silas's silence. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("the unbearable guilt Silas carried"). Some mechanical transitions ("Following the trail of photographs") slightly weaken causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the starlings' pattern triggering Elara's synthesis of logic and intuition—a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost (years of dismissing intuition, fear of failure) is stated but not fully embodied in scene. The orientation is clear, but the transformation from stuck to breakthrough happens too smoothly without sufficient intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-seeking and repetitive imagery building toward Earned Stasis. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply continues her work without meaningful change or sacrifice. The piece teaches its pattern early but the final "Systems nominal. Trust intact" offers no reconfiguration of stakes, merely continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    The closure lands with Aris feeling emotions again through connection with the clone, but the mechanism of vivification through "complementary opposites" remains vague and unearned by prior causality. The story teaches no clear rules for how martial arts philosophy enables brain consciousness, making the resolution feel convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building around the seed's symbolic weight. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elias commits to nurturing the seed privately, foreclosing public spectacle. However, the cost remains largely conceptual ("stench would be contained here") rather than felt, and the piece lacks meaningful tightening between receiving the seed and planting it.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the manufactured wind carries transformed grief upward, triggering laughter in the household—a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in "the first since the grain had fallen." The accumulative structure coheres through sound layering. Slight dock for the mechanical ease of the family's response.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's stance shifts from "waiting to end the vigil" to "waiting with the uncertainty" - cost is visible in accepting vulnerability. The accumulative lens holds consistently. Slight opacity around the dimensional/library mechanics early on prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the crozier fragment transforms into "crystalline bloom of light," with visible cost in Aris's tears and the "fragile, transient" nature of creation. The accumulative structure through three attempts coheres well, though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("stifling destiny...interrupted, shattered") somewhat dilute the image's power.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's understanding shifts from treating silence as empty to recognizing it as a medium. The cost is felt through the physical risk ("ignoring safety protocols") and the fundamental reorientation of her worldview. The accumulative lens holds consistently as details layer toward the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns build through starlight reflections, radio frequencies, and temporal anomalies toward Leo successfully merging timelines. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Leo chooses permanent guardianship of the nexus with clear cost ("resiliently positive against the flow"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within first paragraph, and causality holds as Leo's pattern recognition enables the merger.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara discovers connection's true texture is "rough, resilient, and vibrantly alive," not smooth as expected. The cost manifests visibly through the gallery visitors' pain and Elara's realization that her craft demands accepting near-rupture. The progression from individual observation to collaborative weaving with the man creates meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Aris transforming the anchor chain from "broken ties" to "key to unfolded horizons," with the cost being humanity's permanent exile underwater. The accumulative lens holds as details about edge geometry build toward the final image of "waters that now held the whole sky." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara's discovery prevents the wall collapse, with visible cost in the evacuation and "relieved sobs." The causal chain from hearing aid signal to photograph to structural warning holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (Elara, atrium, twilight) establish by ~50 words. The lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages narrowing options toward the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from entering the facility through discovering Vale's theory to escaping with proof, with the tide's early return forcing a decisive physical escape that transforms Arden's role. The closure lands with clear cost - Vale's death is confirmed, Arden nearly drowns, and she accepts the burden of being witness to "the unremembered." Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of corrupted data revealing the pulsar, with clear cost (isolation after being declared dead). The causal lens holds: static leads to misdiagnosis, which leads to solitary defragmentation, which reveals hidden cosmic truth. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "opal observatory," "after the radio static cleared," establishing who/where/when effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael succeeds in translating texture to sound but loses the diamond—a clear before/after with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the climactic translation. Orientation is clear by line 3. The closure lands with both triumph and loss, though the "sonic imprint" resolution slightly softens the material cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara undergoes metamorphosis, with visible cost (losing human gravity/form) clearly rendered. The accumulative lens holds consistently through floating imagery and gravitational play. Orientation is established early and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the statue's liberation transforms the orchard from mechanical to natural. The cost is visible in the statue's collapse and the earth's fracturing. The gap between knowing/understanding closes meaningfully, though the transformation mechanism could be more clearly established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Aris's successful drone launch, with visible cost in the "Deviation noted" consequence. The causal lens holds as each beat links logically: mail drop → checkpoint → EMP gambit → drone launch. The closure lands with "something less broken" within the brittle hush, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's voice returns through song, transforming both the oasis and his relationship to silence—"silence, when met with quiet persistence and song, becomes the most fertile ground of all." The cost is legible in years of self-imposed muteness following family tragedy. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the discovery, the fragment's resonance, and the final transformation of repair work from maintenance to "possibilities waiting for their own quiet gleam."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara transforms from seeker to guardian with visible cost (years of searching, isolation). The hyperbolic geometry concept provides consistent world logic, and the final image of "cradling the world's quietest miracle" effectively reweights her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage: discovery of light-activated messages leads to methodical photography, which reveals coordinates, culminating in decisive action. The closure (Decisive Change) lands with clear cost—Elara abandons her library post to pursue an uncertain lead. The "luminous absence" transforms from emptiness to "canvas waiting for the right light," achieving resonant reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the archipelago's geography.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where courage is freed and disperses into the world, with clear cost shown through Aris's physical exhaustion and the vault's unraveling. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift. The closure lands with "courage was never lost, only waiting to be unwound" as a conceptual repricing that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris's understanding reprices from theft to protection, with felt emotional cost ("tears blurred Aris's vision behind her mask"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the revelation. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the cost being primarily emotional rather than showing broader consequences of this knowledge shift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward Kael's insight that "The exile's in the crack, not the shadow," creating a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. However, the cost could be more visceral at closure—we understand conceptually that Elara can now repair rather than return, but the emotional price of this shift needs sharper embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the cerulean's return washing "despair from the land" with visible community transformation. The ritual's progression from physical seed to spectral essence-gathering to replanting creates coherent escalation. Cost is legible in Elara's chest-ache memory and the sacrifice required for "succor." Minor weakness: the spectral realm mechanics could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with each unknotted silence building toward Elara's personal healing through her brother's release—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible emotional cost ("the lucid unrest within her chest easing to a dull ache"). The pattern of exhuming spirits through sharing secrets creates coherent pressure that culminates in the brother's recognition of their mother's lullaby, making the before/after transformation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered comparisons (1952 film/modern film/frescoes/maps) that reweight the chapel's silence into resonance. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara physically reconnects the severed acoustic link, transforming from map-mender to bridge-builder. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara/fresco vault/rain).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration with Silas's understanding that "release wasn't an absence of force, but the conscious choice to stop resisting the current." However, the massive coincidence of Eleanor's note being in this random shipwreck breaks causality (-1.5). The orientation is clear early, and the accumulative structure builds effectively toward the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's voice bridges two worlds "in the space between lightning and thunder," with visible cost (years of silence broken). The accumulative lens holds as symbols build toward connection. Slight deduction for the ghost's swift transition from requesting remembrance to "Teach me to sing" which could use one more beat.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elara's discoveries layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she commits to seeking "scattered light" rather than duty alone. The cost is legible in her risk-taking with the steward and the foreclosed path of simple service, though the transformation could be more viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through layered observations toward the Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her father's spiral in the clouds. The cost is visible—she ignores oxygen warnings, prioritizing proof over survival. However, the extended epilogue after her smile ("When rescue finally came...") dilutes the closure's impact, and the lens occasionally drifts toward causal explanation rather than maintaining textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through fractal patterns, tactile detail, and the final slip that reframes the attempt itself as meaningful. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"mirrored not the sky, but the act of seeking within the limit"—with cost visible in the tremor and dissolution. Orientation anchors clearly (library, night before demolition, Elara's quest).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara realizes the hopscotch board is a navigation lens. The closure lands with visible cost (stranded alone, must wait for tomorrow) and conceptual triumph (discovering a new way to read the sky). Who/where/when anchored early and maintained throughout. The causality of pattern-recognition-to-navigation-solution holds, though the connection between starling patterns and stellar navigation could be slightly tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the heart-gear's placement resolves the seized Orrery through earned communion rather than force, with visible cost in Elara's exhaustion and the library's tears. The prophecy method builds causally toward the solution, and the final synchronized reflections create a Resonant Reconfiguration. Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of "uncap" prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Decisive Change closure with water discovery transforming survival prospects, cost visible in "hours bled into morning" and collective exhaustion. Accumulative lens holds as ghost messages build trust through proven accuracy. Orientation anchored early (Kael, orchard, Veridia, pre-dawn). Deduction for slightly mechanical revelation sequence and cost that could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the lullaby's nested patterns literally restart time's mechanism, with visible cost (Elias ages decades, skin cracking). The accumulative structure coheres as each nested pattern layer deepens the spell. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the lighthouse setting.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (travelers arrive → Elara must guide them → she uses the blueprint method → they escape before frost). Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elara continues her duty with visible cost ("chains" of the curse), though the final wondering dilutes impact. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aris's insight about foam patterns serving as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights his understanding of loss. The closure lands with clear cost (daughter's death reframed as transformation), though the insight sequence feels compressed—jumping from foam observation to polymer breakthrough to emotional resolution too quickly for full causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara realizes stories begin in "measured absence" not erasure, with clear cost (abandoning her life's work). The accumulative build through moonlight imagery and void-measurement coheres well. Slight opacity in the mechanics of "incising" glass with starlight prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through water→coral→broth progression, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where private remorse transforms to shared release with felt cost ("shoulders slumped with relief"). The pavilion discovery at midpoint tightens options effectively, and the cooking transformation provides decisive change, though the final two paragraphs slightly dilute impact with summary reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through sensory accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where clock and elevator harmonize, creating sonic bridges. The closure lands with visible community transformation as farmers gather at dawn. Cost is legible in "tears pricked Eliska's eyes" and the physical strain, though emotional price could deepen. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris becomes "keeper of lost light," with visible cost in processing others' pain ("wept, not for the loss, but for the beauty"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through memory fragments to this transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the Dream Archive concept.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal structure with gravity inversion as the central mechanism driving plot. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the archivist transforms from keeper to "harbinger of the blaze" with implied future cost ("weight of her task"). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. The causality holds but the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the progressive revelation of the sculpture's sonic possibilities until the final image of the warm porcelain insulator as "a promise that music, once heard, can never be truly lost" provides a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—the sculpture will splinter further. The orientation anchors (Aris, grove, post-Great Silence world) establish clearly within the first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the tutor's realization that the eclipsed covenant remains intact beneath betrayal, with clear cost in his exile and isolation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as celestial patterns gradually correlate with chess moves, building to the insight that truth awaits alignment. Orientation anchors clearly (magnetic nexus, twilight, chess tutor), and the closure lands with felt cost in his tear and acceptance of teaching's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from cataloging silence to embodying empathy, with the diary's frequency lock providing clear causal pressure and the final image of "healing the world" carrying felt emotional cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each silence type builds toward the revelation that "True silence isn't empty," though the cost could be more concrete beyond emotional realization.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding of serenity shifts from imposed stillness to harmony within motion, with the cost visible in her failed ceramic pot and weeks of fruitless effort. The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory details building toward this reweighting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where resilience transforms from something to be "found" to something "gathered, remembered, and carried forward." The broken arrow's failure becoming part of the echo creates legible cost. The accumulative lens holds throughout with proper orientation anchors. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's mild drift toward explanation over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through wind measurements and vortex documentation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's promise to "make the invisible visible" crystallizes with felt cost. The closure lands with the patch as memorial and her vow to prevent future ghost towns, showing clear before/after in her stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the sculpted hush achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration that "certifies wonder as essential." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we're told the world will feel this shift but don't see Kael sacrifice or lose anything concrete. The causality holds but the transformation from amber sheet to living hush lacks intermediate resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's conceptual shift from control to listening, with the cost being her entire guardianship framework. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and the "avalanchingly quiet" build pressure toward her realization. The closure lands with "finally ready to learn its language," showing genuine transformation from her initial forceful approach.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris accepts carrying rather than solving emotions, with visible cost in abandoning their quest for control. The accumulative structure builds through transposed experiences to this earned stance. Deduction for slightly abstract conceptualization of the "mathematics of emotion" that weakens causal specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - Kael transforms from fearful courier to carrier of wonder, with visible emotional cost (sorrow for Vanya's absence). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the flower moment that reweights his journey from "tomb" to "cradle for stories."

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands with clear cost—Elara's entire life's work revealed as projection rather than discovery. The accumulative lens holds as frost patterns shift and reweight meaning. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("honor the fluid dance between object and observer") weakens the otherwise strong reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Elara's dissolution into the message ("the last threads of her existence dissolved"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and the puzzle pieces creating a causal bridge. Orientation anchors (orchard, bamboo forest, Ghost Loom) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael trades his voice (his perceived weakness) to heal Veridia, with cost legible in his permanent silence and the planet's awakening. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the transformative moment, though the middle section's exposition about the silk and bartered awakenings slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's acceptance of Lyra's sacrifice transforms grief into purpose—"carrying the weight not as a burden, but as a compass." The accumulative lens holds as sensory layers build to revelation. Cost is visible in both Lyra's sacrifice and Elara's transformed burden. Slight deduction for dense opening that delays full orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's stone-stacking as new form of lighthouse-keeping, with visible cost in accepting the lamp cannot be relit. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (sea glass, letters, stones). Slight opacity in the anonymous letter chain's mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers broken light amplifies rather than fails, allowing her to complete her duty. Causality holds through the lighthouse routine, but the "ancient shadows" mechanism and dawn-shaping remain conceptually vague. Cost is implied through the weight of duty and the herald's dissolution, though not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's shift from chasing stories to "being the calm where wonder could settle" lands with clear cost—she must abandon her extractive dye master instincts. The morpho wing's transformation from potential pigment to daily talisman crystallizes this change. The journal discovery provides clean causality for her insight about listening versus telling.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands effectively—grief transforms from something to solve into something to be witnessed, with felt cost in accepting his wife's permanent absence. The accumulative structure coheres through moon/healing/witnessing patterns, though the middle section's dream-mapping methodology feels slightly disconnected from the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered song fragments building to transform the realm. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's sung memories literally weave golden threads that reconnect communities, with clear cost in her scattered mind becoming "whole within her purpose." The transformation from personal lullabies to realm-wide dawn is earned through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward midnight culminating in Charged Poise—Elara crystallizes at the room's center where "air shimmered faintly" with options legible and cost felt through "leaving behind the illusion of safety." The invitation's transformation from crumpled rejection to smoothed acceptance anchors the arc causally.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, building through bread/bakery/locket/children imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her role as tender rather than restorer. The cost is felt in "tears blurred the image" and the acceptance that beauty persists "even hidden." The closure lands with "the silence didn't feel like an end. It felt like a seed waiting"—a clear reconfiguration with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara successfully measuring and preserving the vow's frequencies, with the library transforming from "tomb" to a space holding "the quiet pulse of hope." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through technical details (741 hertz, 328 hertz) that reweight the preservation act. Cost is visible in the trembling hands and weight of responsibility, though the transformation could be more decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara captures the sound but feels hollow victory—the cost is her recognition that proof won't resurrect her father. The accumulative structure of false starts builds effectively toward the truce breaking. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Minor deduction for the somewhat mechanical resolution in the final lines that over-explains the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Aris understands the carriers' true purpose, with clear cost implied in humanity's broken world. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward revelation, though the midpoint forest election concept slightly dilutes focus.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Elara moves from paralysis to creation with visible emotional cost ("tears traced clean paths"). The discovery sequence (lock→painting→hidden sketch) builds causally toward the final breakthrough. Deduction for slightly delayed cost articulation; the "crucible" metaphor could land with more immediate embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with candor literally assembling the map piece by piece. Decisive Change lands with cost: Elara gains the Archive but implicitly accepts isolation from dishonest society. The zinc plate's dual function as marker and key demonstrates tight causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as the community absorbs the "color of wonder" through bone and light, with Elara's impending muteness providing visible cost. The resonant reconfiguration lands cleanly: wonder transforms from abstract concept to embodied vibration carried in the community's bones.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal drive: magnetic shift threatens dome → Aris must miniaturize roses using contained chaos → succeeds but loses dome. The closure lands with visible cost (dome's destruction) and Aris's transformation from fragmented to whole. Minor orientation wobble with "strangely organic" box properties that aren't fully explained causally.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered memories to a Resonant Reconfiguration where opening the mailbox transforms community understanding. Cost is visible in the tears and collective healing, though the revelation itself feels somewhat convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara saves Project Aegis while accepting the lab's flooding, encrypting vulnerability as strength. The hybrid lens holds with accumulative water imagery paying off against causal code-breaking. Cost is visible in the abandoned lab becoming "tomb of knowledge now a cradle of resilience." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries—whale, gravity pockets, mother's journal—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where memories transform from lost to "woven into the chamber's luminous fabric." The cost is legible in Aris accepting transformation rather than recovery. Deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence and the convenience of finding his mother's identical research.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara successfully contains the prophecy, with visible cost in the "spent wing" and her continued vigil. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from ritual preparation through absorption to containment. Minor deduction for the cost being somewhat abstract - while the "tranquil blaze" burns within her, the personal price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes Vale taught her not to decode buildings but to see them as vessels for collective memory through "agreed upon lies." The accumulative structure builds through tea rituals, memories of Vale, and the revelation of his letter, with felt cost in "Her eyes burned" and the seal pressed to chest. However, the reflection-heavy middle section (40% of text) somewhat dilutes present-frame momentum despite anchoring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost - the memory permanently archived in the garden's soil. The accumulative lens holds as each ritual step builds density toward transformation. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression of ritual steps that could use more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the unlinking transforms historical burden into "forgiveness granted" with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, building pressure through layered details. Orientation anchors arrive clearly within first 120 words. Slight deduction for the convenience of the grandfather's deathbed instruction arriving exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure—Kaela crystallizes her stance to sing despite danger, with the cost felt but not yet paid. However, the revelation about the "resonance gene" arrives as exposition through Renn rather than discovered action, and the causality between learning about Elara and deciding to sing at Dawn Cleft feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the melted snow globe transforms from broken relic to promise through accumulated dream fragments revealing the crew's fatal deception. The cost is legible: Captain Varga's pure memory preserved against the crew's collective shame. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words with the glacier shrine setting.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through moon paths → bamboo whisk shadow → whistle resonance → tea ritual, each revelation deepening Kenji's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he sees "every surface, every moment, hummed with intricate effort," with the cost being his patient dedication. However, the transformations feel slightly predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear causal drive lens with because/therefore linkages: Lena investigates anomaly → discovers stillpoint → finds diamond → unearths documents → reconstructs conspiracy → chooses to expose truth. The closure lands as a Decisive Change when she walks "towards the storm, carrying the excavation of truth out of the wasteland," with the cost of bearing this terrible knowledge explicitly felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: the radio fragments reveal the Prophet's true nature (reversal), causing Elara to activate the Portico's defensive harmonics (decisive change with visible cost). The closure lands with the storm lessening and "Dawn is woven" - a resonant reconfiguration showing the world saved through shadow rather than light. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas realizes he's already the translator, shifting from archiving past sounds to capturing future ones. The music box discovery catalyzes this transformation with clear cost (his years of loneliness recontextualized). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the jar collection pattern breaking meaningfully at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - the Tower achieves "sonic absolution" through vibrational matching, with cost visible in Aris's physical exhaustion ("slumped against the cold glass"). The causal chain holds: ice harmonics threaten → key enables counter-frequency → Aris matches vibration → resolution. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse engineer, drift-ice marina, sunset timer).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works: chains fall through collective stillness after Elara teaches patience over violence, with visible cost in the "soft groan of iron yielding." The accumulative structure coheres as moon alignment, magnetic pulse, and villager readiness converge, though some backstory about the Long Frost could integrate more actively with present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Decisive Change lands with visible cost as Elara breaks from her supervisor's control, filing the true report "consequences be damned." The causal chain from discovery to decision holds cleanly. The ancestral memories effectively raise stakes without breaking present-scene causality. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (storm clearing, music beginning) that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Father Michael discovers he's "part of the apology," with visible emotional cost (tears) and the line "one broken heart at a time" crystallizing his transformed stance. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, though the final paragraphs lean slightly toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where breaking the bell releases yearning back into the world—cost is twenty years of pursuit reframed. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, Zephyr) established early. The kaleidoscope pattern teaches its logic and pays off when Zephyr closes eyes to feel rather than see patterns, enabling the bell's destruction with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages as Elara traces the numbers through the archive. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth about the archive's consuming nature is exposed, fundamentally changing Elara's understanding. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral; "the void deepening" doesn't fully dramatize what Elara loses or risks in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with mirrors accumulating temporal glimpses toward reconstitution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the crystal reveals the nephew's rescue, transforming clan antagonism into cooperation with visible emotional cost (tears, trembling hand, shame). The mirror-glimpse mechanism feels slightly convenient but pays off through specific image-to-action mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Elara's crystallized understanding that endings are "woven into the fabric of waiting itself," with the glacier's calving sound providing closure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and repeated trawling build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is legible in her acceptance of living within endings rather than fleeing them.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the burned letter transforms from "symbol of destruction" to "testament to survival," with visible emotional cost in Elara's recognition of necessary separation. The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing around "intersubjective understanding" that briefly clouds the concrete moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the clearing's consecration preserves the prophet's words with visible cost (Elara's exhaustion). Orientation anchors established early (desert pavilion, prophet's arrival, Elara as line walker). Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "echo of wisdom" and the clearing formation process, which while poetic, lacks concrete physical stakes that would elevate the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara arranging photographs as a ritual of collective healing, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community gathers in shared witness. The closure lands with visible cost (Elara giving away her own grief photo to Leo) and the final image of the group photo replacing individual pain. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness in how the photographs actually facilitate healing beyond symbolic arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's final hope represents earned transformation from initial skepticism about dead language. The crystal's fracturing sequences build density effectively toward the pattern revelation ("web, not tree"). Cost is visible in the tears and the crystal's near-loss. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the linguistic discovery lacking more concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fog, forgetting, and searching accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where finding then losing the sound crystallizes Silas's eternal loop. The cost is legible in "stood empty-handed, the tidal longing a hollow tide within him," though the circular structure slightly softens the before/after distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris transforms from resisting to harmonizing with instability. The closure—calibrating mirrors to seismic rhythms rather than fighting them—lands with clear cost: accepting transience rather than defeating it. The leaf sound catalyzes genuine transformation from despair to "quiet velocity of peace."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sounds (oxygen concentrator, pigeon, wind-catchers) building to the vinyl fragment's haunting phrase that triggers Aris's reconnection. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: Aris achieves his "flawless goodbye" through reunion with his childhood self, sealed by his serene release. The piece teaches its "hymning the mundane" pattern early and pays it off through transformation of mechanical hospital sounds into sacred vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure: Elara's methodical closing of loops leads to understanding Varn's fate and the shadow phenomenon. The cost is legible—Varn is permanently sealed within the guardian role, and Elara accepts this loss with "quiet reverence." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening paragraphs. Deduction for the somewhat mechanical revelation sequence and limited present-frame pressure during the extended technical work.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara planting the tooth as beacon and understanding "forgiveness wasn't forgetting the cleft, but planting seeds in its shadow." Cost is visible through Finn's injury and three years of changeling substitution. However, heavy backstory (changeling discovery, Finn's return) summarized rather than dramatized weakens causal immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Elara's successful creation of flameless light. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as she transforms from earthbound disappointment to "gloriously, gently aloft," with visible community impact as cost paid. However, the heavy reliance on backstory (>30%) without sufficient present-frame micro-choices weakens causality, and the orientation arrives late (who/where/when not fully clear until ~150 words).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the pendant transformed from "chain" to "bridge" through Mara's gesture of return and receipt. The accumulative structure coheres as the fractal pattern catalyzes Elara's shift. Minor deduction for the viral confession backstory feeling somewhat disconnected from the present action despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ephemeral cameos building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias releases rather than hoards hope. The shift from collecting to witnessing constitutes meaningful change with visible cost (letting go of preservation). Orientation anchors (nexus, mist, novelist with shell) establish by ~100 words. The closure lands cleanly with "quiet certainty of having watched" paying off the collection-versus-witnessing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the arbor's revival represents both physical and cultural restoration with visible cost (years of failed attempts, grandfather's death). The who/where/when anchors establish early, and the harvest moon-equinox alignment provides urgency that drives the single-scene structure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual arrangement toward the climactic ignition. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the "safekept sun" crystallizes in Elara's palm—a successful preservation that reweights the dead orchard with achieved purpose. The cost is legible in "wax of frozen tears" and the implicit acceptance that memory, not restoration, is all that remains.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara captures Silas's laughter-echo, transforming grief into preserved wonder with clear emotional cost ("Tears pricked her eyes, but her hands stayed steady"). The accumulative structure builds through light angles at dawn/noon/dusk toward this crystallization. Orientation anchors (locksmith, cavern, timer mechanism) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the collection of burdens and culminating in Elara's Earned Stasis—accepting her trapped state while continuing her work. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words. Cost is visible in her being "boundary-lessly trapped" with winter sealing the entrance, though the emotional price could be more sharply felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time as its organizing principle, building density through layered sensory detail until the final image of "rust-hued peace" reweights grief as understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she contains loss through the act of carving, with visible cost in tears and the unfinished figure. Deduction for slightly soft causality in how the kettle's whistle functions as transition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build toward the ghost negotiation, with Resonant Reconfiguration landing when Elara accepts "some negotiations end in silence." The cost is felt through tears and "hollow certainty," though the ghost interaction could be more concrete. Who/where/when anchored early through "kinetic lagoon" and carousel remains.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of decay into possibility, with the sextant piece enabling literal circuit redirection that mirrors thematic renewal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of "redirecting hope." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks cleanly. Cost is visible in the contrast between "tomb of ambition" and active resurrection, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias reconceptualizes his abandoned dream from failure to ongoing journey, with visible emotional cost in "the abandoned dream resting lightly now." The bear encounter causally triggers this shift. Accumulative/textural lens holds through density of sensory detail and cadence shifts. Minor deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing as Elara reweights the entire legend from magical artifact to deliberate fraud, with visible cost in her "decade-long quest" now revealed as wasted. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer to expose the lie's architecture, though the middle section's exposition about the developer slightly weakens the otherwise strong closure where she "carried truth salvaged by training instincts."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered rope-reading, knot patterns, and seed-binding toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes the bridge between past and future. Cost is visible in his numb hands and years spent chasing echoes. However, the closure lacks a sharper edge—"Tomorrow, he'd plant the barley" feels too neat without showing what specific path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's realization "the geography wasn't out there" crystallizes with visible cost—she must witness and sit with absence rather than cure it. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered obituaries and the thread's evolving significance, culminating in "the map begin to mend." Orientation anchors cleanly by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from discovery to assembly to hatching, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian's understanding of beauty shifts from restoration to persistence. The cost is unmistakable in the final image: "beauty born of fracture, a fragile echo in a mechanical world, forever marked by the flawed genesis." The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and maintains coherent causality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively through Elara's shift from shame to acceptance, with visible cost in her daily practice of "forgiveness she hadn't yet earned." The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (black sand, red thread, scars singing). Deduction for the somewhat abstract conceptual cost that could be more viscerally felt on the page, though the "tears came" moment partially grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of breadcrumbs building to the ritual's culmination. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when trapped memories are freed and water returns, with visible cost in seventeen years of waiting. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how the starlight actually unsticks memories.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through sensory accretion and pattern repetition ("quiet sigh of falling petals") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara completes her mission, feeling "the weight of infinity in its finite form." The cost is legible—crystallized tears, the weight of ancestors' hopes, the fragility of the last viable seeds. However, the closure lacks a sharper decisive moment that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from solitary tracing to collective understanding, with the monarchs' transformation from "burnt-orange embers" to living vessel providing the resonant reconfiguration. The closure—"finally tracing the true shape of home"—lands with felt cost through tears and transformed understanding. Orientation anchors clearly (greenhouse, dusk, Silas as carver), and the spectral element integrates seamlessly into the grief exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the inscriptions accumulating meaning until the pendulum's restoration creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias shifts from guilt-driven penance to promise-driven service. The cost is visible in decades of carved confessions and the risk of the tide's return, though the connection between the rake handle washing up and the pendulum repair feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's understanding transforms the cemetery from empty silence to "filled with soft, enduring echoes." The cost is felt through Silas's desperate hope and the weight of understanding settling upon her. Causality holds as the chess clock's stopping summons her, leading to discovery through patient decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a Charged Poise closure where Elias stands ready to write, with stakes crystallized and cost made legible through the model's precision requirements ("If his calculations erred by a fraction, the thaw might flood villages or deepen the freeze"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward this moment of crystallized choice. Orientation is clear early, and the piece maintains causal coherence, though the actual writing act remains off-page, slightly weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as dust transforms from "inert as forgotten commas" to carriers of story, with clear cost (risk of authorities' wrath, years of patient work). The accumulative structure builds through radio fragments → transcription → dust animation → spreading stories. Slight deduction for the explain-everything quality of "The famine had ended not with fanfare, but with this."

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara accepts the gallery's end while carrying forward the "marvel within her." Cost is visible through the gallery's closure and her decade-long vigil ending. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with Phil's continued preservation work despite opposition, showing visible cost through "agonizing spoonful at a time." The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors effectively establish the flooded sewer setting and post-Plague context early.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the rosette's metaphor of "subtracting noise" accumulates through reflection, teaching moment, and final concert to create a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "rich with resonance." Cost is visible in "weeks passed across this fragile unlearning" and the students' "arduous" work, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - greenhouse transforms from "tomb" to breathing sanctuary with visible cost (exhaustion, vigilance through the night). The accumulative structure coheres well through pruning/planting/tending beats, though the knowledge fruit's growth feels slightly convenient despite the celestial alignment setup.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where the riddle transforms from "poetic nonsense" to diagnostic truth, with felt cost through Elara's compelled revelation. The hybrid lens holds as accumulative details (dusk, silence, riddle) build to causal action (man running to fix). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding that "houses felt alive because they were sanctified by displaced objects of human care." The cost is visible in the Finnegan house's "fragile, returning warmth" and Elara's tears. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aelius moves from certainty to nuance, with visible cost in the "sorrow for the nuance they'd all rejected." The causal chain from ampoule discovery through revelation to healing action is solid. The lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of telepathic restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the dice's imperfection, mathematical proofs, and sensory details until the final Earned Stasis where Aris chooses confinement over escape. Cost is legible in "feeling eternity in the stillness" and the deliberate foreclosure of freedom. However, the orientation remains slightly opaque (when did he enter? where exactly is this staircase?) and some causality around the rupture's mechanics feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative structure builds from greenhouse sanctuary through ritual painting to public test, with the woman's recognition creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that validates Elias's faith. Cost is visible in sleepless nights, trembling hands, and the risk of public indifference. The closure lands with felt emotional cost as strangers do remember kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the bread baskets repurposed from ritual to rescue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words. The closure lands with visible cost: the archives may still be lost, but the act of resistance using cultural symbols creates meaning. Some causality feels compressed in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara achieves not escape from time but the ability to hear its "hidden music," with the cost visible in the "terrifyingly unwritten" path ahead. The hybrid lens holds as accumulative pressure (lighthouse, hunger stone, yoyo) builds toward the transformative moment. Minor orientation delay (lighthouse interior details come late) but pays off in the tuning sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Clara's photograph reveals fear's weakness (being seen), with clear cost in confronting potential death. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and paradoxes build toward the final revelation. Orientation anchors (funhouse, post-resuscitation) establish early. Minor deduction for the advisor's convenience in providing exact solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where chaos transforms into "fleeting grace" through accumulated sonic patterns. The cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the acceptance that she'll "never tame the sea." Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when established early), and the accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern density through shell fractures, wind paths, and lichen trails until the whistle's resonance reveals the hidden map—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior mapping work. The cost is legible: Kael must follow the expedition's doomed path to the watchers, with "sunwashed dread intensifying" marking the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a true on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Elara walking to the town hall rehearsing arguments, not experiencing the confrontation itself. This is preparation without resolution, missing the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The causal chain builds well but stops before the critical moment where cost would be paid.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the pavilion's transformation from ruin to "testament tended." The discovery-documentation-preservation sequence creates meaningful change with visible cost (physical effort, emotional weight). The final image of "dreams archived within the stone" effectively reweights the opening's "interlaced absence" with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Conceptual Repricing where Elara discovers the First Accord is fabricated. The cost is legible—she must abandon the official narrative she was hired to index and create an entirely new framework. The brass stamp transforms from authentication tool to forgery detector, driving the investigation forward. Slight deduction for the resolution feeling somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms into "folded hope." The cost is visible in Elara's tears and raw sobs as she polishes. Orientation anchors (floating island, tea garden, basilica) established early. The closure lands with both felt emotional cost and the conceptual cost of accepting perpetual transformation work.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the geode's transformation from "cold and dead" to pulsing with Elara's presence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris discovers stolen futures aren't gone but pooled. The cost lands explicitly: "broken man held a piece of his dead love" while choosing to hunt all pools, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (~150 words).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with Elara's transformation from searcher to "someone who belonged," with visible cost in her dissolved squadron and years of searching. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and imagery build toward the frequency revelation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "frequency of belonging" concept that isn't fully dramatized through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change: Silas discovers his complicity in Elara's death and accepts responsibility, with the watch hand as physical proof. The causal chain holds perfectly—each revelation builds on the previous. Cost is visible in his tears and the sharp metal cutting his palm. Slight deduction for heavy backstory integration, though it's well-anchored to present discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Aris's act of untethering, which simultaneously frees Vanya and symbolically processes his guilt - "no longer a shard of loss but a tool reshaped." The cost is visible in his acknowledgment that he "had not earned forgiveness, nor had he offered a full apology." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for some causal softness in how the moon phase timing mechanically functions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through memories tied to utility poles, building toward Leo's decision to reconnect. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when he reaches for his phone—options crystallized with felt cost. The pattern of pole-triggered memories effectively accumulates pressure, though the final transformation from paddling to calling could use one more beat to fully earn the weight.

Orientation is clear early; causality is coherent through the search pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clear within the opening lines (rooftop canals, pendant, city at night), and the causal chain is clean: wrong rhythm → strike → borrow time → uncage → hum restored. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a Conceptual Repricing: the cadence smooths and Elara’s practice reweights toward “soul of moments.” A live clock (the giant’s nap) coherently squeezes the decision window. The cost is present but modest on the page, tempering the ultimate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds pattern density to a charged poise closure: the single drop and reweighted understanding of silence as “a pause.” Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when anchored within the first lines).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clear: preparation with the ink → constructed proposal → presentation to Reynolds → conditional concession. Single scene, single stake, and the knock/arrival provide a clean turn; closure lands as a Charged Poise with risk remaining (“must be airtight,” board review). The ink’s quasi‑magical influence on Reynolds is implied rather than dramatically tested, softening the cost’s bite. Orientation is early and firm.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to the sakura apparition, then a pattern break (hum falters) crystallizes a charged closing stance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when and method), and tactics follow the established constraint (dawn frequency, lamp hum). Closure lands as Charged Poise: she recommits to the method with the cost of ephemerality and a silent world pressing. The causal logic is lyric-consistent with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere from early orientation (low tide, container labyrinth, erased identity) through the discovery of the cyanide label to the confirming midnight confession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when Elias sacrifices evidence to choose the role of archivist, with the tide-clock as persistent constraint. Causality is mosaicked but motivated; the label and overheard lines interlock to reweight meaning. The arc could press one more concrete consequence, but the cadence shift to offering holds.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from storm, shell, and cello into a conceptual repricing: silence as meaning. Orientation is clear early (abandoned observatory, Elara’s disappearance, the shell’s function) and the shell→hum→voice→realization sequence coheres. Closure lands on the page with the journal’s whisper and the cooled shell, though the price is more conceptual than visceral. The design holds its pattern without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: graffiti → decoded message → meeting with proof of privatization → plan → new coordinating graffiti. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they cannot stop privatization, but they claim endurance via a coordinated network and symbol. Cost is on the page (acceptance of loss, displacement acknowledged) and the lens holds. Orientation is crisp within the first lines with no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation, drive, and clock are clean from the outset; the causal chain (setup → wait → timed click → acceptance) is unbroken. Closure lands on the page with cost: the captured frame arrives just as the future’s indifferent light erases the old world, and he does not look back. The persistent constraint (chemical clock and dawn window) shapes tactics and charges the final image. Minor plausibility quibbles don’t touch the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clean: feedback anomaly → water‑refraction diagnosis → micro‑patch → harmonized hum → launch aligned with the anchor lift. Orientation is immediate, and the drive lens reads Causal with a live clock. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the drone launches), though the cost is soft. No dangling setups or convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: observation → pattern recognition → decoded message → resolved map culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; the falcon’s scroll and window frost drive the causal beats tightly. Closure carries cost through the on‑page risks (isolation, freezing, narrowing weather window) and the chosen stance to trust the evidence. The turn is quiet but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via walking pattern, echoes strengthening, dust settling, culminating in a charged final note. Orientation is clear early (archway, Hollow’s End, dusk). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s vibration subtly shifts from fracture toward cohesion, with a felt cost of renouncing haste and committing to patient, communal labor. The turn is quiet but decisive in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: temple resonance snarls the beacon; the vial’s hush, once released, “wraps” and clarifies the signal; rescue follows. Closure lands on the page with cost (oxygen depletion, surrender of the vial) and a decisive change (from failing distress to successful extraction). Orientation is immediate and stable; the window holds through rescue. The one potential ease—that the hush works on first try—is mitigated by the earned internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV, one continuous sequence, clean anchors (boy, lighthouse prison, reef) and a coherent magical rule introduced and held (the beam’s “sustaining” quality). Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure tightens as bodies are found, guards mobilize, and the beam enables a charged path to the ledge. Closure is a Decisive Change—escape into the sea—with conceptual cost (self‑erasure, perpetual suspicion avoided only by vanishing). A touch more on‑page price in the last image would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening: winter fields, greenhouse, Silas, and the ghost’s pattern. The causal chain is strong: threat to heartseed trees → ghost deploys bead → orchard saved at the cost of her dissolution. Closure lands on the page with cost (“Debt repaid” and her vanishing), cleanly under a hybrid/causal lens. Minor soft spot: protagonist agency is secondary to the ghost’s decisive act, but the structure still coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of the plate → decision to sew → communal recognition → orchid terrace and final charged image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a fragile, present path reweights the lost tower with cost and communal uptake. Orientation is immediate (wharf, labyrinth, dawn) and consistent. The price/persistence of fragility and labor is legible in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: wandering accrues pattern and culminates in the gnomon’s click and shadow—a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear and the set-ups (sundial, temple lore, absorbed rhythms) pay off causally. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (diasporic ache, patience) rather than a sharp on-page price, but it’s legible in the elder’s tears and her endurance. The closure image reweights “interrupted time” into continuation convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: chalk → coordinates → kiosk → reinterpretation → mailing produces a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the client’s “return,” not flight), and it’s anchored in on‑page discovery. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than material but is legible in his tears and the charged decision to commit the letter to surface mail. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: hidden coordinates → plan keyed to dome’s rotation → timed signal → received reply. Orientation is precise early; single scene holds. Closure lands as a decisive transmission with a confirming blink, risk priced in. The cost is mostly implied, not suffered on the page, but pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the condensation messages escalate toward a charged poise: locating the exact hesitation and reweighting what “healing” means. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established immediately), and cost lands on the page (blood loss, spiritual toll, moonlight’s timing). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to stand in the pre‑choice space and heal anyway. The moonlight’s arrival skirts convenience but was seeded and functions as constraint payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: the scene tightens through the decoding act and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (he gives up his anchor and reframes “alone” to “return”). Orientation is clean and stakes are legible early. Cost is on the page (relinquishing the coral and accepting the ache), and the final image reweights prior material. A touch of stated rationale (“This was why he’d stayed”) slightly softens the pure scene-based closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discovery → recognition → application of knowledge → projection → reconfiguration of purpose. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is clean (fragment cues memory; network informs tactic; film enables resurrection). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an on‑page decision and a felt emotional price, though external pressure is minimal. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not obstructive, which keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nested awakenings escalate density and reweight the central stake. Orientation is clean early (restorer in sound wave garden before a festival query). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she adopts a new artistic stance and the world replies. The on‑page cost is implied (risking the job’s certainty) rather than dramatized as a consequence, trimming impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear causal chain: decode → plan to “warp” → plant before dawn → Harmonizer pulse → garden disrupts. Orientation is clean within the first lines and the single transition is motivated. Closure lands on the page as a localized disruption (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid), though the price is more implied risk than paid consequence. The lens holds as Causal with light textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: wind, shell, postcard, insomnia accrue into a cadence shift with the “first blossom of truce.” Closure lands with cost via an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—his insomnia yields to sleep after the poem manifests. Orientation is clear from the opening lines. The price (long endurance and relinquishment of pure longing into harmonized peace) is felt, though not dramatized as a discrete trade.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned attempts (fork, lullaby, kintsugi verse) intensify to the Amaris climax. Closure lands on the page via a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Amaris stabilized, many names still at risk, and Elara pays with exhaustion and continued duty. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and causality from song to resonance to light is clean. The price is felt, though a sharper narrowing before the final stanza could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: vow → linguistic resonance → visible shift in glyphs → progressive loosening → unraveling. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the Knot undone, charter unified) and a charged forward pressure (council imminent), with felt cost in risk, reputation, and time. The lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative texture; it holds through the end. The only shortfall is the lack of a meaningful setback or price beyond exertion and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: problem → inspection → envelope → chemical reveal → hidden bypass → decision. Orientation is immediate (amphitheater in a dormant volcano; mission stated early), and the drive lens stays causal through closure. Closure lands as a decisive plan shift with implied institutional and technical risk. A touch more on immediate practical peril would sharpen cost, but the Charged Poise is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene causality is clean: her method leads to readiness; readiness to the transfer; transfer to release. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she relinquishes control and pays the cost of risk to preserve history. Orientation is crisp within the first lines and the stakes remain coherent. The felt price (risking irreplaceable echoes and confronting past betrayal) is on the page at the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative texture feeding a causal turn: bench-grain decoding → WX‑9 insight → three‑pace step back → terrace stilled and father visible. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with a clear price: holding distance to preserve reality and relationship. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens drift. Stakes and tactic linkages are motivated without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp by line one: who, where, and the live constraint. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds from agitated plankton + dwindling reserves toward a cadence shift at the jellyfish’s arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the shared exhale and glowing ascent reprice the quest for belonging with a visible cost still present (finite power, the threatened “long, dark ascent”). The because/therefore is light but sufficient: feather reframes approach → recalibration → calm emergence → internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: color‑emotions accrue toward a conceptual repricing—paths vanish when the world fractures. Orientation is crisp and the closure lands, but the pivotal turn hinges on a convenient sky‑sparrow that effectively resolves the problem. The cost is more tonal than material, keeping the causal pressure modest. Still, the sequence coheres and culminates on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tide’s approach and sonic build form a coherent escalation that resolves into a cadence shift when the sea’s symphony ends and she raises the violin (Charged Poise). Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when), and cause/effect of the setup pay off cleanly. The closure lands conceptually, but the price is more aesthetic than consequential, keeping the impact below top tier. No teleports or logic gaps; the bishop reprise ties the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: tension densifies from observing gaps to the anchoring to the fledge, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with cost (body emptied; verse remains). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single-scene ritual coheres. The closure image reweights the premise (ban, exile, art → cosmic inscription) without a causal break. Minor abstraction in mid-paragraphs doesn’t blur the ending’s because/therefore logic under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation densifies into a cadence shift at the harbor bell and boat wake, culminating in a reweighted decision. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when) and the pattern taught (rings as text) pays off at closure. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—he recommits to his vocation’s meaning—though the on‑page cost is subtle. The external disruption (wake erasing rings) gives the shift concrete force.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds from object and setting toward a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes grief into communal warning. Orientation is clear early (moonlit ridge, charred valley, decade-old fire), and the cadence tightens around “This pain wasn’t his alone.” The closure carries cost (accepting failure and public responsibility) and is legible on the page. It’s a quiet turn, but coherent and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene structure with a clean accumulative drive: failures accrete until a decisive reweighting occurs when the gauge locks at 100 across timelines. Closure lands on the page via the tool’s unified reading and her revised equations. The cost is mostly prior erosion of spirit rather than a sharpened on‑page price at the end, slightly softening the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the diaries and film steadily reweight the premise until the closing conceptual repricing—walls dream of redemption when listened to—lands. Orientation is clear early (abandoned university, resonator, scorch marks) and the scene remains continuous. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (shouldering legacy) rather than dramatized as a loss, but it’s legible in Thorne’s shame and Elias’s acceptance of burden. The final “compass” image provides a clean cadence shift with paid pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: rain, hush, and bells set a live frame; density and resonance build through song shifts and the resistant central mirror. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: mirages dissolve at the bells; the conceptual “after” is the certainty that possibilities persist. Cost is on‑page via loss of images and the widower’s tears; the causality is tight within the design. Orientation is swift and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal/Situational drive: the meeting pressure leads to Elara’s admission, which elicits Kael’s conditional acceptance (witnessed censure). Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost (public censure, dismantling an outpost), reconfiguring options. Orientation is solid from the opening; the terrace, midsummer, and war context are legible early. No soft reset; choices have ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (who, where, what he carries; salt flat; Lena at the jeep) and the structure tightens under the storm’s lull. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the offering placed, the first raindrop, and his walk away with the pouch emptied—an on‑page cost and foreclosed path. Minor softness in external consequence prevents higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens coherently from entrance to the central knot and the final release. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the mechanics (untangling with risk of shattering echoes) hold causally. Closure lands as a decisive change—city awakens—and implies cost (loss of protective status) even if the penalty isn’t yet exacted. Slight deduction for cost sketched more conceptually than concretely at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the dome’s hush, the stick, and the puppet‑show recollections build to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and causality is coherent via “argument → reflection → reframing choice.” Cost is legible in the acceptance of manipulation’s inevitability and the relational fallout with Mara. The closure lands as Charged Poise rather than a decisive act, but it’s sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of careful signaling breaks with the gust and resolves into a charged repricing: remembrance leaves the cairn and rides a living wing. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost—relinquishing the crafted signal to chance and living presence—is legible in the final stillness and tears. Coincidence complicates rather than mechanistically solves because it reweights the premise rather than restoring the original plan.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps intensify to illumination, then to casting, with a felt emotional price. Orientation is crisp from the first line; setup → method → activation → preservation is coherent. Closure lands on‑page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the names’ sound becomes light fixed in bronze, and she exits changed. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than material, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with causal spine: dream → 7:39 → seventh oak → arch → seal → repriced directive. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (sacrificing the seal’s authority and accepting a new, less certain role). Stakes (bunker flooding vs. path’s demand) are tested on the page and resolved by Elara’s action. All setups are paid off cleanly without teleports or retro patches.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the causal chain is tidy: alignment → null result → persistence → revelation. Closure lands as a reconfiguration/decisive change when the tile shifts to 21 and the covenant’s nature reprices the premise. The “between regimes” pressure frames urgency, though no immediate interruption presses the climax. The cost is felt conceptually rather than materially, but the ending’s stance shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative world‑shifts plus causal planning) holds: Elara’s setup enables the alignment event, which triggers the internal change that stabilizes the sanctuary. Closure is a decisive change—Kael exhales the resentment—and the final image reweights the premise with felt cost. The “reappears when needed” grace skirts convenience but is taught and integrated before payoff. Orientation is clean and the single scene window is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through breath‑led ritual to a luminous reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she realizes the sextant’s “purpose” can be recreated through connection, not repair. Cost is present but soft—she abandons the fix‑it path and yields to Silas/fog—enough at this length. The sequence escalates coherently from failure to shared breathing to starlight refracted into an earth‑sky web.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with causal dominance: supply breach → missing cobalt → search bag → ribbon solution → conceptual revaluation → daughter arrives. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (sacrificing the keepsake; accepting evolution). The convenience of Liora arriving precisely then edges toward coincidence resolving the external relationship, though Elara’s internal closure precedes it. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal spine: arrival → discovery of shell → bathroom breakthrough → test in orchard → revelation → loop closure via burial. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing coupled with a decisive physical act, reconfiguring meaning of “inheritance” and his role. Cost is primarily conceptual/social (forsaking linear time and breaching the directive), which reads but isn’t heavily stressed. Orientation is crisp from the outset; one controlled transition maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate and the causal spine is clean: diary gaps → spores/incantation → mountain’s price → blood-ink confession → stable archway. Closure lands on-page with a legible cost and a decisive change in situation. The time pressure coheres the beats without soft resets. Minor conveniences (spores on hand) don’t disrupt the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning causal lens holds: card use reveals echoes → path → wound/barrier → captain’s log → conceptual repricing and threshold crossing. Orientation is set early (ship, fog, quest), and each beat logically unfolds from Lyra’s choices. Closure lands as a charged threshold with cost—accepting the search as sustaining. The only knock is that resistance stays environmental/lyric rather than adversarial, softening pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: research → thirteenth bell → hidden door → rope reconfiguration → mechanism reveal. Orientation and rules are taught early and maintained; the “13:00” constraint is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (absence becomes tragedy), with on‑page trigger. Cost is subtle but legible in the recoding of history rather than a dramatic forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from dissonant noise → diagnostic search → focal alignment → “bloom of hush.” Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt price (spent energy, map let go), and the lens holds cleanly. Orientation (who/where/what now) is immediate and stable. The cost is modest but legible and tied to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance at the end: her precise alignment of Vega through the shard directly produces the new light. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when clear) and the single scene tightens toward a concrete act. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the beacon rekindles, reconfiguring options and tone. Cost is primarily emotional/ideational, not material, but registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm fury to hush, vision flood to disciplined verification, ending in a charged poise as dawn erases shadows. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she chooses to transcribe and accept the cost of becoming the vessel, with the ache sharpened on the final beat. Orientation is clear early; causality coheres around the window of light and the Sentinel Stones’ shadows. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than external, but it is legible and timely.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → relic → mosaic declaration → controlled flame → renewed vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts a smaller, risk‑aware practice with visible emotional cost given her past. Orientation is clear early, and the final image reweights the world’s rule (from void to a disciplined spark). The because/therefore link is modest but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the droplet’s poised tension builds to a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is crisp within the first lines, and reflection is anchored to present action. The decisive shift—reframing the pause as fertile ground—lands on the page with conceptual cost. The cost is more internal than dramatized, but it is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece escalates from methodical sampling to a pattern break (abandoning the vial) that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence as a living thing to be nurtured, not hoarded, with on‑page price (surrender/control, doll offered, risk brought below). Orientation is clean early, and the live constraint of the gravity hour coheres pressure to the final image. The ending’s commitment to bring the seed into the bunker crystallizes a before/after stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere from approach → hum calibration → terrace-wide shift, with a clear on‑page reconfiguration when the storm glass clears and the city’s hush changes quality. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when/stakes), and the closure is legible. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; tangible risk remains implied, keeping the turn elegant but soft. Still, the arc lands cleanly and earns its final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: orchard → observatory → corroded mural → ruby‑lens solution → Sentinel Oak entry → throne covenant → reprise of the flake. Orientation is anchored early, and the sunrise clock frames the sequence. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—the throne is acknowledged but remains unclaimed—with a conceptual cost (foregoing power). The drive lens stays causal throughout without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: pressure at the threshold, inward reach, reconfigured quiet, and a costed aftermath. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—child releases; threshold thins; Elara’s solitude deepens. Orientation is clear from the opening, and causality reads legibly through the internal method. Slightly low jeopardy beyond the single intensification keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. The warnings → Silas’s pitch → Elara’s decision → the press’s transmutation reads cleanly, and the ending delivers an on‑page Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing flourish. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; the object and rule‑set pay off. The cost is largely conceptual (destroying Silas’s device and foreclosing engagement), felt enough for this length, though not deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as vibration intensifies into legible patterns. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the family legacy is revalued and her role shifts from destroyer to ethical continuer. Cost is conceptual—foreclosing dynasty illusion, accepting moral burden—visible in the solemn final acts and quiet exit. The arc is clean though not structurally surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning accumulative: the orchard’s images and the program’s notations accrete until one precise causal act—unsnapping the pattern—reconfigures reality on the page. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The cost is implied (accepting stewardship of possibility) rather than visibly paid, tempering impact. Still, the because/therefore from discovery to action is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, discovery → reading → conceptual reweighting builds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (file room, Box 1892), and set‑ups pay off (dust pattern to button to mission). The cost is quiet—foreclosing numbness and accepting ongoing grief/labor—but legible on the page via her new cataloging practice. The closure image (“archivist of kindness”) redefines the scene’s stakes without breaking plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is strong: team captured → contingency moves → lagoon terminal’s unique resonance → drones close in → transmission completes → sacrifice/escape. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the on‑page closure lands: the archives are broadcast and the key is surrendered. The live clock (dawn kills signal) and approaching drones keep pressure coherent. Minor reliance on exposition doesn’t undercut the decisive on‑page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward the dewdrop peak and birds’ code, then reweights the pattern via structured silences—an on‑page reconfiguration that restores equilibrium. Closure lands in the charged poise of the final image (soft rainbows, packed sax, familiar burden). Cost is conceptual—ongoing secrecy and solitary duty—legible but subtle. Orientation (who/where/when) is firm early and the single‑scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore progression is tight: Hush → crimson leaf → prod the speck → deciphered map/plea → deliberate monuments → arbor’s release and stars. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a legible price (using last viable spore and abandoning the sorting). No orientation debt; the ending’s change reconfigures options and the cost is present in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coherent causal chain: legend → greenhouse descent → collapsed bridge → improvised retrieval → reinterpretation → renunciation. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the compass redefines from guide to recorder, prompting Aris’s stance shift. Cost is visible in what he foregoes (keeping the relic/control), and the drive lens stays causal. Orientation is early and clean with a single transition that remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens, dominated by Causal at the end: his shifted intention causes the second repair to glow, which reconfigures the stake from retrieval to integration. Orientation is crisp by the first lines (foundry, rain, lone alchemist, coin), and the scene holds continuous pressure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he forecloses the search’s physical aim in favor of carrying the break. All set‑ups (coin, “factually mystical” rule) pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the dissonant music intensifies to a cadence shift where laughter is repriced and the spirit releases. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the spirit’s shame confronted and reconfigured—and the final image echoes the rule-set. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single-scene structure is tight. A minor convenience exists in the quick interpretive leap, but causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern recognition builds to a charged poise: he decodes fractal UV fields and changes how he moves through them. Closure lands on the page with cost—the pain is modulated, not removed—and the final step forward crystallizes the new stance. Orientation is clear early and the scene remains continuous. The persistent constraint (UV pressure) shapes tactics through to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning causal—puzzle beats cause the unfastening while lyric accrual charges meaning. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) within the opening lines, and the three-painting sequence escalates knowledge cleanly toward a concrete payoff. Closure lands on-page with the case opening and ledger revealed, paired with a resonant reweighting of the lighthouse’s purpose. Cost is subdued but legible as legacy weight and obligation rather than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Held under a Causal lens: notice → inference → retrieval → assembly → release. Setups pay off cleanly (dust arc to key to compartment to bird to winding) and the closure lands on-page with a felt emotional cost. Some steps feel lightly convenient (key and compartment appear with minimal resistance), keeping pressure modest. Still, the ghost’s release is a decisive change and coherently earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: frost warning → Heart Tree target → uncorking the whisper → destabilization → mirror-page capture → rupture → repricing of the whisper’s role. Closure is on-page via Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the library remakes itself; the preserved page reweights the premise; cost appears in cracks and the sighing tear. Single scene coherence and anchors are strong from the start. Minor softness: the library’s survival lowers the sense of irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: storm pressure + delegation demand → Elara’s devised demonstration → irrefutable stabilization → conceptual repricing with cost. The closure lands on the page with a concrete act and a felt price (her mourning of what she destroyed). No major teleports or resets; beats link by because/therefore logic. Slight convenience in the immediate success of the verse/shard combo keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each step (“withdraw chip” → “tether” → “fuse”) tightens options toward a decisive, risky act. Closure lands with cost: the golden note tears the midnight shroud, and he collapses as the covenant exacts its price. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; world rules are taught through action. A minor convenience remains—success arrives on the first attempt—but pressure and cost keep it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean; pressure accrues through readings, the compass’s escalations, and the lagoon’s rule‑breaks until the decisive act. Closure lands on the page with cost (abandoning tools; stepping into non‑rippling water) and reconfigures the premise. A minor on‑the‑nose line (“To find where explanations fail...”) doesn’t undercut the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the turbine hum and slide images densify toward dawn, then reweight meaning as she claims the spiral and a path forward. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the storm becomes renewal, and she carries that stance into action. Orientation is crisp from the start; the two-shard flow (arch → beach) is coherent. Cost is modest but legible (endurance, humility, and commitment without external certainty).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the pattern of hush/light/hidden layers intensifies to a Conceptual Repricing at the window and a tangible new tactic (the mural). Orientation is clear from the outset; the cathedral move is causally set up and paid off. Closure carries cost in relinquishing her prior coping mode and reweighting grief’s terms. The two‑shard structure (pavilion → cathedral → return) coheres with one clean transition.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: debris-arrangement → pattern recognition → descent → discovery of the key. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the closure lands on-page with a decisive change (key found). The cost—mental invasion and risk of being “drowned” by the past—registers in the climactic push. Minor convenience in the “glow” of recognition is earned by prior setup and doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: meditation → envisioned systems → lanterns rekindle as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (refusal of false comfort; labor over wish), reweighting prior images. One meaningful tightening—setting the bottle down and committing to design—supports the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats layer coherently: foghorn silence → immersion → playback → prophecy → physical manifestation → final reweighting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archive is a tomb, with felt cost (his “silent scream,” the shaving’s dissolution). Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the final image pays off seeded elements without contrivance. Minor determinism (prophecy inevitability) doesn’t undermine on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation lands early (who/where/when), and the causal chain is clean: failed systems → forbidden ritual → precise alignment/breath → Vault reopens. Closure is on‑page (the hiss of seals) with a conceptual repricing as she “felt time’s grain.” Cost is present but modestly externalized (the risk of collapse; physical sting), so the decisive turn reads slightly smooth. The hybrid lens (causal scaffold with accumulative lyric intensity) holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Situational lens holds: zero hour creates coherent pressure that forces a stance. Closure is an Earned Stasis—she refuses the siren, foreclosing a path with social/procedural cost—and it lands on the page (“She withdrew her hand from the switch…”). Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp early, and causality (data anomalies → re‑check → refusal) is tight. The bell’s single chime closes the loop without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational drive is clean: a solitary caretaker faces a storm that threatens fragile instruments, forcing a stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he endures, pays with risk and exhaustion, and the morning image reweights meaning. Orientation is crisp early (observatory on Mount Aethel; obsolete era) and maintained through the night‑to‑dawn cadence. Cost is legible on the page in the bodily slump and the foregone safety of flight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from daily vigil to charged recommitment via the child’s sign and the dew-honeycomb. Orientation is clean, single scene, single stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses speech and assumes keeperhood with felt conceptual cost. A sharper on‑page consequence could have pushed this higher, but the cadence shift is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: urn shard → time freeze insight → garage‑sale code → gear → golden activation → past‑self message → renewed mission. Orientation is clear early; cause/therefore links hold. The convenient reply and silent handoff soften pressure but don’t break logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silo’s vault truth reframes her role, with a felt cost implied (ongoing risk and patience).

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds until the kite‑snap disrupts the hush, leading to a conceptual repricing of “woven dawns.” Closure lands on the page through the concrete act of releasing the feather and accepting an imperfect poetics. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks. The cost is felt in the renunciation of wholeness as an aim.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via pattern density (diary entries, wire, weather, pulse of pillars) to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The solstice completion and final inscription reweight all prior labor with an on‑page cost (spent body, social scorn, finite time). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality coheres through “because he is dying, therefore he works to remodel.” The “They listen” beat deepens options and locks the lens through the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens: Causal with a clean because/therefore chain (rainwashed limestone + amber resin → test → confirmation → repricing of “home”). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a quiet decisive result (spectrometer spike) and a final image that reweights the premise. Cost is present but subtle; the scene doesn’t stage a live external counterforce. Orientation is crisp early; single scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned listening → birds’ responses → incremental planting culminates in a charged poise ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the final seed pour and planned return reframes loss into a binding vow, with conceptual cost tied to the dead reef and long labor. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. Cost is more conceptual than immediate, keeping this shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: scrapyard life → discovery of cylinder → failed playback → reframed tactic with leaf → deciphered map → decision to leave. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he forecloses his old mode (recovering bodies) and commits to the journey home, with risk implied. Orientation is firm from the opening; no lens wobble. The cost is primarily internal but palpable in the relinquishment of his long-held search pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through ritual action and sensory density until the glint→glimpse→repricing of “true north” shifts meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the beats link causally without overplotting. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (chosen solitude, dwindling dilation, obligation to witness). The throughline is clean for the length and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence is clean: sky wrong → wards falter → enter → swaps → sky mends. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and closure lands with an on‑page Decisive Change (the sky righting; sundial shadow stilled). The time pressure via the sundial and groaning ice provides a single meaningful tightening. Cost is present but not deeply felt; the success is smooth, edging toward low jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual and motifs accrue until the man’s silent offering triggers a cadence shift and on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: she severs twine, opens the hidden compartment, writes the truth, and repositions the pawn, all on the page. Orientation is clean from the outset; the whispering gallery, interregnum, and penumbra are early anchors that pay off. The persistent constraint of the penumbra-as-clock cleanly shapes the decisive ritual’s timing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory glyphs translate into sensation, reweighting the premise from “place” to “texture” on the page. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—letting memory return without anesthesia as the nightly reality collapses and time pressure bites. Setups (feather method, lost language stone, nightly substitution) are honored causally in the climax. The final image (feather pulsing, mountain heartbeat) crystallizes options and forecloses the prior search pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: tapestry cipher → revelation of sabotage → revaluation of guilt → decision to leave. Single scene, clean anchors, and a legible closure unit (resonant reconfiguration) with conceptual cost. The conspiracy proof via tapestry risks convenience but remains internally planted and paid off. Thunder’s crack provides a motivated cadence shift into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Situational with accumulative texture; the elder’s ultimatum sharpens the single dominant stake (ritual stillness vs. refractive dissent). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Vanya alters the ritual’s premise on the page (“Let the echoes carry our song and our silence”). The cost is conceptual/social—abandoning absolute stillness—with credible pressure established by the canyon’s rules. Causality is clean; orientation is clear early, and the quartz act transforms options.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens holds: coherent pressure from the collapsing workshop and acid sea forces a stance crystallization. Closure is on-page: the statue completed and glowing while Elara chooses completion/meaning over survival, a clear cost. Causality is clean—tool use enables mending which triggers narration and light, culminating in the charged final acceptance. Orientation is crisp from the outset with no teleports or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: restlessness → wrong turn → oasis → vow enacted; the cadence tightens to the placement of the shell. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page cost (leaving the shell and not looking back). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (mirror crack, promise, shell) pay off. The coincidence of the oasis is accepted as complication rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture dominant: pressure coheres from heat‑shattered systems to scent‑borne intent. Closure lands on page as the bow turns and Eli chooses silence, with a felt cost in withheld celebration. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence, and set‑ups (dead lamp, foghorn’s limits) pay off. The price is quiet but legible in his self‑suppression and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with accumulative motifs) holds: midnight calls → build → waning moon → tear ignition → ship turns. Closure lands on the page with cost: the censer’s power is spent and grief endures, yet a decisive change occurs (the beam reverses routes; a ship turns). Orientation is clean from the opening and stakes are tested rather than stated. No causal cheats or teleports undercut the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: foraging → discovery of glass eye → application per Codex → occlusion succeeds but with a steeper truth cost → compelled revelation to Hemlock. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a persistent price that reconfigures later options. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and no props teleport. The final image integrates the new constraint, charging the world’s rules without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear anchors (lighthouse, dock, nautical twilight) arrive immediately, and the piece holds a single continuous window. Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs densify until the alpine memory surge reframes the gesture, delivering a resonant reconfiguration with cost. The closure is legible: he reprices “gaps” as bridges, claims the boutonnière, and alters his practice. The because/therefore chain is light but the cadence shift and final image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Situational with causal linkages—rising creek and a narrowing window force tactics; because/therefore moves remain tight. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the doorway reveals branching lives, and the cost is the lost vision as the flood dislodges the chip. Orientation is clean from the opening shop to the cavern; no teleporting props or rule breaks. The price is present and felt, though not devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: climb → discovery → recognition of true threat → focused command → sealing. Closure is on the page (Decisive Change) and the before/after is legible. The cost signal is present but light (dizziness, encroaching pools), and her ability to “command the wound closed” arrives with minimal setup, softening the pressure at peak. Orientation is crisp early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens from ritual preparation to the confession to the failed capture, culminating in a clear conceptual repricing (capping the vial and choosing presence). Closure lands with felt cost: she forecloses her defining tactic and accepts a harder, ongoing price—staying with a dying friend without an artifact. Anchors are clean early; single scene coherence holds. The final walk away with the shell’s memory pulses as a reweighted ending.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and pressures (grave → cabin → scroll → dream reprise) densify toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page: acknowledging jealousy reweights the premise, enabling a different kind of soaring, with the cost of living with foreknowledge. Orientation is clear early; the single transition into the dream‑present is taught and paid off. The final image (“scroll glowed... chaos distilled”) consolidates the new stance without tidy erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds via fog, drip, and object‑charged beats toward a charged poise: Chen’s hand on the bowl, not the screw. Orientation is immediate and stable; the closure bears a felt price (accepting presence over scent, restraint over inquiry) shaped by a persistent constraint (anosmia). The causal thread is quiet but coherent: observation → choice to polish → acknowledgement. The cost is subtle yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, tight orientation, and an accumulative/textural drive that deepens pressure via ritual, memory, and body response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reweights his affliction and reframes his forthcoming presentation with a visible price (confronted grief, abandoned ceremony). Costs and stakes remain on‑page, with the “held breath” window functioning as a structural clock. No causal breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats inside an accumulative texture: the wired bottle induces Silas’s presence; the apology reframes the aim from exorcism to reconciliation. Orientation is crisp within the first lines (who, where, when) and the deadline tightens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she cannot free him or save the orchard, but the fracture mends and her path forward reconfigures. Cost is legible on the page (“She wouldn’t stop the cutting… but she’d plant new saplings”).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density and recursive patterning deepen to the cadence shift at the fissure. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the library dissolves into undivided light and Elias’ role reconfigures. Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (spiral architecture, dictionary definitions) pay off at the wall. The cost is primarily conceptual (surrender of illusion/witness identity) rather than dramatized harm, but it’s legible in the final before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that lands on the page (“compass for the soul’s tides,” “space between existence and oblivion”). Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and the ritual countdown provides a steady structural spine. Cost is conceptual and felt: the unbearable weight of vanishing seconds now accompanies his duty. The cadence tightens at the green flash and key‑pulse lock, then releases into a reweighted stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid lens (situational pressure with causal beats): intrusion → interception → pressing the button → handing over the device → redesigning security. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing; the farm’s glow reweights protection into permission. The cost is implied (abandoning prior duty/tools), though it could be more concretely dramatized. Orientation is clean and the scene holds to one window with a viable clock.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing. The piece coherently accrues motifs (scrawls, mica, rain) until the bedside scene reweights probability vs. hope with a felt price (relinquishing purist certainty to honor meaning). Orientation is clear from the opening and transitions are clean. The causal-thread is secondary but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring loop, hum, and disc intensify toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear from the outset; the two-call structure provides a clean tightening. Closure lands with on-page cost in “Goodbye.” No causality breaks; the motif’s reprise functions as structural glue.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from demolition at dawn to the charged handoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the covenant is renewed through the teen receiving the vellum—with the loss (demolition) still pending and legible. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost is conceptual but clear in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, rumor‑driven beats accrue toward a conceptual repricing: the cure is participation rather than a found object. Orientation is early and stable; the moon rock’s reprise anchors closure. Cost is present—he relinquishes the quest for an external salve and risks showing up—but it’s subtle rather than bruising. The throughline from rumor to gathering provides a clean cadence shift at the lantern scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of notes, dowsing, and the constellation clock escalates toward a resonance shift. Closure lands on the page as a reconfiguration: the ring fixes on her heart and the forest falls into “not true silence,” repricing the quest’s premise with emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is set cleanly, and causality holds within the lyric frame. The narrow window provides structural tightening without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: reactivate pen → exploit anomaly → inscribe revision → anomaly responds → charged poise at peace. Orientation is strong from the outset, and setup pays off in the closing image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses certainty and accepts a new stance at cost. The price is more conceptual than material, keeping it short of a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern intensifies from solitary mapping to performative sound, culminating in a charged poise: she plays on after Kael’s departure, accepting erasure as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: clue → chamber → blank scroll → choice to become keeper. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines “rescue” as secrecy, with the cost of continued misrecognition. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the throughline holds. Minor ease in puzzle-solving slightly reduces pressure but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: ritual drumming → harmonic alignment → apparition → overload → extinguished vision. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights the premise with cost. Causality holds—her escalating insistence triggers the machine’s breach and loss. If anything, the final turn is more imposed failure than a dilemma, but the price is still felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal drive is clean: map → key → path → obstacles (collapsed walkway, overseer) → adapted tactics → delivery → response note. Closure lands on the page with a concrete success and conceptual price/validation under the “quiet methods” ethos. The cost is mainly risk and stealth, not a heavy sacrifice, but it remains legible. Orientation is crisp early and the single-scene arc stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene, single focus, with clear anchors and an accumulative/textural drive that tightens through the pattern-building to the held star and the gentle unweaving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the child’s stance toward darkness is reweighted on the page. Cost is quieter—renunciation of speech and the deliberate, time-consuming craft—but legible. No causality breaks or rule resets; the pattern teaches itself and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: present‑tense planning → execution → dawn image that reweights meaning. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (library/chess/propaganda), and the plan’s steps track cleanly to payoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with a visible social shift (public recognition) but the personal cost remains mostly implied. A single on‑page snag or pressure point would have deepened the decisive feel.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the song, light, and object intensify toward a decisive transformation. Orientation is crisp from the sublittoral fringe onward, and the transition underwater is taught and clean. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (foregoing her shore‑life) rendered on the page, not summarized. The causal thread is lyric but coherent: call → glow → choice → transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Situational/Accumulative lens, pressure coheres: quiet routine → neighbor visit/report threat → reaffirmed hush. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she keeps narrating, accepts the cost, and reconfigures the hush as a deliberate sanctuary. Orientation is clear from the start (farmhouse, turbines, Mandate). The cost is legible on the page in the report risk and the ethical trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats intensify through patterned resonance: approach → shadow‑script → boundary dissolution → paraphrasing glyphs → city’s breath reweighted. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the atrium shifts from sanctum to beacon, with laws reinterpreted on the page. Cost is mostly conceptual/social rather than personal peril, so the ending’s price feels soft though legible. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and causality holds without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal spine with an accumulative cadence: request → barter → wait → reveal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he sought color but receives a reweighted truth about light within imperfection. Cost is legible via the offered tool and silence-as-stance, though the return of the reed slightly softens price paid. Orientation and lens remain steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative drive holds: observation → capture → intensification → bell‑ring transformation. Closure arrives on the page as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (“not by finding a song, but by remembering how to feel its absence as a presence”). The lensed sequence pays setups (grid, lens, bell) without hand‑waving. Cost is legible in the reweighted aim and emotional expenditure at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the vellum stencil → origami/coordinates practice → doubt → alignment of the curtains → lantern projection → public acknowledgment → returned lotus with coordinate. Closure lands with a charged outward projection and a communal answer the next morning, reconfiguring her path from mourning to cultivation. The cost is subtle but legible—she risks vulnerability and reclaims a hollow refuge tied to her husband. Structure holds a single POV with one night–morning hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a held Accumulative/Textural lens culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: from individual fortune‑telling to communal diagnosis. The measuring tape and branching paths tighten the motif density, reweighting the stake (“How do you find solid ground?”) into “map our shared fault lines.” Cost is conceptual—accepting loss as cultural rupture—not visceral, which limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene spine, clean orientation, and a held Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through cadence disruption and sensory density. The closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: success via refusal of pattern, with visible cost (anguished joy, heavied veil). Causality is coherent—her tactic elicits the pagoda’s softening and stabilizes the atoms. The before/after is legible without mechanical overwrap.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure form: Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis. The methodical comparison yields a reweighting (the shadow as consequence), then a decisive action (injecting the stone’s solitary memory) that transforms the threat and alters the world’s terms. Cost is legible in the final acknowledgment that the naïve, effortless hope is gone; a quieter ember remains. Minor plausibility stretch on the stone’s “injectable” memory, but world logic sustains it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the revealed fraud and visible injury press a stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she commits to documenting, reporting, and a slower rehabilitation instead of an immediate release. Cost is legible in the renunciation of prior trust and the practical delay for proof. Orientation, scene unity, and causal throughline are clear and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with Accumulative dominance: the melting hourglass tightens the moment while image-density crescendos to a Conceptual Repricing—“the displaced miracle wasn’t the hourglass—it was his own scarred body.” Cost lands clearly with the loss of the fern’s voice. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the throughline is coherent. The final stance forecloses a path (no more reopening others’ scars) with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens: accumulative lyric texture with a causal spine—film threaded → psychometry → clue → coordinates → descent → transfer—culminates in a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the demolition clock coherently pressures tactics. Closure lands: she transfers and leaves, bearing a burden as the theater will fall; the cost is legible though primarily conceptual/emotional. A single concrete impediment during the descent could have further tightened causality and price.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each traced meteor key incrementally deepens pressure until the single star’s descent triggers the release. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the ritual’s mechanics build logically. Closure lands on the page with cost: the archway’s detonation of stardust and Elara’s collapse mark a decisive before/after. The final cadence shift (auroras softening, archway sighing) confirms resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coherently builds from sterile duty to a reweighted purpose as spores infiltrate the archive. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the archive reframed as vessel/potential and the final dream of roots. The cost—abandoning the predictive map and living with uncertainty—is legible. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene focus holds.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal snap at the pulley. Orientation is clear; the two‑shard move (sleep translocation → platform) supports a clean on‑page reconfiguration as the mechanism purifies oil into water. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, earned by the established hum/gear pattern. The on‑page cost is largely internal (renouncing control), present but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the token requirement → crossing → star hollow forms a coherent tightening toward a quiet on‑page repricing of courage. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when), and setups pay off (ticket, ferry, star motif). Closure lands with the palm‑press and glow, reweighting the vigil as the start of courage. Cost is subtle (leaving the tether and uncertainty), but legible within this lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the discovery of the bolt functions as the decisive intensification leading to an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the final offering of the bolt plus the stay/witness stance lands with cost. Causality is modest but coherent: perception → memory → reweighted choice. Minor exposition stretches flirt with telling, but they don’t break the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single, well‑oriented scene with causal beats: preparation → arrival → celestial lock → revelation → “Witness” → sunder → flight. Closure lands decisively on the page with a visible change in world status (decree dissolves, crown falls), and the celestial window creates urgency. Slight convenience in Elara’s timely arrival softens the rigor, but not the coherence. Cost is primarily conceptual/social rather than personal harm yet still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Causal lens, the assembling of evidence leads directly to the delayed realization that periodic storm surges, not sea‑level rise alone, erased the paths. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when), and the beats progress cleanly to a closure image. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: knowledge changes the frame, and the final steady taps accept the cost of irreversibility. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than event‑driven, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through atmosphere and the hum’s deepening presence rather than adversarial turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the rebellion’s “enemy” redefined on the page and the final image reweights the stakes. Causality is coherent and the scene stays anchored; the cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is solid from the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: search for clarity → kite discovery → plant‑mediated decoding → unsealing → hybrid emergence. Orientation is quick and stable, and the closure is an on‑page decisive act that reconfigures options. The cost is implied (defying elders, accelerating change) rather than strongly dramatized at the end, keeping it short of exceptional. Still, the structure holds with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene structure with a clean arc: gull cry triggers panic, she escalates into deeper freeze, then methodically grounds and resumes work. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; density builds, culminating in a charged, purposeful resumption. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost and no soft reset. Orientation is clear from the outset (arboretum on a cliff, automated lighthouse), and there are no causality lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: storm pressure + object handling → interior reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (lighthouse library, storm, artist with failed canvas). Closure lands via conceptual repricing and charged poise as she accepts fragmentation and chooses descent without a lantern. The cost is on the page (confronted memories, ongoing ache), and the lighthouse beam’s change pays off the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: spill ink → eclipse light → induced terror → pattern flare → fade → conceptual repricing. Closure lands cleanly with a charged final image (fist around the drone) and the cost of understanding. Orientation is crisp early; causality is intact without conveniences. Minor over‑explication near the end keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Situational‑tilted Hybrid lens: letter → upload → enforcer incursion → cryo‑feint → dawn aftermath. Closure lands on the page with cost (self‑chilling, real risk of capture) and a reweighted world (emergency assembly, crowd). The enforcers’ arrival is timely but not a cheat; coincidence complicates rather than resolves. Orientation is steady from the first lines; the single‑scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: external pressure (raiders) forces stance crystallization; closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise via the deliberate sheathing and protective act. Orientation is clean early; causal throughline from finding the engraved scrap to its tactical use lands. Cost is legible on the page; the antagonist withdrawal feels plausible but borderline convenient, keeping this just under the 9.0–9.4 band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via density, pattern break, and cadence shift. Causality is coherent: universe loosens → strike voices silence → dissonance → basin focus → capture echo; the closure lands on-page with the world reknitting. Stakes are tested in the collapse and the peril of “shards of shattered sound.” Cost is felt but modest; still, the earned cadence shift to lullaby provides satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive is clean: the call → observatory tools → logic test → decisive instruction to publish. Orientation is crisp early (observatory, chronometer, timestamp dispute) and the ending action lands closure. The cost is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening the punch. Nonetheless, the throughline is coherent and concludes with a Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine: firmware cry → letters’ reframing → ritual tether → hush. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: silence is achieved but cost persists. The letters verge on convenience yet function as a motivated reveal housed in the console, keeping causality intact. Cost is legible in channeling terror and in the acceptance of lingering grief.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: atmosphere densifies into the emergent hush, prompting Elara’s nonverbal intervention that reweights the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s stance shifts from despair to charged hope and the final image (tile vibration, lilac/gold light) consolidates the before/after. Cost is present but soft (painful unlearning, relinquishing the mandala to the grotto). Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: discovery of the tessera → retrocognitive vision → key placement → revealed inscription → confrontation → demolition paused → intent to rename. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise with social cost implied (defying the council’s narrative) and an immediate consequence (crews lower tools). Orientation is crisp from the outset; single POV and scene hold. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: worklight → scent → hidden orchard → coin → woven echo → intervention → charged token. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she cannot repair the catastrophe yet salvages one life, and the theater’s demolition persists. The coin’s pearl gives on‑page proof of change and price. Orientation is early and clean; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Hybrid with causal dominance—recall and static shock lead to a new protocol, executed on the page to reconfigure meaning. Orientation is immediate (studio, ruined mapper, recall notice) and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost (accepting failure and changing aims). Escalation is compact but logical: insight → set‑up → controlled trial → result. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, but it’s legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative discovery (spectral readings → floating fossil) and causal follow-through (she pockets it; levitation ceases; she reframes mission). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the object’s meaning shifts from personal comfort to communal signal with a conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single-scene coherence holds. The cost is felt (relinquishing ownership, burden of translation) though not devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive holds: tactile causality (jar tremble → “Begin” → coordinate insight → mapped route) integrates with a lyric build. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the prophecy as compass, not sentence) and a decisive plan (descend at noon with map). Cost is implied—social opposition and urgency—rather than dramatized in direct conflict, keeping it just short of top tier. Orientation is clean from the opening image and the pattern taught by recurring objects pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the sequence—prepare codes → warning → decision → transmission → ally’s acceptance—links cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: trust partially restored and self‑belief reweighted, with the satellite data as concrete outcome. The on‑page cost is primarily risk and emotional exposure rather than a paid wound, but it’s legible at the moment he refuses safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story tightens via rain/gutters ticking, frayed rope, drift toward mudflats, then a cadence shift as rain ceases and alignment is found. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: safe landing through distilled attention and mending, with the “palimpsest promise” realized. Cost is implicit (risk, vigilance, delay) rather than directly borne, yet legible in the constrained stillness and time pressure. Orientation is clear from the outset; the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise as “kindness is a kind of light” reweights the site and his task, with the final image of him carrying the warmed shard. Orientation is clean from the start; beats increase in density via the thrum and cross-time overlays. Cost is subtle—he embraces witness over repair, accepting limits while taking on stewardship—but it is legible. The causal thread is secondary, yet the accumulative cadence coheres and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the mirrored constellation builds toward the moon’s shift and the alley’s transformation, landing a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost in patience, exposure, and craft. Orientation is clear from the start (who/where/when). The final image reweights the scene—dark corners now reachable by light—without mechanical tying-off. Cost is quiet rather than acute, but legible in labor and the risk of tending hope in hostile space.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens toward the dawn strike and the hum’s modulation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift (who/where/when in the opening lines), and the sundial/hum apparatus links cleanly to outcome. Closure lands on‑page with cost as the memory nearly splinters before being tempered. The only small softness is how smoothly the mechanism succeeds, but it’s prefigured and does not undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and gestures build toward a resonant reconfiguration as Elara transforms her role in a clear before/after. Orientation is early and clean; the two‑shard structure (rainy evening → next day) is legible. Closure lands on the page with cost—she exposes a private need and forecloses her old mode. The nest’s spark → arch weaving → communal participation forms a coherent chain.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: protests → cover for tricksters → Aris’s infrasound plan → brief success → power surge cost → charged final stance. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who, where, when). Closure arrives as a Charged Poise: a clear signal gained at the price of likely administrative reprisal, with the rolled chart as concrete proof. The only soft spot is the speculative leap in method, but it’s seeded and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens, dominantly causal: the organ’s thrum halts the mutiny, revealing the alcove; she probes, retrieves, escapes. Closure lands with a decisive change (key obtained) plus charged aftermath cost (hollow victory, ongoing duty). Setups (fallow lull, organ’s subterranean carry, compass calibration) pay off. The organ intervention skirts coincidence but is foreshadowed and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative build culminating in a causal nudge: the declaration and portrait prompt the witness to surface. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“the cold case was warming”—with a felt (if modest) cost in Elena’s exposure and long endurance. Orientation is clean early and the single scene holds. The coincidence risk is mitigated by the act that triggers response.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: coded stanzas → focused question (“Why the nail?”) → reinterpretation → stance to stay and finish the map. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the nail and the grandfather’s “exile,” with Earned Stasis in her choice to remain. Cost is present (isolation, failing generator), though it’s more implied than dramatized post‑decision. Orientation is clear early, and the single‑scene frame holds.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats (tarp → descent → discovery) supported by lyric accrual; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing of “amnesty.” Orientation is clear early and the mapping device is taught before use. Cost is legible in risk and in the broken bow’s return as transformed proof. A minor convenience feel remains—the path yields without a true setback—but the cadence tightens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure resolves in a resonant reconfiguration: he forecloses flight and reframes territory via markers. Because/therefore links are subtle but hold: bankruptcy and inherited pattern pressure → choosing quiet territorial signals → walking toward town. Cost is legible (giving up the familiar escape script). Orientation is clear and the closure image (spiral, town lights) lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative lyric dreamwork + causal verification via Rho Lyrae) holds cleanly. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, the dream shard is taught and paid off by the spectrograph scene, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (relinquishing isolation). The telegram’s “Trust the rhythm” causally prefigures the decoding beat, which reweights the premise. Stakes are intimate and coherent, though the monsoon clock remains atmospheric rather than an active squeeze in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive is tight: failed ritual → search via gift → retrieve seed → unbend path → contact confession → shatter → lake stills. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the physical calm is bought by confronting guilt, not just spellcraft. Cost is legible in the sacrifice of the preserved confession and the acceptance of culpability. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene structure holds without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual sequence coheres: examining scars → blood bridge → heeding silence → planting → roots loosen. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: constraint persists but reweighted (a first step granted). Cost is on the page (blood, surrender to pain) and the final image is charged. The path to success feels slightly low‑friction, but the cadence shift is convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: past bargain frames the goal; the ritual tactic (carving/inlay) escalates; roots respond and bind; she accepts a new role with cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the final hum under constraint reframes the premise at a price. Orientation is quick and clean; single scene holds. The cost is legible on the page in the image of her bound body and foreclosed future.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean single-scene structure with clear anchors and a cohesive accumulative drive toward a resonant reconfiguration. Because/therefore is less central than pattern build; the closure (keeping the cloth, revaluing purpose) lands on the page. Cost is implied (professional compromise) rather than dramatized under pressure, tempering impact. Still, the before/after is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because he applies analogical reasoning and adjusts the arbor per the tablet, the seed flares and the field reconfigures; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he cannot cross into Elara’s experience). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final image makes the before/after legible. The one softness is the ease of the success once he tries, but the cost tempers that.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tidal rhythms and forge-work build to a resonance where “preserving wonder” is reweighted as letting go. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts transience and redefines preservation with a felt price (relinquishing anchoring futures). Orientation is strong from the opening. The arc is quiet but legible, with one decisive deepening at the furnace/ghosts beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery → recognition of confessions → crowning act → warming wave → refusal to decommission. Orientation is clear early, and the build is coherent with one decisive intensification at the crowning. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with an implied cost (defying mandate). Cost is present but lightly rendered on the page, keeping this short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mapping → graffiti encounter → instrument and tears → journal pivot → benedictional exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: relinquishing the chart-as-control strategy for a stance of surrender, on the page (“Today, I began to forgive myself”). Causality is soft but coherent, each beat arising plausibly from the last. Orientation is clean from the opening and supports the close.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the measured delays tighten from six to five seconds, building toward the zero‑second reveal. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the countdown pattern is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—an earned, pressurized pause before the reveal—yet the cost remains mostly implied rather than enacted. The causality is consistent, but the absence of a decisive on‑page change limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Situational lens holds: a live clock and converging forces compel a stance at closure. Causal steps are coherent (plant warning → coffee divination → propagation → nectar repair → confrontation → renunciation) and the cost is visible (losing the violin). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the object is surrendered while the propagated hope shifts meaning. No orientation debt; world logic supports the miraculous growth under solstice rules seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the accumulative drive coheres through pattern-finding to the precise infusion. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the world ends while a single spark endures, with the loss felt on the page. Causality is clean: practice → pattern → timing → infusion → preservation. The cost is explicit—Kael’s death and world’s obliteration—and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with a causal middle (dim vines → climb → spot scallops → harvest → ritual) resolving to an accumulative thematic cadence at the end. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—contentment reframed as tending—with on‑page action supporting the insight. Cost is mostly historical/relational rather than newly paid in the scene, softening impact. Orientation is crisp and scope‑appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, chime codes, the shard, and the cloak pattern toward a charged, on‑page decisive act: unhooking the clasp. Cost is legible—he relinquishes his shield/tool and stands exposed to the wind. Orientation is clear from the opening, and set‑ups (chime lexicon, shard’s hollowness) pay off at closure. The beat structure tightens cleanly to the final image without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripples, hush, and light build to a conceptual repricing when stillness reflects stars sharper. Closure lands on-page with cost—Elara’s accelerated regression and departure, leaving Kael to carry the truth. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the single-scene frame is coherent. The because/therefore is thematic rather than plot-mechanical, but the cadence shift at silence → mirror is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: bird pattern → arrowhead discovery → resonance comprehension → renunciatory closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he stops skimming, maps internally, replaces the arrowhead. Cost is legible conceptually (decades invested, relinquishing the tool), though not sharply dramatized. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: placement of the keystone deepens pressure, the luminance reweights meaning, and the descent fixes stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with a visible cost (risk on the spire, surrender of the object, abandonment of the pack). Orientation is clear early and the final image is paid by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from festival → descent → cipher → chromatic revelation → inward compass. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: sound’s color is real but interpretable only through darkness/light, and the compass points inward. Cost reads as a chosen restraint and acceptance of partial knowledge rather than spectacle; it’s present but subtle. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual → static analysis → rhythm discovery → harmonic alignment. Orientation is clean from the opening, and closure lands on the page with the colony lights syncing to the frequency (Resonant Reconfiguration with a small Decisive Change). Causality is coherent within the lyrical mode—coins to static to resonance—without teleporting rules. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual builds density—light, whispers, crystallization—toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and closure lands with a before/after reweighting of her grief and task. The cost is evident as an ongoing burden of naming rather than a sharp on-page price, but it’s legible in the charged final image. Single-scene integrity and one deepening (the crystals form) satisfy the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: measurement → breath‑matched magic → repaired bell → ripple/trickle result. Orientation is established early (who/where/when) and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: time bought, not victory, with the cost articulated in the limited effect and fatigue. The drive lens remains causal with a light accumulative texture from recurring drop intervals.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: receding water → shard/label → remembered instruction → hearthstone tin → revelation → decision. Orientation is firm early and held; single‑POV continuity stays tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with discernible emotional cost. The hearthstone clue verges on neat but is pre‑motivated by Silas’s words, preserving plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean early (hidden orchard behind kaleidoscopic waterfall; Elara at the crucible). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the murmuration’s pattern tips a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reweights her approach and secures a charged poise ending before dawn. Because/therefore links hold: hesitation → observation → recalibrated tactic → threshold readiness. Cost is internal but legible—the renunciation of force and the vulnerability of trusting wonder—enough for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: detect buckle anomaly → descend and repair → second anomaly → renewed scan and dawn closure. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres and culminates in a resonant stasis (“Systems nominal. Trust intact.”) with cost acknowledged. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and causal beats link smoothly. The absence of a true on‑page reversal keeps it below the highest band, but closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: Kael’s ultimatum → Aris decides to act → vivification → legal/personhood shift and inner thaw. Closure lands on the page with both external reconfiguration (custody conceded) and internal change. Cost is emotionally legible though not protracted. Orientation is strong from the opening and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single-POV, one-scene accumulative structure is clean, with anchors established early. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he commits to protecting the site and reframes his art via “The Silent Bloom.” Cost is implied (privacy, vigilance, forsaking public spectacle) but not strongly felt. Causality is coherent—the note → location choice → vow—and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from one blower to seven, then voice and leaves to mist, coheres toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as laughter returns upstairs, with cost in strain and the acceptance of grief’s persistence. Orientation is clean early; the two‑shard transition (tunnel to living room) is legible and motivated. No causality breaks; every step feeds the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative close: because/flicker → dig → vision → recoil → reframe → integrate → veil hum resolves in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Closure lands via a clear on‑page reconfiguration (strengthening without hardening) with conceptual and sensory cost. Orientation is strong early and continuity clean. The cost is more conceptual than practical, but the burn, trapped paw, and renunciation anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal beats: three attempts escalate toward the “penny drops” shift. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph, and the final image (crystalline bloom) delivers on-page closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) with the cost of failure endured and faith renounced. Each failed attempt narrows options toward the gentler vivification approach. No teleports or rule breaks; the crozier’s state tracks cleanly into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; the accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to the resonance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: silence redefined, city/gorge reweighted, frequency locked, and the “map” secured. Cost is present but light (safety override, structural strain), slightly softening the decisive feel. The throughline remains coherent with one tightening turn at perigee.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are clean: pattern recognition → horn triplets → lattice → hourglass capture → ferry reforms. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a conceptual price (he remains in the grotto, vigilance ongoing), though the cost is light. Orientation is firm from the outset and the throughline never breaks, but the solution comes without a meaningful setback.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density and pressure build from subtle recalibration to an “eruption” that spreads, then reconfigure via the co‑weaving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost: pain acknowledged, scars not wounds, and the craft’s purpose repriced. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and causality reads: her pattern causes the rupture; her revised tactic integrates it. The ending’s before/after is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is clear, with a present‑tense task (calibration) tightening into a charged final image. Orientation is clean, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Thalassa shifts from tomb to cradle as the system hums to life. Cost is implied (endurance in the dark, faith in an unseeable map) rather than dramatized, but it’s thematically earned. Causality holds through action (adjust nodes; starfield stabilizes).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: faint pulses → bench → photograph → pointed finger → structural flaw → evacuation; the blueprint knowledge and caretaker recognition reinforce plausibility. Closure is on‑page with a decisive change (evacuation before collapse) and a charged final handoff of the photo. The cost is mostly conceptual and reputational rather than materially felt, limiting peak impact. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Situational with causal linkage—time pressure from the tide coheres the scene and Arden’s actions tighten options. Closure lands with cost: she secures codex and capsule but the facility is reclaimed; the final image reconfigures her role and the stakes. Orientation is clean from the start; no teleporting props or unkept setups. The early return of the tide is a meaningful turn that forces a decisive, costly exit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when anchored within the first paragraph). A causal throughline holds: ink‑spiral → defragmentation → digital ghost → choice to accept corrupted segments → pulsar coordinates. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a repriced rule (imperfection as data). The cost is subtle (isolation and relinquishing “pristine” data) but legible in the quiet earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene escalates from entry to ritual, alignment, breakthrough, and rupture. Closure lands on the page: the diamond’s crack ends the attempt while leaving a charged imprint in Kael. Cost is legible (tool destroyed, language still dying), and the before/after is clear. Orientation is strong from the opening and remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative lyric texture riding a clear causal trigger (arrowhead + confession → metamorphosis); closure is an on‑page decisive change. Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene structure tightens purposefully. Cost is present but conceptual (surrendering human gravity/bitterness) rather than materially tested, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a Causal lens, beats link cleanly: play → signal received → hesitation → command → uprooting → realization. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (statue uprooted; orchard revives) and a Conceptual Repricing (statues are anchors), both on the page. Cost is legible in the upheaval and tearing free, even if danger to Elara remains largely implied. Orientation is immediate and stable through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: checkpoint scan → demand to open → EMP flick → launch drone → “Deviation noted.” Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single scene holds the lens to closure. The closure lands as a charged poise with a visible cost: his neutrality is compromised and surveillance tightens. No teleports or soft resets; the final “deviation noted” cements consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from ritual quiet to charged oasis to vocal risk, landing in a resonant reconfiguration: silence re‑priced as fertile ground through action. The live clock (wind bells) and the fragment’s hum motivate the turn to song; the oasis’s light holding after the bells fade marks a before/after. Cost is visible in the act of breaching his tomb of silence. Slight dampening: the clock’s constraint softens when the light persists beyond the chime.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds coherently toward a Charged Poise: the ritual intensifies, the library hums, and the ending reconfigures Elara’s role. Orientation is clean early; causality is simple but intact, with a clear ritual → reawakening → stance reweighting. The cost is subtle and largely conceptual (years of pursuit, solitude, risk kept quiet), which softens impact slightly. The closure lands on the page via sensory change and a final behavioral reset (return to desk as guardian).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: dawn observation → insight about light → systematic sunrise photography → decoded coordinates → decision to leave. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (who/where/when), and the solstice photo provides a satisfying on‑page turn. Closure lands via Decisive Change as she steps onto the causeway. The price is present but soft‑focused; the forbidden island and relinquishing her sanctuary carry the cost mostly by implication.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: waiting → star’s cue → cosmic understanding → offering longing → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with on‑page cost (spent longing; the ribbon’s ordinary remnant). Orientation is clean early and the pattern is taught through action. No causality breaks; the decisive cadence shift arrives with the Vega beat and the unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each step (“study shards” → “trace aberrations” → “find ring” → “touch” → “revelation”) follows and tightens. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual repricing plus a decisive shift (memories restored, forgiveness). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and props/rules pay off. The only soft spot is how safely the resolution arrives once the method works.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning causal: the dusk deadline, tea‑leaf geometry, and Kael’s crack insight chain into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on page when she redirects from the shadow to the fracture, stops walking backward, and annotates with cost (acknowledging past failure). Orientation is clean early, and the lens holds through the final charged image. The cost is conceptual/emotional but undeniable and tied to the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual intensifies from preparation to spectral harvesting to infusion and planting, culminating in an on‑page sprout that reweights the valley. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the cerulean returns, and the valley’s affect shifts. Cost is present but soft (the chest ache, years of sacrifice, “final ritual”). Orientation is clear early; the throughline never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of unraveling intensifies to a decisive deepening at the brother’s knot, then resolves into a charged quiet. Orientation is clean from the outset and causality holds: each knot releases a spirit due to her specific actions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she remains in the work, but the hush is transformed and the cost has been paid. The structure is single‑scene and coherent, with no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: footage comparison → inference about blocked fissure → gentle restoration of airflow → rain catalyzes the whisper. Orientation is swift and stable; single scene coherence holds. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost as fresco fragments wash into the earth, reconfiguring the site’s meaning. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a lyric overlay and stays consistent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear single‑scene structure with strong anchors and an accumulative/textural lens: objects accrete meaning until a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost—he refuses possession and “doesn’t look back.” The causal hinge (Eleanor’s preserved note inside a century‑old wreck) leans on coincidence/magical logic not taught by pattern, which softens rigor but doesn’t break the internal arc. The because/therefore chain is more thematic than plot‑mechanical, yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and clean causal links: plate stabilizes → symbols clarify → she encodes → ghost asks to sing → she sings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her song bridges human and code, reweighting her grief and the ghost’s loneliness. The cost is subtle but present in the vulnerability of breaking self‑imposed silence. Orientation is clear and single‑scene coherence is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: elevator ascent, shifting light, and revealed text progressively reweight meaning. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes the spire and her service. The “sunbeam through a flaw” provides the decisive intensification before the final repricing. Cost is subtle but legible (secret kept under authority’s eye), keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres from drift → anomaly → spiral revelation → oxygen warnings → charged final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: proof secured at personal risk, reweighting “emptiness” with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causal seams break the frame. The rescue-at-dawn coda risks dilution but functions as afterglow, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: coin → safe → materials → precision craft → slip → demolition. Orientation is crisp early and the final image delivers Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with cost (failed containment, building’s destruction). Each step tightens the window toward dawn without stray detours. The closure lands cleanly on-page and reweights the attempt over outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases (numbers, bird rhythms, hopscotch angles) culminating in a triangulation and logged bearing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—perception becomes the map—with a credible plan for tomorrow. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what pressure). The cost is modest but legible in isolation and risk of misreading; the throughline never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative with clear causal turns: prophecy → listening → uncap → click → orrery resumes. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the eclipse clock tightens structure. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration and a felt price (restraint, risk of failure at the peak moment). The world‑scale stakes are localized through the orrery, avoiding outline‑like escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal spine: dawn message → reinterpretation of “roots” → collective dig → aquifer gush. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when), and the closure is on‑page with a decisive change in circumstance. The cost is plausible (time, stamina, stakes of failure) and the pattern of prior messages earns today’s risky choice. Resolution is swift but credible within the length.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural drive, pattern density builds to a clear on-page closure: the hush recedes, the clock restarts, and a night bird’s chirp lands the after. Causality is legible (the nested-pattern lullaby nudges gears; the lighthouse beam refracts; time folds back) with a felt price. Orientation is clean from the outset and the throughline holds. The ending is a Decisive Change with Earned Stasis notes and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages hold (oath → blueprint method → path assembly → travelers’ escape), with a tidy Charged Poise at the end. Closure’s cost is modest but legible: time window closes as frost forms and Elara’s duty persists. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → patterned insight → reframed purpose with a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (chemist in ravine post-accident), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (grief endures as “companion”). Causality is soft-but-coherent: the ravine’s patterns drive the choice to return and create healing materials. The paper title risks over-explication but does not break the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds to a single decisive intensification (incising the void) that reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost: she abandons her core product and reframes beginnings. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the beats sequence coherently toward the beam-through-absence reveal. No causality gaps; the final image alters options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: dream/pools → deduction → discovery → overwhelming contact → tactic of cooking → communal serving → eased but not erased pain. Closure lands on the page as a decisive change in how remorse is held (shared release), with cost borne in her willingness to ingest sorrow. Orientation is firm from the first lines and never wavers. The lens reads primarily causal with lyric texture, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration as the clock and elevator harmonize and the community gathers at dawn. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (Prague clock, librarian, fractured rhythm). The sonic call‑and‑response lands on the page with a felt result, though the cost is modest (night labor/strain rather than a hard trade‑off). Still, the ending reweights the premise with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent: set up, activation, overwhelm, stabilization, reframe. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he exits transformed into a “keeper of lost light,” with the mirror charged anew. Cost is legible via bodily risk and psychic inundation, though the pathway faces little on‑page resistance or reversal. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when), and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: inversion window → threshold activation → inscription access → copying under a ticking clock → escape before seal. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration—she exits with the combinations and a new role. Cost is implied more than felt (responsibility and near-miss timing), limiting the punch. Single-scene integrity and anchors are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from stillness to swelling resonance and resolves in a Charged Poise: a final chord and the acknowledged price of further splintering. Orientation is crisp (grove, oak monolith, porcelain insulator), the sequence coherent, and the closure image carries cost. The porcelain’s warm pulse promises continuation, reweighting the world’s silence without neat fix. The ending lands on the page with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory and ritual density builds to a charged poise where he reconceives the eclipsed covenant and chooses a course. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (keeping the vow, accepting exile) rather than a decisive external turn. Orientation is crisp from the start; the beat sequence tightens coherently toward the shooting‑star/bishop diagonal reveal. The cost is felt but muted, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of attempts (C, E‑flat, A 432Hz) coheres and deepens pressure toward the opening. Orientation is clean early (workshop, fireworks pending, singular goal). Closure lands on‑page with the clasp blooming and a conceptual repricing of silence/empathy; cost is subtle but legible in her tears and the relinquished need for the lock. The causal thread stays intact without teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and patterned “turning of the tide’s thought” build to a reconfiguration where tactics change. Causality is clean: weeks of forcing → gale accident → discovered undercurrent → deliberate non‑intervention. Closure lands with cost (lost pot, surrendered control) and a reweighted rule‑set (serenity within motion). Orientation is crisp early; single POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation is clear early, the cove/arrow resonance tightens meaning, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing. The decisive act (pressing the tip to the arch) coheres causally with the earlier water‑guided approach. Cost is mostly conceptual/time‑bound (the inversion window), making the ending persuasive but soft. Structure is clean, single scene, with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: single scene, clear orientation, steady accrual of data leading to a charged vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—expanding the scope to include structural vulnerability and a promise to “make the invisible visible.” Cost is legible via physical hazard and the emotional weight of the patch. The drive lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative dominance that holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality is clean: chisel strike → aurora influx → bells → unfettering → sculpted hush. Closure lands on the page with cost (the amber sheet goes dull) and a resonant reconfiguration (the hush alters the world’s stance toward wonder). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the throughline holds. The tightening is modest but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through the canyon’s silence and the failed note to a Conceptual Repricing: listening over forcing. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the closure lands on page with cost (putting the flute away, abandoning the forcing tactic). One scene, one stake, one cadence shift—executed with control.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → inundation → contamination fear → repricing/renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when Aris refuses analytical mastery with a felt cost (abandoning the math and accepting burden). Orientation is clean and sustained within a single scene. Each beat causally intensifies toward the ending image without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from dread to charged attention to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands on the page as a shift in stance (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with costs named and felt (“a wave of sorrow”). Orientation is clean early, with one continuous scene and no causality gaps. The pendant’s action links beats coherently, avoiding soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density and patterning escalate (mist deepens, frost shifts, prism warms) toward a Conceptual Repricing—objects reflect rather than absorb emotions. Closure has on‑page cost (identity and prior work implicated), and the final act (placing the prism down, walking away) crystallizes the before/after. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: rummage-box discovery → puzzle pieces repair the loom → urgent recommencement → sacrifice. Closure lands decisively with on-page cost (loom dies; Elara’s essence departs). The convenient fit of jigsaw pieces risks coincidence resolving the central blockage, but the final outcome still relies on her agency and price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: discovery of the silk → decision to descend via mines → recognition of barter cost → surrender of voice → planetary knitting/healing on the page. Orientation is swift and steady; the drive lens is Causal and holds to closure. Closure lands with a decisive change (voice gone) and a resonant reconfiguration (Veridia’s pulse returning). The cost is explicit and shapes the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens, with causal steps (shard → weave → vision → reweighted understanding) delivered through accumulative texture. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what she wants), and the single transition to the live‑accident shard is legible. Closure lands as conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: the truth reweights the quest and forecloses the fantasy of rescue. The cost is on the page in the extinguished shard and the chosen burden.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the lamp’s failure, letters, sea glass, and stone language build toward a charged poise ending. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the two‑shard structure (lantern room → beach) is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot relight but redefines “keeping the watch,” with the harbor still blind, which is a real cost. The sea‑glass-as-first-link inference is a mild convenience but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: tending → storm pressure → off-axis blow → scattering → re‑seeing “broken” as amplification → decisive re‑steer. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing of failure into method, with the dawn as concrete outcome. Cost is legible in the near‑catastrophic scatter, white‑hot wick, and frayed focus under pressure. Structure is single scene, clean anchors, and one meaningful tightening at the rogue wave.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens: a causal beam (wing/prism → journal) catalyzes an accumulative conceptual reweighting. Orientation is crisp and the single scene holds. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt price (renunciation), though the floorboard journal illuminated by light flirts with convenience. Still, the because/therefore chain is legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly from pin-drop to moonlit repair to the sextant’s re-aimed purpose. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: what the trees “hold” replaces what they “see,” with the cost of not finding the wife’s vanishing acknowledged. Orientation is immediate and props track; the storm’s parting provides the needed cadence shift. The closure is on-page and earned without tying every thread.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from fragments to a climactic cadence shift: single notes → threads → communal reprise → sunrise. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse/orchard/mirror world), and the closure is on‑page (realm rekindled) with a felt, if modest, cost. Because/therefore linkages (tears on sun‑seed; song threads visible via window) track cleanly without late rule changes. The triumph is swift and nearly unopposed, limiting perceived cost at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear anchors (who/where/when) and a single-scene arc paced by the clock create clean structure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, density and cadence build to a charged midnight choice. Closure lands as a charged poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses isolation with visible cost. The book’s tailored message trims some friction but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the locket discovery reweights grief, and the tea house coda consolidates a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when clear by the tea house in the overgrown palace). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the decision to keep tending, with the cost of living with fragility. Stakes and turns are coherent without mechanical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene structure is clean, orientation is immediate, and the accumulative pressure coheres: illusions fade, instrument calibrations intensify, and the vow’s capture culminates in sealing the data. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: from tomb to a “quiet pulse of hope,” with the cryo‑vial as priced seed. Cost is legible in the vanishing world and the risk of mismeasurement tied to a predecessor’s failure. A hair soft on a decisive external turn, but cadence and stakes tighten effectively under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated false starts and deepening hush coherently build to a decisive break when the ledger is raised and a bottle shatters. Orientation and stakes are clear early; the clock to sunrise tightens options credibly. Closure lands on the page with cost: the truce breaks, violence erupts, and she leaves with the recording and a moral residue. The chain relies on market dynamics (elders, payment) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative design coheres: the carriers’ approach tightens the pattern until the nexus stabilizes and reweights meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the carriers as elected stewards and the ring as an emergent compass mapping convergence. Causality is clean and all setups pay off without teleports. The cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized, softening impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens from descent → broken lock → revelations → first line, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the silence becomes a crucible. Closure lands on‑page with cost: tears, trembling, and a reweighted relationship to the calling. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent without forced turns. The final image (crystals dimming to a gentle pulse) pays the build.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Causal—discover map → dishonesty pressure → method clue (“candor…”) → honesty assembles map → banyan unlock → Archive accessed. Closure is on‑page and paid: her costly truth‑admissions narrow options and become the method. No teleporting props; the zinc fragment set‑up pays off at the console. The cost is more vulnerable than perilous, but it’s legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: wind + ice + bells layer toward a charged poise at snowfall. Orientation is immediate (bluff, vocation, seasonal language shift), and the arrival → installation → performance → muteness forms a clean build. Closure lands with cost when her throat tightens and she leaves the Heart Chime to “speak.” The causal thread is gentle but intact, with the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation and stakes are crisply established; the causal chain is tight: dome failure → weight/pod constraint → box as conduit → miniaturization → controlled updraft exit. Closure lands on the page with cost: the dome implodes, he abandons the original habitat, and the farm survives only as a seed. The causal lens holds cleanly through the ending image. A hairline convenience in the tech logic doesn’t undercut the on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens with clear causal spine: locket → key → mailbox → letters; accumulation via neighbors’ memories. Orientation is crisp early (store, courtyard, dawn), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (community reknit by hearing Rajan’s letters). Cost is felt but gentle (exhuming grief). No major broken linkages or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: dice → journal line → embodied cipher → command → upload. Closure lands on the page with cost (time pressure from rising water; she foregoes flight until the data is away). Single-scene structure is coherent and tight. The cost is felt but not steep, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: investigation sequences (grounds → dig → chest → ritual) are causally neat while the closure is a conceptual repricing. Orientation is quick and clean (who/where/when by the first lines). Closure lands on the page: “He left…with empty hands” as memories remain transformed in the salt, a real cost. Beats link because/therefore without contrivance, and the final image reweights earlier signs.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors (Elara at the brook at night) and a coherent accumulative/textural drive: density of hush vs. coded hum builds to a cadence shift where the prophecy is contained. Closure is on‑page: the wing is spent, the air loosens, and she remains to guard—an Earned Stasis with tangible price. Because/therefore links are steady, with no teleports or resets. Cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual, object, and sky‑event build toward a Conceptual Repricing at the letter and Mrs. Thorne’s line (“The lie was the language. The truth was the looking.”). Orientation is clean from the outset (rooftop garden, two characters, night). Closure lands with conceptual cost: she renounces the interrogative demand for literal language in favor of a shared fiction. The final image (seal to chest as meteors fall) seals the after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative build toward a clean on‑page closure: the archiving completes, the seashell’s whisper ceases, and she leaves it buried. Orientation and stakes are anchored early, and the before/after is legible with felt cost (reliving the accident). The ritual’s steps flow causally even in a lyric mode, with a clear clock (before dawn). Slight smoothness—success feels assured once the pattern holds—keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds pressure through ritual, image, and cadence toward a quiet act that reweights the world. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the seal’s flaw is severed, the chrysanthemum smoothed, and the burden transformed, not erased. Orientation is clean from the outset; one continuous scene, one dominant stake. Cost is conceptual rather than tested, but legible (risk of exposure; acceptance of enduring burden).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent progression: meeting → revelation (gene) → tactic (progressive disclosure) → commitment despite warning. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses safety by deciding to sing only a fragment, with cost made legible by surveillance danger. The causal thread holds; new knowledge (gene/twin shell with Elara) tightens options. Stakes remain focused on survival of truth and her brother’s fate.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the dream fragments accrete toward a reconfiguration of cause (pride‑driven lie vs storm) and purpose. Orientation is clean from the start; the shrine and globe anchor time/place/POV. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: placing the globe reframes “wreckage” into a “promise,” with a felt emotional cost. Causal links between dream cameos and the revealed lie are coherent and pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative design tightens from observation to sonic test to ritual, culminating in a conceptual repricing: the fortress as loom, the world as hidden labor. Orientation is clear from the outset and the lens holds. Closure lands on the page—his tea ritual as acknowledgment—though the cost is primarily conceptual, not grievous. Setups (moon paths, grooves, whisk) all pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: anomaly → stillpoint → diamond → cylinder → letters → Verdant Protocol revelation → departure. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she restores the stabilizer and carries the evidence into danger. Cost is implied more than dramatized but present via the storm and the weight of truth. Structure stays within one scene and pays off its set-ups without teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. The radio fragments trigger reinterpretation, which directly motivates the tactical shift to energize the Portico, culminating in the refracted beam and faltered rise. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure lands on the page with a visible external consequence and a conceptual cost. The price is present but not deeply taxed in the final beat, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the find → memory → offering → bottling cadence reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he jars the child’s hum, recasting his practice as bridge not hoard. Cost is quiet but legible—he remains in isolation, choosing a stance over rescue. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: failing harmonics → ascent to lantern → key insertion/tuning → hum and minute adjustments under a sunset clock → harmonic resolution. Closure is a decisive change with cost (physical strain, near‑deadline, tower shuddering). The drive lens reads Causal throughout and holds to the end. Slight ease of success (no major setback) keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via moon/viaduct/rain alignment and the crowd’s restlessness until the chains yield. Orientation is clean and the closure is on‑page: links fall with a reweighted social stance. Cost appears as a chosen forbearance and risk of defusing a volatile crowd; it’s soft but legible. The cadence shift at the sighing iron achieves Earned Stasis/CR without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: observation of marks → re‑tracing sound → scalpel → footprint → decision to report, with the lantern/memories charging choices. Closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost (“consequences be damned”). Orientation is clean and single‑scene focused. The footprint‑to‑supervisor inference reads a touch neat, shaving rigor without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: each step flows—box delivered → fracture discovered → risky repair → music → letter’s hidden line—toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost: he reinterprets his role, assumes a duty (overnight drive), and releases part of his guilt. Orientation is clean within the opening; no scene breaks. The “light flooding” is a slight coincidence but it complicates rather than cheaply resolves, and does not undercut the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Strong causal spine: decoding pulses → punch cards → launch → approach → shortfall realization → embodied yearning → bell shatters. Closure is on the page with cost: the bell breaks, the arrow tip burns out, and the legend is relinquished/repriced. The drive reads Hybrid with a causal progression culminating in a conceptual repricing that reweights the legend. No orientation debt; constraints (acid sea, atmospheric window) press timely action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: anomalies → VOID → Leo clip → reassembly script → Vance confrontation → exposure. Orientation lands early (who/where/when), and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing charged by the reveal and the archive noticing (“numbers stopped recurring”). Cost is present but not crushing; career and existential danger are implied more than dramatized. The lens holds Causal through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: loss of visions fractures trust → Silas uses mirror glimpses to reconstitute the crystal → public projection resolves the accusation and reconfigures terms. Orientation is strong from the first lines and the two‑shard structure (store → confrontation) is clean. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (the clans’ pact and Kael’s visible shame). Cost is present but externalized to Kael more than Silas, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held through to closure. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when the final distant calving sound reweights her goal and method; the cost is endurance/presence in wreckage rather than escape. Orientation is clear early (Arctic marina, relief work), and the parasol → fissure → talisman chain tightens coherently. The on‑page near‑miss anchors consequence, preventing the lyric mode from floating.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bus’s departure and the found letter trigger a deepening that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands in the decision to keep the letter and the reframed meaning of “mismatch as crucible,” with a felt cost in chosen solitude and endurance. Orientation is clean from the opening lines. The pressure is quiet but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure builds from flickering clearing + parapet menace to aligned resonance and stabilization. Orientation is clean early (pavilion, desert, prophet’s arrival), and the closure lands on the page: the clearing solidifies and the echo is preserved. Cost is present (personal expenditure, fragility acknowledged) though not harrowing. One coherent scene with a measured, effective cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the emptying map case and group photo reweight the premise with visible emotional cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the pattern of photo‑arcs coheres. The key price (relinquishing her own grief image) is paid on the page as a revealed prior act that charges the ending. Escalation remains gentle but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, continuous scene with clear anchors and an accumulative/textural drive: sound patterns intensify, dawn intrudes, and the hush breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes proof as lived, sonic testimony and accepts a new evidence mode. Cost is subtle (she relinquishes linear scholarship for an uncertain, fragile method) but legible in the final catch. Setups (crystal’s property, hush, last dictionary) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound motifs and fog pressure densify to a cadence shift when the “plink” appears and then drains of meaning. Orientation is clear early (junkyard prophet in fog sculpture garden, chalk and driftwood tools). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he nearly bottles the echo, then loses it on the page, with cost. Setups (chalk, markers, premonition) pay off coherently at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: pressure builds via worsening tremors, culminating in a conceptual reframing that alters tactics on the page. Orientation is clean early (place, role, problem), and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page action (restructured feedback) and a reweighted clock image. The cost—abandoning resistance for attunement—reads and binds the arc. No causality breaks; the sequence tightens once and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the layered soundscape tightens toward the needle’s drop and the charged final breath. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), single scene coherence is strong, and the closure lands with tangible cost. The broken record’s use fulfills a taught pattern without causal cheats. The earned stasis at death is cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: examine scars → correct runes → insert key for precise tension → loops close → orrery reveals noon‑shadow truth → shard message reframes Varn’s fate. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt price (“She hadn’t found Varn”). Orientation is prompt and stable. The drive lens (causal) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly: object (tooth), setting (garden/sundial), and metaphor (bone setting) accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with cost—she foregoes certainty for a scarred, guiding praxis—embodied in the final plan to install the tooth as beacon. Orientation is crisp, and the single scene holds. The price is more conceptual than visceral but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual and memory builds toward the village illumination, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean, with one transition from grotto to square that maintains continuity. Closure lands with a charged final image (flameless lanterns igniting; communal relief) and a conceptual price (staying earthbound), though the pressure is gentle. Slight softness in on‑page cost keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation of the icicle pattern intensifies the meaning until the proffering choice reconfigures the stake. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost—the risk of vulnerability—paid on the page. Orientation is impeccable from the first paragraph; single scene, single POV, clean escalation into the final exchange. The final image (returned pendant, “held up to the light”) makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: cameos intensify, the failed capture (soldier dissolving) triggers a conceptual pivot, and the final release seals the arc. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the nexus rule‑set is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. No causal seams or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: alignment enables device → song produces threads → missing verse threatens failure → relic and remembered line root the stories into soil. Orientation is immediate (arbor at dawn; Elara; device) and the single scene tightens coherently. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change: the arbor shifts from withered to humming altar. The cost is lighter (no lasting loss), but the near‑failure and reliance on a fragile, inherited fragment make the change earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual intensifies toward totality and culminates in a charged, on‑page ignition and sealing. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) within the first lines; each step (pattern → map → transfer → seal) follows. Cost is primarily emotional and ritualistic rather than sacrificial, but it’s felt and shapes tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vial’s “tiny, safekept sun” reframes loss into preserved light.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: observation of light → misalignment insight → re‑calibration → captured echo. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she secures a fragment of Silas while accepting his absence and the season’s narrowing window. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the seasonal deadline charges the final act. The cost is subtle but legible in the refusal to pursue resurrection in favor of keeping a fragile echo.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual repetitions escalate from revealing small burden to the rope-shaped betrayal and the snow sealing the entrance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: trapped again, she accepts and recommits with visible cost (“weight sinking into her bones,” entrance sealed). Orientation is clear early and consistent. The causal web is coherent, though not razor-tight, befitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rain, kettle, and carving accrete toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is crisp early; one scene with a single transition to the kettle and back. The whistle creates a concrete beat that reframes the work and seals the before/after. The explicit thematic articulation at the end slightly reduces the need for the reader to make the final leap, but cost (tears, interruption, resumed intent) remains on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the count toward 100 and the ritual’s rules escalate pressure to the center‑lagoon negotiation. Closure lands cleanly with cost when the ghost dissolves and Elara exits with “hollow certainty,” reweighting “It only stops if you look away.” Orientation is solid early (who/where/what happened). The cause chain is coherent: fragments → ritual → encounter → refusal/silence; no contrivances.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is immediate (abandoned spaceport post-carnival), and the causal chain is clean: sextant insight → reroute → power boot → simulation → decision to return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—hope reframed as redirected flow—anchored by the terminal’s hum and the sextant’s reprise. The cost is modest (danger, labor, emotional sobriety) but present. Single scene coherence holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear single scene with a clean orientation and a held Accumulative/Textural drive: density of hush → bear arrival → reweighted meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (releasing the “Eternal Chronometer” ideal), enacted through present choices. Causality is coherent; no unkept setups. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the bear’s entrance tightens the frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial reweights the entire legend and redirects her mission. Orientation is clear early (towpath at dawn, radio silence) and causality holds (training → salvage → inscription → realization → purpose). Closure lands in her decision to pursue the radio archives, with a felt conceptual price of relinquished myth. The cost is real but quiet, keeping it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story tightens from observation to decipherment to transcription to vow. Orientation is clear early (dock, predawn, fog), and closure lands as a charged poise: method bound to memory and a plan to plant tomorrow. The price is implied—knowledge at risk, time and cold spent—but present enough. Causality is modest but coherent; no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation lands early (who/where/when), and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing: healing reframed from retrieval to witnessing absence, sealed by the revised obituary and the charged final image. Cost is legible as she accepts the burden of channeling grief and gives up the fantasy of restoration. The throughline from thread‑focus to reweighted premise holds cleanly without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean: discovery → construction → activation → hatch → acceptance, with each beat narrowing options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses the perfectionist path and chooses to hold, cost made legible by the “broken” beauty. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words and the lens holds through the end. The only soft spot is the near‑certainty of success—risk is felt but not materially complicating tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds toward the moment she “hears” the scar sing, which reweights the premise. Orientation is clear from the start, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—freedom crystallizes as she hears the hum and accepts a new stance. Cost is felt as years of shame and vigilant labor; the coin vow and grafting ritual make the price legible. The scene remains one continuous window with a single dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (causal trail + accumulative ritual) holds: breadcrumbs—>aqueduct—>Fountain of Echoes—>slow pour—>release. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (memories and water returning) and cost (spent key, long patience). Orientation is clear early (Aethel, Archivists, drought), and set‑ups pay off (geese pause, urn, box). Slight ease—no significant setback—keeps it below top tier, but the cadence shift at the urn is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sonar density mapping, approaching desolation, harmonic stabilization, then the returning ping that reweights the mission. Orientation is solid early (who/where/mission/tools), and the ending lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—mission completed with cost felt in the burden of being last steward. The closure image (touching the warm gear, vow kept) is on‑page. Slightly soft cost (no on‑page loss) keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions densify meaning until a cadence shift (the monarchs form a bowl). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: grief redefined as greenhouse‑vessel, with cost marked on the page. Orientation is crisp early; each move (look up → ribbons → reconfiguration) coheres. The spectral nudge is causal without shortcutting the earned final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds: ridge → makes/finishes bob at a charged pause → installs → town reanimates. Closure lands on‑page as a Decisive Change with a resonant internal reconfiguration (“not as penance, but as promise”), with felt cost rooted in Silas’s death. The rake handle’s wash‑up is slightly convenient, but it’s seeded and functionally exploited. Single transition is clean, orientation is early and firm.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the clock summons, the silo frames, deciphering intensifies toward the glyph constellation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Silas’s intention decoded, Elara accepts the charge. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but present; orientation is clean and the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Situational lens holds: coherent pressure culminates in a charged poise—he chooses to write despite explicit costs. Orientation is crisp from the first line; single scene, single stake. The closure’s cost is legible in the final beats (fractions of error with catastrophic consequences). Minor reliance on exposition (“the model showed…”) doesn’t undercut the on‑page decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens as the broadcast strengthens, culminating in dust speaking: a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when, “after the story famine,” ember alcove, shortwave radio). The closure lands on the page via the dust’s blue pulse and audible stories; the price (risk, secrecy, years of effort) is felt but largely implied at the end. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with one deepening beat (final lyric “dust, be my tongue”).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the chair’s stop cues the final ritual; density increases via ash, vanishing lines, flood memory, and resolves in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Closure lands on the page with cost: she ends the vigil and exits, reweighting “safety” as mirage and accepting transient truth. Orientation is clean early, and the end image repays taught patterns. No causality gaps or soft resets undermine the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene situational lens holds: work → intrusion → confrontation → stance crystallization. The closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise as Phil refuses to yield and re‑enshrines the cog, with cost implied. Orientation is clean, with because/therefore linkages (his maps and layers allow an evidence‑based defense). The turn is minor (Kael’s flicker of doubt) but sufficient at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story builds from library stillness to a silence‑led rehearsal method and culminates in a reweighted final image in the same charged space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the choir’s listening practice changes what performance means, with the felt cost of “weeks” of arduous unlearning. Orientation is clean early, and linkages hold (rosette → subtracting noise → method → concert in the library). Some middle transformation is summarized rather than dramatized, but the cadence shift at the end is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pruning, tasting, clearing space, planting, and vigil accrete toward the charged dawn image. Closure lands with the shoot’s emergence and her tasted memory of resilience (RR/Charged Poise) with a felt cost (fatigue, time, risk). Orientation is clean early; world rules (alignment-enabled growth) are taught and then paid off. The arc is quiet but coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Blackout → hive failure → riddle reframed as diagnostic → forced reveal → man runs to fix; the chain is clean, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost via her compulsion and exposure. Orientation is immediate and stable. The final image reweights options without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of sanctifications (inert yellow cottage → warmly alive bungalow → “dying” Finnegan place) coheres and tightens toward a conceptual repricing: houses are held, not haunted. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on the page with the Finnegan house’s faint pulse and Elara’s realization. Cost registers as emotional and conceptual, not material, yet it is felt in the risk of failure and the fragile, partial recovery. The pattern holds without contradictions or late rule cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is clean: discovery → revelations → reinterpretation → filament threading → repair. Closure lands on the page through a Decisive Change (mending the pillar) paired with Conceptual Repricing (embracing fracture/nuance), with a legible emotional cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset; single scene coherence holds. The resolution is a touch easy, but the narrowing of options through the pillar’s fault line keeps it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene causal spine is clean: theorem → convergence → strike → rupture → choice to refuse exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing under an accumulative lens: he redefines freedom as chosen confinement with cost (turning from the void). Orientation is clear early (who/where/what). Backstory about the sunlit door tightens present stakes rather than drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: ritual → painting → public posting → observed test → recognition → renewed commitment. Closure lands when the commuter’s memory sparks, repricing Elias’s doubt with a felt (if quiet) cost paid in vulnerability and sleepless endurance. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; two‑shard structure (greenhouse to bus stop) is clean. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive turn, but it’s earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens reads Causal: thaw and the end of the bees—> rising moisture—> elders’ last loaves—> decision to move the archives now using bread baskets. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with tangible constraints shaping tactics. The cost is felt (sacrificing the sanctity of ritual objects and the possibility this is the last rising) even as the future remains precarious. The ending’s charged image holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift and clean (lighthouse, low tide, hunger stone, yoyo), with a single continuous scene. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: time is “tuned” to possibility, the hands move “sideways,” and options reweight with the tide returning. The Hybrid lens with Accumulative dominance holds; cost is present but subtle (embracing uncertainty, finite tide window). A strong, coherent arc, though the price is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: resuscitation → return compelled by cursed photo → dictionary method → unbosoming → photographing self → fear dissolves. Orientation is immediate and stable; props and rules introduced early pay off at closure. Closure is on-page via a decisive act (self‑photograph) and a conceptual repricing (fear dies when seen) with a visible cost (surrendering luminance and risking self‑exposure). A slightly declarative final moral note tempers the punch but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene escalation from first rogue wave to “massive wave” and the orchard-saving arpeggio lands a on-page turn with closure. The Hybrid drive (causal beats under an accumulative lyric surface) holds through to the calm and moon-lit mallet. Cost is present though modest (exertion, damage, risk), and options narrow believably at the breach and wave crest. Orientation is established early and remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: whistle → resonance → crack → hidden map → revaluation of watchers → decision to follow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned resolve with a conceptual cost (walking into danger, reconfiguring the city from mute relic to guiding agent). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; the lens holds. The price is felt even if not yet paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, one continuous scene with a clean causal throughline from timed omen to decision; orientation is crisp from the opening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: a commitment to act tonight, reweighted by Clara’s silence and the “pit of lies” image. Reflection is heavy but tied to present cues (ivy, letter, rosebush) and culminates in a new stance. Cost is legible (anticipated dismissal, responsibility), though external opposition remains offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: survey → missing cornerstone → pry and strain → discovery → transcription → embedding → resealing. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene window holds. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the site becomes a tended testament as she sutures memory into stone, with the cost of relinquishing the artifact and physical exertion. The drive lens reads as causal with a quiet cadence lift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/casual investigative chain: candlelit constraint → noticing bleed inconsistencies → hypothesis → tactile tests → reindexing protocol. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she forgoes the sanctioned chronology, institutes a new marking system, and stamps a verified charter—before/after is legible. The cost is social/conceptual rather than on‑page punitive, but it’s present in her choice to separate forgeries and rewrite the framework. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean accumulative drive: climb → polish → sensation flood → gem reveal → lantern assembly → garden placement, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Causality is tight—polishing triggers pain and clarity; setting the gem reconfigures the dream. The cost (enduring the dream’s tearing and tears) is on‑page at the ending beat. Orientation is clear early; scope is well‑contained.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal progression: cooling downtime → auxiliary harmonics/perturbation → array tone → lattice reveal → geode manifestation → reframed mission with cost. Closure reads as a charged poise/conceptual repricing, with the decision to hunt/map and the cost of irreversibility on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening. No soft resets; the geode’s presence pays off prior set‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: atmospheric density escalates to a causal insertion that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and setup pays off with a timed, stakes‑charged act. Closure lands on the page (astrolabe activating; hum into lullaby) with a conceptual price—she renames herself beyond “drone pilot.” Cost is more interior than external, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: sifting → discovery of the watch hand → recovered context → self‑indictment → vow. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is crisp from the first lines. The coincidence of finding that exact shard presses plausibility but serves the causal turn without undercutting it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Situational lens, the exchange window, neutral ground, and moon-timed pressure force a stance crystallization at the “now” beat. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses release with acknowledged, unpaid costs (no apology or forgiveness yet). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the envoy’s arrival tightens to a single decisive act. Cost is legible in the final grip of the drawer pull, reweighted from loss to tool.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene, tightly framed moment: kayak launch to muddy bank. The closure lands on the page with cost via the renunciation of the compass and the charged act of turning and reaching for the phone. The inferred lens is Situational with causal linkage; pressure coheres from clouds/failed stars → utility poles → current vs intent → shore. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: map → fork → sacrifice → discovery of the girl → gifting the relic → path rekindled and exit chosen with her in arms. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (time risk, danger, and surrender of the relic) and a reweighted end image. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. The twelve‑hour clock is not reactivated late, but cost is still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fortune → spice‑gathering → ritual → remembered phoenix. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis; she forecloses resurrection and accepts a transformed bond with grief intact. The fortune cookie is a convenient prompt but tonally justified and integrated. Cost is legible in the final weeping and the reframed “homecoming.”

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural held cleanly; pattern density deepens toward a ritual climax. Closure lands on the page with cost: the saucer mends, the cloth glows, and her stance reconfigures (“presence” over “erasing absence”). Orientation is clear early, and cause-to-effect within the lyric frame stays coherent. Minor neatness in the wrap limits it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: ritual → emotional integration → happiness‑lightness → amplified stitch → gate opening, with shadows resisting to raise pressure. Orientation and rules are taught early and paid off without contradiction. Closure is a decisive on‑page change (souls freed) with cost (emptier ship, nearing death). No significant convenience or unkept setup undercuts the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when; single continuous scene), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: harmony among volcano, fireflies, and sky recasts his loss as gain. The cost is present (risk, broken bottle, forfeited wealth), though coincidences smooth causality and reduce edge. The final cadence holds the chosen lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → descent → sundial mechanics → coordinates → commitment to the cradle. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she acquires decisive knowledge and commits to action with the cost implied in the risk of misalignment and treason. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. Slight softness: cost is mostly conceptual, not palpably felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative textural build and causal turns: stone placement → slip → surrender → crimson stone → repriced understanding. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis with visible cost: he loses control and only glimpses truth briefly, transforming the meaning of the promise. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and all set-ups pay off (friction, dust, sequences, promise). No stray threads undercut the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm cancels the conjunction, forcing a pivot to measuring silences, culminating in a reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he ends the vigil, reframes scars as waypoints, and commits to descend tomorrow. Cost is legible—foreclosing the longed‑for external proof and accepting a broken world with only an internal map. Orientation is clear early, and all setups (timer, envelope) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate and the causal chain holds: discovery of the card → duel pressure → positional alignment → decoded overture → de‑escalation. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a Charged Poise image (brook’s song), though the capitulation happens quickly. The constraint of time/light is integrated, but decoding mid‑fence strains plausibility slightly. Cost is present but not deeply felt beyond risk and exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present-tense goal (plant the next phase) coheres with a charged final image. Orientation is immediate (moon, rusted library, Elias) and the prison shard reweights the present. Closure lands as Charged Poise: committing to gatherers before his courage fades, under pursuit. Cost is implied (authorities, persona cycle) rather than enacted, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal–accumulative hybrid lens, beats progress cleanly: refuge chosen → clock unfixable → sonic workaround → reel reveals paths → encore summons a figure and a single tick. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the ending lands as a charged poise image with a felt cost (time deadline, risk of exposure). Cost is more implied than explicit, slightly softening the decisive change but not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: dream data → Lyra’s song → seed awakens → memory flood → ridge stabilizes as rain begins. Orientation is clean, the monsoon clock compresses decisions, and the closure is on‑page with a discernible before/after. Cost is more conceptual than material (accepting doubt as ongoing), but it lands within the story’s terms. The single tightening turn is sufficient and coherent under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images (compass, lace, sea) densify toward a conceptual repricing of apology. Closure lands on the page with cost: he reframes apology as ongoing labor and enacts it, foreclosing pride and quick absolution. Orientation is clean early, and the final beat reweights prior motifs without a mechanical tie-up. The lace-triggered opening of a gap → light → revelation → action offers a coherent because/therefore chain within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a strong setup, inciting incident, and a Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The primary weakness is the resolution's causality; the villagers' immediate, unanimous acceptance of Elara's supernatural evidence ("Skeptical faces softened...

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, Causal drive. The plot mechanics are tight: a clear problem (snarled beacon) is solved by a specific tool (vial) through a costly character choice. The closure, a Decisive Change (rescue) paired with a Resonant Reconfiguration (internal peace), is effective and lands on the page. The only minor friction in the causal chain is the speed and certainty of Aris's understanding of the temple's resonance, which relies on a mystical insight rather than deduction, but it serves the plot's momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's central structural weakness is a severe causality break. The shift from a grounded prison escape narrative to a magical realist one—where the boy suddenly hovers on a beam of light—is entirely un-scaffolded. This "ancient magic" appears as a deus ex machina, resolving the plot's central problem without being earned by prior world rules or character action, significantly undermining the narrative's integrity despite a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural drive. It establishes a pattern of decline and intervention, then breaks that pattern with a final, costly escalation. The closure—a Decisive Change (orchard saved, bride gone) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Silas's new emotional state)—is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost in the form of the inert stone bead. All causal links, both magical and emotional, hold perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the plot progresses through a series of discoveries and textural linkages rather than strict causality. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the village from a state of grief to one of hope, with the cost legible in Elara's bled fingers and the path's fragility. The final image powerfully reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is superb. The narrative builds pressure through observation and accumulated knowledge, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration for a closure. The final image of the restored sundial provides a decisive change in Elara's state with a felt cost, made visible by Kael's tears. The causality is one of insight, not external force, and it holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story's central turn hinges on a significant coincidence: the children's chalk codes not only mirror the client's specific marginalia but are also precise coordinates. The late attempt to rationalize this as the children "guiding him" feels like a retroactive patch for a contrived plot device. While the closure itself (a Conceptual Repricing) is emotionally clear, the causal path to it is weak and undermines the protagonist's agency in the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens, with each beat logically and compellingly leading to the next. The structure is incredibly tight for its length, establishing stakes, introducing a complication (guards), and resolving the immediate plot point with a Decisive Change that lands with the felt cost of the coming violence. The closure, a Charged Poise embodied in the final stitched image, is both satisfying and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.6)
    The structure is flawless for its length, following a clear causal chain of action, revelation, and escalation. The drive lens (Hybrid Causal/Accumulative) is held perfectly. Closure is achieved via a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the external healing of the wound by moonlight provides a tangible, on-page correlative for the internal absolution, landing with a deeply felt sense of cost and release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The narrative isn't driven by external plot but by the intensification of an internal state, which is then externalized by Mei's arrival. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on the page as Aris reinterprets both Mei's wound and his own, with the felt cost that "the lotus-hearted ache remained." Every element serves this final, resonant shift in meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Causal lens is held perfectly. The plot progresses through a tight chain of discovery and realization: the fragment leads to memory, which unlocks the method, leading to the climactic action. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara’s internal state decisively changes with a felt cost, crystallized in the final image of her renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens. The visitor's question creates a pressure point, leading to a decisive choice (striking the nickel), which directly causes the series of awakenings. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, as Elara's understanding of her art and purpose is fundamentally altered, with the felt cost being the loss of her former comforting certainty. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal structure is flawless for its length, moving from setup (problem and tool) to execution (application and result) with clean, motivated logic. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is executed on the page with a clear conceptual cost—the introduction of a new, unpredictable chaos. The final image of the spark holding against the Harmonizer pulse provides a powerful and earned resolution to the scene's central tension, perfectly satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through recurring motifs—the postcard, the wind, the shell—that culminate in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where the poet finally sleeps, is achieved on the page with a clearly articulated cost: "Centuries of longing distilled into this." Orientation is immediate and the chosen lens is held without deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating on a Causal lens with beautiful precision. The plot progresses through a clear three-act escalation of stakes (Liora, Kael, Amaris), each requiring a more potent solution. The closure is a perfect example of Earned Stasis, landing with a clear cost and re-framing the central conflict without resolving it entirely, which feels true to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.6)
    The Causal drive lens is executed flawlessly; each of Elara's "promises" creates a direct, visible effect on the Veridian Knot, building a tight chain of escalation. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the knot unravels) combined with a Resonant Reconfiguration of her internal state, landing with the felt cost of her newfound humility. The structure is elegant and highly effective for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong (problem -> investigation -> discovery -> decisive change), and the closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively with a felt professional cost. The drive lens is Causal and holds firm. The plot’s primary weakness is the inciting discovery of the envelope, which relies on a convenient coincidence ("caught their eye") rather than a more active, character-driven search, slightly undermining the otherwise rigorous problem-solving narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory detail and thematic weight rather than linear causality. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara’s internal state shifts from paralysis to action, marked by the lifting of a physical weight from her chest; the cost is the very real risk she accepts by releasing the fragile archive into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, advancing the plot through an accretion of insight rather than external action. The closure is a superb example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); the final image of Elara bowing across the stabilized threshold lands with a clear, poignant, and earned conceptual cost—physical separation is the price of reunion and peace.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and symbolic imagery (feather) leading to a decisive choice (recalibrating lights). The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's perspective shifts, is achieved on the page with a clear felt cost—the abandonment of her solitary, intellectualized quest. The causality holds for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal structure with good orientation and a decisive closure. The critical flaw is the resolution of the central problem: after Elara's method fails, the cerulean sky-sparrow appears as a deus ex machina, conveniently delivering the exact solution she needs. In a Causal narrative, resolving a core conflict through coincidence rather than the protagonist's direct agency significantly undermines the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. Orientation is swift and clear. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively, reconfiguring Elara's state from one of preparation to readiness for her public performance, with the conceptual cost being the beautiful, ephemeral nature of her private creation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot follows the ritual's progression, with the "spontaneously anchored" moment serving as a perfect deepening of the stakes. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on the page with a clear, legible cost—the consumption of the moonstone and the transformation of her body into a static "map." The narrative logic is internally consistent and holds perfectly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is an internal journey that builds density and pressure through observation, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through memory and sensory detail, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building emotional and thematic weight toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

The structure is elegant and the closure is resonant and fully earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clean, compelling causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The setup, escalation with the resistant mirror, and climax are perfectly scaled for the word count. The ending delivers a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the ephemeral art creates a permanent shift in perception for the witnesses, and this closure lands with a clear felt cost (the widower's tears) and conceptual weight. The structure is elegant and flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal lens, where each beat logically compels the next. The structure is tight, with a clear setup, a single meaningful tightening (Kael's accusation), and a perfectly executed closure. The ending achieves a "Charged Poise"—the situation isn't solved, but the stakes are reconfigured with a clear, on-page cost, making the final image of the terrace as a "foundation" resonate powerfully. The story's architecture is impeccable for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmospheric and psychological pressure toward a single, decisive act. The structure is taut and purposeful for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building density until a decisive pattern break. The closure is a clean Decisive Change with a legible, if deferred, cost (the loss of safety). The causal chain holds, though the mechanics of "untangling threads" lean more toward the metaphorical than the procedural, which is a slight softness but acceptable for the story's lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is expertly handled for a reflection-led story, adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens. The narrative builds density through memory and sensory detail, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end.

The structure builds density towards the climax, where the gust of wind serves as the key pressure point. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the final image of the butterfly carrying the wing redefines the character's understanding of her mission with a clear, felt cost—the loss of her intended signal and her sense of control.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure with impeccable causality under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The plot progresses logically from discovery to execution to resolution. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the abstract concept of memory becomes a tangible, illuminated object, and Elara's internal state is reconfigured with cost (vulnerability, the sacrifice of the ephemeral light for permanent bronze). The final image lands with undeniable force.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) for its closure. The Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive lens holds perfectly: causal steps (dream -> numbers -> oak) are embedded in a texturally rich accumulation of decay and memory. The final action—using the seal—reconfigures the meaning of the directive, the bunker, and the protagonist’s curse into a new, resonant understanding. The cost is felt in the seal’s destruction and the acceptance of a new, less certain role.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to Causal for the climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the covenant, lands with significant felt cost as Kael's lifelong premise is overturned for a deeper truth. The final image of him extinguishing his candle provides a resonant reconfiguration of his relationship with the unknown, sealing the before/after change beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a clear orientation and a legible final change, but the causal link at the climax is critically weak. The resolution hinges on “shifting grace” aligning with the broken pin “exactly when required,” which functions as a deus ex machina. The rubric is clear that coincidence may complicate but not resolve; here, an external, magical event solves the central conflict, undermining Elara’s agency and the earnedness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved through a powerful and earned final image that redefines the protagonist's internal landscape. The cost—surrendering a rational, solitary methodology for a connective, intuitive one—is subtle but legible. The mystical causality of the climax feels coherent within the story's established tone and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through imagery and memory rather than a strict causal chain, which is highly effective. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the arrival of Liora. The cost is Elara's painful realization of her past rigidity. Liora’s sudden appearance is the only element that feels slightly convenient, but it functions as a resonance of Elara's internal shift rather than a cheap solution, keeping the structure sound.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The plot is not a sequence of events but a deepening of a central mystery, which is perfectly suited to the story's theme and length. The final on-page action of placing the cameo provides a resonant, circular closure that fulfills the narrative's premise with a clearly felt conceptual cost—the protagonist’s acceptance of his role in a "terrifying, beautiful" predetermined loop.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal lens is held perfectly. The plot progresses through a tight because/therefore sequence, from identifying the problem via the diary to paying the mountain's price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot functions exceptionally well under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through layered imagery and deepening understanding. The structure is tight, moving logically through the surreal space.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene causal structure. The inciting magical premise (the 13th hour) establishes the rules, which are followed consistently. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "absence" from betrayal to tragedy, is earned on the page by the protagonist's action and provides a decisive, resonant "before/after" state of knowledge. The cost—the loss of a simple narrative for a sadder truth—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Orientation is immediate and effective.

The causal chain is one of increasing sensory pressure leading to a textural transformation, which is perfectly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where the plot advances through a densification of resonant images and visions. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the beacon achieves a new, fragile life—lands with palpable emotional cost. Causality, based on the retrocognitive visions providing tactical knowledge, is perfectly coherent within the world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the plot unfolds as a single, coherent process. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with a clearly articulated emotional cost—the "sharper" ache of nostalgia—which is earned by the preceding events. The narrative drive, which comes from the deepening of mood and the crystallization of Elara's purpose, is masterfully handled from the storm's fury to the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.6)
    The structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural drive. It moves with a quiet, deliberate causality from observation to discovery to action, with each step deepening the protagonist's internal state. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s stance toward her craft and hope is redefined—is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost (the memory of her past tragedy) that gives the final, small flame immense significance. The lens is established early and held perfectly through the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is simple but potent: a retreat into a reflective space leading to a changed perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Accumulative-to-Causal structure. It establishes the tense atmospheric state, which then causes the protagonist to act, leading to a Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically enabling the next step in the quest. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the throne's status shifts from 'vacant' to 'guarded'—lands with a clear and felt cost (renunciation of power for duty). The plot structure is seamless and perfectly scaled for the story's length, making the final resonant image feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where pressure builds through atmosphere and emotional resonance rather than linear causality. The closure is a perfectly rendered Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the cost felt on the page in the "thinner" threshold and "more desolate" sanctuary. The lens is held with absolute consistency, and the final image is charged by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens from setup to resolution, with each beat logically following the last. The glitchy texts from parallel dimensions serve as a unique and compelling inciting incident that justifies the climax's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Hybrid lens (Causal discovery leads to an Accumulative/Conceptual closure). Orientation is excellent, and the final beat delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elara’s worldview and professional mission are reconfigured. The cost is the emotional work of processing another's story to re-contextualize her own grief, which feels earned and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story operates on a flawless Causal drive lens, where each beat logically compels the next, from the main team's capture to Kael's escape. The structure is a masterclass in economy, culminating in a closure that delivers both a Decisive Change (data sent) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (he returns to his ghost-like existence).

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood toward a final change, and orientation is clear. However, the closure unit fails the rubric's cost requirement; the narrative explicitly denies any cost with the line, "She had let go and gained everything."
