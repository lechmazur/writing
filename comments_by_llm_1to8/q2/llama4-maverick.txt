  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs with visible cost. Maria simply continues her work unchanged, and the final image of "quiet, incremental steps" carries no price or foreclosed path. The accumulative lens could support this structure, but without a density shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake, the ending dissolves into restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the accumulative structure coheres around discovery and artistic legacy, the closure lacks visible cost - the protagonist simply "feels peace" and "knows she has found her way" without sacrificing anything concrete. The patterns accumulate (frost, ledger, scorched testament) but never force a decisive trade-off or renunciation that would constitute true closure with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward resonance, but the closure lacks visible cost—the survivor simply "finds strength" without sacrificing or choosing anything concrete. The catastrophe that "rendered the world silent" is a major orientation gap that undermines stakes. The ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the music creation, but the "unshaken marvels" feel asserted rather than earned through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis closure with the undertaker finding peace as library guardian, but the journey lacks causal rigor—he descends, repairs the lens, and succeeds without meaningful obstacles. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The Accumulative lens holds but the single "tightening" (lens repair activating the signal) arrives without prior pressure or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure—it ends exactly where it began with Akira's determination unchanged. No on-page cost materializes; the sanctions remain abstract background. The piece reads as extended exposition about an ongoing situation rather than a scene with causal linkage or accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric buildup toward spiritual revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Aria's "newfound understanding" arrives without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The breathing exercises lead to enlightenment too smoothly, missing the resistance that would make transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes clear anchors (who/where/when) and maintains an accumulative structure building toward Elian's expanded perception of time. However, the closure lacks visible cost - Elian simply "integrates" the knowledge without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The transformation from maze designer to time-weaver happens without dramatized struggle or price, making the ending feel unearned despite the conceptual ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows a simple quest structure (find message → locate vault → distribute seeds) without meaningful reversals or complications that test the protagonist. No decisive change occurs on-page with visible cost; the ending summarizes years of impact rather than dramatizing a closure moment. The "chained liberator" setup never pays off - we don't see what chains them or how they break free.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lyra's technical work building toward the crystalline sound's capture—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her grief work. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("a battered marvel") but the actual price of imprinting this sound remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    No genuine closure occurs - Lumina simply continues their journey with vague promises of future discovery. The story lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The accumulative buildup (moonbeams, codes, destiny whispers) never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Elian simply continues their established practice without meaningful change or price paid. The "thawing" metaphor never crystallizes into a specific choice or renunciation. Setting and situation are clear but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs to create genuine closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost on the page - the protagonist simply decides to "walk out into a brighter future" without paying any price or foreclosing options. The accumulative build exists but the final transformation from shadows to light happens through declaration ("I was ready to face whatever lay ahead") rather than dramatized change with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve true closure with visible cost. The oracle completes her ritual and "succeeds in drawing a map," but this success is declared rather than demonstrated through changed options or felt consequences. The transformation of reality ("shadows rearranged into a new and mysterious pattern") happens off-page without showing what was sacrificed or how the oracle's stance crystallized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Zeta's realization about thoughts coming from "amalgamation of experiences" arrives without earned struggle or foreclosed options. The looped timelines are mentioned but never dramatized with specific cause-effect linkages that would justify the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve meaningful closure—the registrar reaches the same abstract realization ("freed by honesty") she held at the start without any dramatized shift or cost. The piece teaches no pattern for its repetitive abstractions about transparency and truth. While she "finds what she was looking for," this discovery occurs through assertion rather than earned transformation, with no visible price paid for her supposed freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on page; the story ends where it began with the dresser tending the garden. The piece reads as extended description under an Accumulative lens but lacks the density increase or pattern break required for that mode's closure. Cost remains abstract ("withered," "worn") without a specific price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a causal lens but the closure—Kaelin touching the nexus and experiencing sideways time—lacks visible cost or meaningful change beyond assertion ("she would never see the universe in the same way again"). The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The discovery feels unearned as no prior struggle or sacrifice leads to the breakthrough, just completing a repair task.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with visible cost. Rachel "uncovering secrets" and feeling "changed forever" occurs through assertion rather than dramatized transformation—no specific code is revealed, no concrete discovery shown. The piece teaches no pattern for its impressionistic approach, and the ending's "magic that lay just beyond the threshold of reality" provides only abstract resolution without earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost on the page. Aria's realization about truth's provisional nature arrives through accumulation but without dramatized consequence - she simply "vanishes into the landscape." The orientation anchors clearly (mountain weather station, oracle named Aria), but the accumulative structure drifts into abstraction without a decisive reconfiguration that makes before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres adequately with the logbook discovery serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that "reveals" the swallowed truth. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we understand something was hidden but don't experience the weight of that revelation. The radio program parallel enriches texture but doesn't fully integrate with the explorer's discovery to create undeniable pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.2)
    Critical failure: no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on-page. The chronicle keeper begins recording history and ends still recording history - the recursive structure creates atmosphere but no actual transformation with visible cost. The piece mistakes repetitive description for accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change with visible cost - Eli experiences wonder but no path forecloses, no price is paid. The "moment that would stay with Eli forever" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized transformation. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but doesn't culminate in a resonant reconfiguration that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Emilia's completion of her collection, but the cost remains entirely abstract. While the accumulative structure coheres, there's no visible price paid for her discovery—no sacrifice, no foreclosed option, no earned change. The phrase "memories of a world that had long since passed" gestures at weight but doesn't demonstrate it through concrete loss or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure lands on the page—the story ends with The Oracle continuing to write, exactly as they began, with only abstract claims about change rather than dramatized transformation. The piece lacks causal linkage between beats, proceeding through atmospheric description and repetitive assertions about mystery without any because/therefore progression. The orientation remains vague throughout (who is the stranger, what do the specs actually do, what change actually occurred?).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver genuine closure with visible cost. The ending claims transformation ("The world was a different place") but provides no concrete evidence of what changed or what was sacrificed. The "possession" threat appears late without setup, breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure occurs on the page—the writer "knows" they've become a conductor of symphonies but this is assertion without dramatized change or visible cost. The story follows an accumulative lens but fails to build density toward transformation; instead it loops through variations of the same nostalgic mood without meaningful escalation or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the protagonist's journey through mental labyrinth accumulating toward transformation. However, the closure—"she had conquered the labyrinth of self"—lands as declaration without visible cost. The transformation is stated but the price paid remains abstract, failing the cost proof test at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure occurs on the page - Aria simply "remained" in the same state she began. The piece lacks any Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending states "she was ready to face whatever lay ahead" but this resolution arrives through contemplation rather than dramatized pressure that forecloses options. The discovery of the laboratory creates potential stakes but never tests them through action or choice that carries price.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through sensory details and memories, but the closure—Elara finding "peace" and "understanding"—lacks visible on-page cost. The transformation from grief to healing happens through abstract realization ("she had finally grasped the impact of memories") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit with legible cost. The poet's "deep understanding" and continued wandering suggests Charged Poise, but the final state doesn't meaningfully reconfigure her options or demonstrate what she's sacrificed—she simply continues doing what she was already doing with vague enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where music transforms the "chronic hush" from oppressive to meaningful stillness. However, the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than visceral—we see connection formed but no clear sacrifice or foreclosed path that would elevate the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure occurs on the page - the dealer simply completes her work and leaves. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver any decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with cost. The ending merely restates the opening situation without transformation or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The friendship formation and community project planning constitute progression without meaningful closure - no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The accumulative lens could work but requires density increase or pattern break at closure, which doesn't materialize.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a straightforward accumulative structure but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - Kael simply achieves belonging without sacrificing anything meaningful. The orientation is clear but the causal linkage between finding the tag and suddenly creating transformative art feels unearned. The "luminescent ache" transforms to peace without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lyra accesses the hidden patterns and returns "forever changed," but the cost remains abstract - "some secrets were too great for mortal comprehension" tells rather than shows price. The accumulative lens holds but the mystical mechanics ("borrowing time from the giant") lack clear rules. Line 6's "sculpts time itself" contains a grammatical error that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where the conjurer's understanding shifts from seeking fixed mathematical certainty to embracing fluid emotional landscapes. However, the cost remains largely conceptual without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options, and the ritual's mechanics lack clear stakes or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the dweller's routine discoveries building toward a Charged Poise ending where their presence becomes "a whispered rumor." However, the cost remains abstract—we see the dweller retreat but don't feel what visibility would actually risk or what hiding costs them emotionally. The sense memory provides texture but doesn't alter present tactics or choices, functioning as isolated nostalgia rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—Emilia simply stands observing while the narrative asserts transformation through abstract commentary. The piece lacks causality (no because/therefore linkage) and reads as meditation without pressure. The ending claims she "had taken the first steps" but we never see what those steps are or what they cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost - the brooch "seemed to glow with an otherworldly light" is assertion without earned transformation. The accumulative pattern (following trails, decoding markings, exchanging art) builds competently but the final "sense of closure" and "threshed meaning" are declared rather than dramatized. The piece tells us about convergence's significance without showing its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost on the page. The final realization about "everyday magic" reads as abstract philosophizing rather than earned through concrete struggle. The piece violates orientation by never anchoring when or where beyond "mystical mountains" and "musical crystal cave."

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archivist gathering fragments to rebuild community memory, but the closure lacks visible cost - the installations succeed without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately. The pattern of collection-to-display coheres but the transformation from exile's end to community healing happens too smoothly without earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change with visible cost - Emilia enters seeking secrets and exits having found them without meaningful obstacle or price paid. The "knowledge she uncovered" remains entirely abstract. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to build density or create a pattern break that would constitute closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure unit with cost. Emilia completes her transcriptions and gains understanding, but this reads as successful completion rather than decisive change—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "entangled memories given voice" resolution is abstract declaration without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Kael discovers goodbye is transformation rather than cessation, with the duplicate serving as proof. The accumulative/textural lens holds as colors deepen and energy builds toward the spatial distortion. Cost is implied through the "mixture of wonder and trepidation" but lacks visceral weight—the transformation feels too smooth for an immortal confronting existential questions.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens with pressure building toward Lena's decision to act, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where she commits to the breach. However, the stakes around "political asylum for a client" remain vague and disconnected from the funeral home setting, creating causality gaps. The cost of their planned breach is declared but not felt on the page—we don't see what Lena specifically risks or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure with visible cost occurs on the page - the story ends with the stationer continuing her work unchanged. The accumulative lens holds but lacks the required resonant reconfiguration or decisive change. The piece reads as an extended scene of texture-collecting without transformation or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—the survivor simply completes their task and moves on. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to crystallize into a closure unit with visible cost. The ending merely states completion without showing transformation or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when the ephemeral compass "clicks into place," but the cost remains abstract ("secrets of the universe"). The accumulative build through whispers and resonant hums creates atmosphere but doesn't establish clear stakes or what changes for the protagonist beyond gaining knowledge. The orientation is clear but the closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure but lacks a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The resistance builds through graffiti messages, yet we never see concrete consequences or a specific moment where options narrow. The accumulative lens holds but the cost remains abstract—"ready to face whatever the future held" doesn't show felt loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost - Elara simply completes her mission and descends. The orientation is clear (lunar summit, photographer documenting flora) but the piece reads as a static vignette without meaningful change or reconfiguration. No decisive shift occurs between the opening scan and the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a true closure with cost—Emilia simply fixes the drone successfully without stakes, setback, or sacrifice. No meaningful change occurs between beginning and end; she starts calm and competent, ends calm and competent. The coincidental ship departure adds atmosphere but no causal pressure or thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver closure with visible cost—Emilia simply walks onto the ice toward an undefined discovery. The pattern on the glass provides a causal turn, but the ending offers only promise of future revelation rather than an on-page reconfiguration. No path is foreclosed, no price paid, just anticipatory language about mysteries ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece accumulates atmospheric texture but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The final line "the sound of a town reborn" declares transformation without showing concrete change or what was sacrificed. The revival remains abstract assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density toward closure, but the ending lacks visible cost—Kael succeeds completely and only feels "melancholy" without foreclosing any path or paying a price. The closure reads as completion rather than transformation, with "she had succeeded in her mission" stating rather than demonstrating change. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the crystal vial guides but doesn't limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes basic spatial movement through the prison but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. The ending merely continues exploration without achieving DC, RR, or CR - "the boy felt the story unfolding" provides no legible before/after. Who/where anchors are clear but the dominant stake remains vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the resonant awakening serving as closure, but the transformation lacks visible cost—the alchemist gains power without sacrifice. The ghost bride's "debt slowly being repaid" happens automatically without earned causality. Who/where/when anchors are established, but the closure reads as unearned gift rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—Aria completes a tapestry that glows, but this creates no before/after in her situation, knowledge, or options. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver cost: the weaving succeeds without obstacle, trade-off, or sacrifice. The ending merely restates the opening promise ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") without dramatizing what was foreclosed or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's "sense of cautious enchantment that would stay with her forever," but this lacks visible cost on the page. The excavation process accumulates detail without meaningful tightening or deepening that would narrow options or force trade-offs. The orientation is clear but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure effect occurs on the page—the story ends with Cipher anticipating future projects rather than resolving the current one. The piece lacks causality, reading as a static description of an activity without because/therefore linkage or meaningful escalation. The dominant stake (sending an encoded letter) never faces opposition or generates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The embroiderer completes the chart and "knows" they've uncovered secrets, but we never see what those secrets are or how they alter anything—the coup remains abstract future threat. The ending asserts transformation ("the universe itself were awakening") without demonstrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost on the page. "Aria knew that she had been changed by the encounter" tells rather than shows transformation. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but the final "testament to the power of evocation" reads as abstract assertion rather than earned resolution with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on page - Kael begins examining coral and ends in anesthetic haze with claimed peace. The "unknotting" and "grafting new meaning" are told abstractions without visible cost. Closure lacks the required DC/RR/CR with legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lena gathering inspiration leading to artistic creation, but the closure lacks decisive cost—she creates art and feels fulfilled without sacrificing anything tangible. The pattern of fog/decay/renewal accumulates adequately but the final "reborn, one brushstroke at a time" lands as assertion rather than earned transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena transforms the mural from static restoration to living art, with the cost being her abandonment of "certainty" for open-ended creation. The accumulative structure coheres through sound wave intensification and mirror arrangements building to the transformed mural. Minor deduction for the abstract nature of the "exchange" which could be more concretely dramatized, though the final image of becoming "one with the mural" carries sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with abstract legacy statements rather than a concrete change or reconfiguration. The accumulative lens could work but no density shift or pattern break creates the required before/after legibility. The thoughts-tax premise sets stakes but never tests them through dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver closure with visible cost. The ending merely restates the opening situation—the poet will continue creating as before—without any decisive change, reconfiguration, or price paid. The "renewed purpose" and awakening from rare slumber suggest change but don't dramatize it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure occurs—the caretaker continues her eternal task unchanged, with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The story operates as pure description of an ongoing state rather than dramatizing a before/after shift with cost. The accumulative lens could work, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's breakthrough, but the cost remains abstract - "symphonies of truth" and "restoring trust" lack concrete dramatization. The accumulative lens holds but the closure relies on assertion ("fabric of reality had been altered") rather than showing specific transformation. The orientation is clear but the ending's "paths diverging" metaphor feels unearned by the preceding scholarly work.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through discovery, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending states thematic resolution ("bound together by a thread of compassion") without dramatizing a choice, renunciation, or reconfiguration that forecloses options. The orientation is clear but the promised restoration conflict never materializes in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—Emilia simply continues her established routine with pigeons and dust-watching. The piece lacks causal linkage between her paper trail fabrication and any present consequence. Orientation anchors (vintage bookshop attic, pigeon trainer) arrive promptly, but the story operates in an Accumulative mode without density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine closure occurs—the father's sudden appearance and their reunion lacks causal setup and reads as wishful thinking rather than earned resolution. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to accumulate meaningful pressure or pattern that would justify the ending. The "necessary distances" concept never translates into concrete stakes or choices that would create visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page - the astrologer simply achieves their vague goal of understanding without visible cost or foreclosed options. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. The ending claims transformation ("forever changed") without demonstrating it through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist discovers paths disappear due to "flux and transformation," but this revelation lacks visible cost on the page. The discovery sequence follows convenient breadcrumbs (seeds → path → chamber → symbols) without meaningful obstacles or prices paid. The closure reframes understanding but doesn't show what the protagonist sacrifices or how this knowledge alters her future choices beyond vague intention to return.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    Fatal absence of closure - the story simply stops after another repetitive performance description without any decisive change or cost. The accumulative structure builds no pressure toward transformation. Multiple paraphrase loops ("orchestrated serendipity" appears three times verbatim) and the explain-everything ending about "creating connection" replace actual dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the verse appears "etched on her skin in a language only she could understand" without showing cost or transformation. The nostalgia ban setup never pays off causally. Accumulative lens suggested but the density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure, just asserts completion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure occurs on the page - the glazier simply walks away with unchanged options and no visible cost. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. The orientation is clear but the structure is static observation without the decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes a reflective journey but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Kael's transformation from "scarred firefighter" to "messenger" is declared rather than dramatized through specific action or renunciation. The final image of him disappearing into shadows with the box doesn't demonstrate what has changed or what price he pays for this enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. The vision builds density but doesn't reconfigure Aria's options or force a choice—she simply returns to arranging patterns with renewed purpose. The final "knowing she was exactly where she was meant to be" declares satisfaction without dramatizing what was at stake or what alternative path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost—the cartographer simply "finds peace" and "departs" without any decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing that would create a before/after. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague throughout, particularly the "climate shifts" timeframe that never clarifies its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with visible cost. The painter "succeeds" in making the mirrors show possibilities, but this achievement lacks concrete stakes or sacrifice—it simply happens through painting. The ending declares victory without dramatizing what was risked or lost, violating the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric build-up but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The negotiations reach a "breakthrough" but we never witness the actual change or its price—only abstract assertions about "redemption" and "hope rising." The ending provides Earned Stasis (Elian finding peace) but without dramatized cost or specific transformation of the conflict itself.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through environmental transformation (releasing waters), but the mechanism feels magical rather than causal—how does raising hands and an egg trigger water release? The "map drawn by cracks" appears only as explanation without prior setup. Cost remains abstract despite the dramatic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the courtesan's transformation, but the cost remains abstract ("all that she had lost") rather than visible on the page. The accumulative pattern of liberation imagery coheres, yet the actual price of defying conformity never materializes in specific losses or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Amaranth enters the dome to work and leaves having worked - no path is foreclosed, no options narrowed. The ending merely restates her unchanged mission without transformation or earned consequence. Who/where/when anchors are clear, but the accumulative pattern never crystallizes into a closure unit that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure unit lands on-page—Aria simply leaves after completing her structures with no decisive change, earned stasis, or reconfiguration. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight meaning. The moth wing glows "with an otherworldly light" twice without causal progression or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the rope's transformation, but closure lacks visible cost—Akira simply succeeds and feels satisfied. The piece reads more as extended description of a craft process than a story with stakes. No clear before/after change occurs beyond completing a task she set out to do.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Hindsight's dream journey building toward understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—the "heart filled with knowledge gained" and walking into "possibility" provides no decisive change or clear reconfiguration. The decaying directive concept never materializes into concrete stakes that test the character, remaining purely conceptual throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.2)
    While the accumulative structure builds atmosphere, there's no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page. The "covenant" and transformation remain entirely abstract - we never see what the astronomer sacrifices or how their world concretely changes. The ending declares transcendence without showing the price paid or options foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—listeners simply transform without resistance, and Elara walks away unchanged. Causality breaks when the broken music box mysteriously produces melody through walls without explanation. The "spell of persuasion" and "cellular memory" mechanics remain abstract concepts rather than dramatized events with clear cause-effect linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the twilight frost imagery and glass mountains, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mirror maker dissolves into her creation. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see transformation but don't feel what she loses beyond abstract "boundaries erased."

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending states accomplishment ("their actions a testament") rather than dramatizing change. No concrete before/after is legible—we don't see Elara's specific struggle or what the reunion costs either character. The orientation is clear but the piece reads as extended exposition rather than pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece attempts Conceptual Repricing through "nonlinear inheritance" revelation but the cost remains purely abstract - "they would never see the world in the same way again" tells rather than shows transformation. The accumulative structure builds imagery but the closure lacks visible stakes or concrete consequence beyond vague "purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts transformation ("no longer content to simply uncover knowledge") but this change isn't earned through dramatized causality - we never see Elara struggle with theory vs. application beforehand. The library discovery happens through convenience (pushing aside a shelf) rather than earned consequence, and no visible cost registers at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lyra discovering clues that build toward finding the Garden. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when she realizes the Garden is "not just a physical place, but a state of mind," though the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. The narrative threads metaphor provides coherent linkage, but the final arrival at the cove feels convenient rather than earned through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the rope pattern revealing "underlying truth," but no concrete cost lands on the page—Emilia gains understanding without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative lens wavers with causal intrusions ("As Emilia watched...she felt"), and the orientation remains functional but generic (university clock tower). The ending promises future exploration rather than delivering present closure with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mapkeeper studying ice patterns until achieving the bloom of hush, but closure lacks visible cost—she simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately. The transformation from cacophony to harmony occurs too smoothly without earned causality or meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the custodian discovering the shard and activating the orrery, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope blooms. However, the cost remains abstract—we see light and warmth but no concrete sacrifice or foreclosed path. The progression from shard discovery to orrery activation lacks causal linkage, reading more as sequential events than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric buildup toward the archivist's communion with collective memory. However, the closure lacks visible cost - she gains memories and purpose without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The transformation from "weight of her task" to "weight...lift" suggests resolution without demonstrating what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lyra gathering sensory impressions that culminate in creative renewal. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she simply feels inspired without sacrificing anything or foreclosing options. The transformation from hopelessness to creativity happens without a decisive change that makes before/after legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. While the chronicler gains "deeper understanding," this realization carries no stakes or trade-offs. The two figures' conversation resumes without consequence to the chronicler's journey. No path is foreclosed, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Eli's expanded perception and the "stretching of their previously contracted world," with emotional cost visible in the journey from claustrophobia to openness. The accumulative structure coheres as silence flavors build toward transformation. However, the cost could be more sharply felt - the ease of transformation undermines full closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure effect occurs on the page—the operator simply disappears into fading light after a day of unchanged drifting. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but accumulates description without pressure or meaningful deepening. The "mission accomplished" declaration has no earned basis since no transformation, choice, or cost manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a linear quest structure (Causal lens) with clear because/therefore linkage but lacks meaningful cost at closure. Aria simply sits on the throne and claims power without sacrifice or trade-off. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2, but the closure reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the keeper moves from isolation to reconnection, with the threshold revitalization marking the change. The accumulative structure holds, building through shadow imagery and memory. Cost remains somewhat abstract ("heavy with sorrow") rather than viscerally felt, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure lands with diamond creation as a Decisive Change, but the cost remains abstract - we see success without visible sacrifice or trade-off. The causal chain from messages to experimentation to diamond creation follows but lacks the intermediate struggles that would make the transformation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing but fails to show concrete cost - "they would never be the same" and "shape the world" remain abstract assertions without visible price. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a specific change with legible consequences. The "hidden truth" discovered remains entirely opaque, making the transformation weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure with visible cost—the knight "captures" the shape of possibility and gains "purpose," but what they sacrifice or how this changes their concrete options remains abstract. The transformation from withdrawn to purposeful happens without dramatized struggle or price, reading more as assertion than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. Emilia discovers the button, pieces together a soldier's story, and finds purpose, but this unfolds as steady progression without meaningful tightening or a before/after shift. The ending declares transformation ("broken heart slowly mending") without dramatizing the price of this change or what path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page—Aria simply vanishes at dawn without altering her situation or paying visible cost. The gathering scene presents exposition about resistance but no causal linkage that narrows options or forces choice. The story reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the prophecy is allegedly "hushed" but we never see its specific threat tested or the saxophonist paying a price. The story operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode but fails to land closure with visible cost. The final "peace" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the decoded prophecy and the sorter's transformation, the cost remains abstract and unspecified. The piece lacks concrete stakes or a clear before/after state—we never learn what the prophecy says or how it changes the sorter's options. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but doesn't narrow toward a specific pressure point with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric description building toward Elian's transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—he simply "smiled" and "disappeared into the shadows" without paying a price for his new understanding. The device creation and compass discovery don't causally link to create meaningful pressure or force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elara finds peace by accepting her journey's imperfections. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; we're told she's "at peace" without seeing what specific opportunity or relationship she sacrifices. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive moment where the weight of her choice becomes undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's spirit dissipates after confession, but the cost remains abstract ("luminous ache"). The accumulative structure works - whispers build to confession to release - yet the closure lacks visible price; we see completion but not transformation or genuine loss.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (trauma → forest journey → understanding) but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara's tears and "sense of peace" are emotional labels without specific price paid. The "mathematics of mercy" revelation remains abstract without concrete transformation. Orientation is clear but the closure's conceptual repricing lacks specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure with visible cost. Lena's decision to "continue to unfasten the anchors" presents no concrete trade-off or foreclosed path. The ending loops back to continuation rather than crystallizing change—she simply affirms what she was already doing.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration with Ezra carrying the "weightless burden" of stories, but cost remains abstract—we never see what she sacrifices or risks by engaging ghosts. The mainspring barrel's significance as "key" arrives without setup. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but doesn't crystallize into a decisive moment with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a closure with visible cost. The operator completes their project and "succeeds," but what is sacrificed or transformed remains abstract—"spreading ripples" and "changing reality" without showing concrete consequences. The pattern accumulates atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive change or reconfiguration with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (the defunct revolutionary "reborn as chronicler") with conceptual cost implied through "burnished sorrow," but the accumulative structure meanders through repetitive philosophical observations. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early but the cost remains more declared than felt - we're told about sorrow and transformation but don't witness the precise moment of foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the music box plays, but lacks visible cost—Erebus simply succeeds at his craft without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but doesn't narrow options or force meaningful choice. "The golden chip, now dimmer" suggests energy expenditure but this cost isn't dramatized or felt in Erebus's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward transcendent unity, but closure lacks visible cost—the protagonist achieves mystical union without sacrifice or trade-off. The journey from entering the lagoon to deciphering symbols to achieving unity progresses smoothly but each step feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, preventing orientation penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure lands on the page—Aria simply walks away "ready to continue her journey" without decisive change, reconfiguration, or visible cost. The story follows an accumulative structure but fails to crystallize into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts. The slide discovery and sculpture creation are told rather than dramatized, with no causal linkage between finding the slide and creating art.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Luna's art transforms, but the cost remains purely abstract - we never see what she sacrifices or struggles against. The accumulative structure works but lacks the "felt cost" required for closure; phrases like "deep sense of peace" and "profound understanding" substitute for dramatized price. The orientation is clear but the transformation happens to Luna rather than through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered discovery, but fails to achieve required closure—the ending merely promises future exploration ("knew that she would return...again and again") without decisive change or reconfiguration. No visible cost manifests on-page. The orientation anchors clearly (zeppelin library, Naomi as archivist), but the piece reads as extended setup without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the alchemist's contemplation building toward transformation, but closure lacks visible cost—the town "begins to flourish" without showing what the alchemist sacrifices or risks. The transformation from contemplation to action ("The time for contemplation was over") marks a shift but doesn't demonstrate a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the story establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration where archiving emotions triggers an "accidental prophecy," the cost remains abstract—we never see what specific price the scribe pays or what path is foreclosed. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but the closure lacks visible stakes: "The scribe's work was done, but the consequences of their actions were only just beginning to manifest" tells rather than shows the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the vortex inheritance as its central mechanism, building through visions to a responsibility-acceptance closure. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we understand she'll "spend the rest of her days tending" but don't feel what she sacrifices on the page. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands intellectually but lacks the immediate, embodied price that would elevate the ending beyond thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Ember shifts from warning systems to harmony, but the cost remains abstract—we never see what she sacrifices or risks by abandoning her original role. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks the visible price that would make the transformation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure occurs on the page—the janitor simply leaves at dawn carrying "renewed purpose" without any decisive change, earned stasis, or crystallized choice. The piece loops through variations of the same meditation (stillness, vulnerability, cosmic connection) without accumulating toward a reconfiguration. The yellow lantern glass moves from "precarious" to "prominence" but this physical shift carries no cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the recluse opening the box and absorbing the beekeepers' memories, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where they become "guardian of memories" with felt cost (tears, the weight becoming "part of their very being"). However, the tangled covenant mentioned as world-building never receives concrete dramatization or payoff, weakening causality. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending merely restates the timekeeper's continued journey without foreclosing any path or crystallizing a specific choice. While the damaged time capsule provides some structure, the piece lacks causal linkage between discovery and consequence—the timekeeper's "newfound understanding" arrives without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the poet's final state of connection, but no visible cost appears on the page—she gains insight without sacrificing anything. The accumulative structure builds through repetitive imagery (water lapping, mist, beauty, connection) but these repetitions don't escalate pressure or narrow options. The closure reads as assertion ("she knew that she had discovered something profound") rather than dramatized change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change occurs—the caretaker simply continues their work until death without transformation or meaningful choice. The story reads as extended exposition about completed actions rather than dramatized scenes with pressure. The copper wire innovation and orchard transformation are summarized rather than shown unfolding with obstacles or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page - the ending declares "convergence" and "new understanding" without showing what specifically changed or what it cost. The piece reads as extended setup for a transformation that never dramatizes. Accumulative texture builds but doesn't crystallize into a closure moment with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the land's transformation, but the cost remains abstract—"ravages of war" and "battle-scarred terrain" lack specificity. The accumulative pattern holds but without the visible, felt cost required for closure; we're told of healing but don't witness what was sacrificed or struggled against.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves basic causal linkage (orb→riddle→cylinder→spring discovery) but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost. Finding the spring brings "peace" and "purpose" but no concrete price is paid or path foreclosed. The "journey far from over" ending deflates rather than crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Aria simply walks toward an undefined "brighter tomorrow" without paying any price or making a meaningful choice. The accumulative build-up (gilded compass, sketching, flickering light) never crystallizes into a closure moment where stakes are transformed or a path is genuinely foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change (sky restored) but with no visible cost—the chess-swapping succeeds without obstacle, price, or sacrifice. The accumulative buildup exists but lacks the required "felt cost" at closure. The restoration happens too easily, reading more like checking a quest box than earning transformation through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story reaches Charged Poise at the ending ("poised on the threshold") but lacks visible cost—no one sacrifices, loses, or pays a price for this new alliance. The accumulative pattern of walking/words builds texture but never forces a genuine trade-off or foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a quest structure (search → find → transform) but the closure lacks visible cost - the seer gains reality-shaping power without sacrifice or trade-off. "She knew that she had created something new" tells rather than demonstrates the transformation's weight. The accumulative texture builds but doesn't crystallize into a decisive reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tutor decoding threads leading to the labyrinth, but the closure—emerging "reborn" with newfound peace—lacks visible cost on the page. The transformation from frozen village to stirring life happens without causal linkage to the protagonist's journey, and the resolution feels declared rather than earned through specific dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page - the artist simply "realizes" and "knows" through abstract revelation rather than earned transformation. The orientation remains vague throughout (when is this ritual? what canyon?). The accumulative texture attempts resonance but delivers only recursive description without genuine cost - "forged hush" and "peace" arrive without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ending but the cost remains abstract ("gift worth more than any amount of gold"). The central mystery of deciphering the statue resolves without clear stakes or consequences - we never learn what the patterns reveal or how they change Kaelin's situation. The breathholding frame creates false urgency that deflates when she simply surfaces without the discovered knowledge affecting her predicament.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. The painter's "promise to herself" and artistic legacy remain abstract concepts without on-page stakes or transformation. The cave discovery arrives as coincidence rather than earned turn, and the ending dissolves into summary ("Years would pass") rather than crystallizing a specific moment of change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—Elian begins and ends in the same contemplative state without foreclosing any path or paying visible cost. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to create density increase or pattern break that reweights stakes. The ending merely restates his contentment without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the navigator accepts loss and faces a new horizon, with cost visible in the "fragments of the old." However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized beats—the actual journey, the cryptic calls, and the reverse migration all occur in exposition rather than scene, weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the forager simply walks away with vague resolve. No clear drive lens emerges (appears Accumulative but doesn't cohere), and the orientation remains murky past 120 words ("the forager" has no concrete identity). The ending's "determination to forge a new path" provides no visible cost or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure—Kael simply picks up the boutonnière without any cost or transformation. The accumulative lens attempts to build atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts. The "investigation" promised never yields discovery, only circular speculation about borrowed memories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows a quest structure but lacks causal linkage between beats—following ants to a cavern feels arbitrary rather than motivated. The closure attempts transformation ("tears of joy and sadness") but this emotional shift isn't earned through prior dramatized struggle, only through discovery. The orientation remains clear but the "doorway of decisions" never materializes as actual choice-points, despite being repeatedly invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story promises revelation but delivers only vague assertion: "she found a truth that was both wondrous, and terrible." No actual change occurs on the page—the queen enters the grotto seeking answers and exits having "seen the secrets" without showing what changed. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a specific cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story reaches for a Resonant Reconfiguration where the alchemist "captures the density of presence," but this closure lacks visible cost or genuine transformation. The pattern of examination → inspiration → understanding proceeds without obstacles or trade-offs. The whispered phrase functions as convenient catalyst rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward the end, the closure lacks visible cost—the narrator simply declares satisfaction and peace without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The "chronologically confused" setup never pays off causally; the confusion resolves without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs—Elara begins reflecting in the shop and ends still reflecting, with no altered options or foreclosed paths. The story lacks causal linkage, reading as meditation without escalation. The claimed "trembling calm" and "deeper understanding" have no visible cost or concrete manifestation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration where writing transforms internal scars into external stories, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure builds texture through meditation, whispers, and writing, yet lacks a decisive moment where Kaito pays a visible price. The line "carrying Kaito's stories into the unknown" gestures at change without demonstrating what was sacrificed or fundamentally altered.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with visible cost—Lyra sends her message but we never see Astra's response or any concrete change in their relationship. The "sense of hope rising" and "peace settling" are unearned assertions without dramatized transformation. The piece teaches mystical communication early but the ending merely declares success without showing the reconciliation's actual texture or price.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode but fails to deliver a clear closure with visible cost. While Aria "completes" her journey and the universe is "restored to balance," this resolution occurs through abstract assertion ("she knew that the cosmic illusions had been unraveled") rather than a dramatized change or reconfiguration on the page. The piece lacks concrete causality—we never see how reading the dictionary or walking actually accomplishes the spiral arbitration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure occurs—the story ends exactly where it began with the shepherd watching clocks, creating a static loop without any decisive change, earned stasis with cost, or resonant reconfiguration. The piece reads as an accumulative/textural attempt but fails to build density or break pattern in ways that would reweight the central concern about time's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure—Lena's "breakthrough" and "understanding" remain entirely abstract without concrete change or cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the piece never moves beyond contemplation into actual event or decision. The ending declares transformation through summary ("she knew that she was ready to revolutionize") rather than demonstrating it through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    No on-page closure with visible cost—the story ends with Elara's resolution to help but no actual change, test, or price paid. The piece reads as extended setup without the decisive moment where theory meets reality. Accumulative lens suggested by repetitive reflection, but no density increase or pattern break creates the required reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page—the story ends exactly where it began with another loop iteration. The "teaching endings how to begin" never manifests as concrete action with visible cost. Drive lens remains ambiguous (possibly Accumulative) but the closure merely restates the opening situation without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure occurs on the page—the story dissolves into summary about "years later" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The piece reads as pure Accumulative/Textural but never achieves the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The archivist discovers a locket photo and documents the jetty, but these actions don't link causally or build toward any crystallized ending moment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a true on-page closure with visible cost - Raven simply watches community form and walks away feeling peaceful. This reads as Accumulative/Textural lens but the density increase doesn't reweight stakes meaningfully. The moon rock's "mystical properties" setup never pays off causally, creating an unkept promise.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration at the stillpoint where the mapmaker gains "understanding," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds as musical notes guide the journey, yet the transformation from external quest to internal revelation lacks concrete stakes. No specific loss or trade-off makes the "before/after" legible beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Aria transforms from interpreter to editor, with visible cost in accepting the garden failure as necessary. The accumulative structure builds coherently through pen restoration, garden metaphor, and reality-editing. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt—the "strange comfort" and acceptance feel somewhat abstract rather than embodied at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the central act of translating silence into music, with the vintage camera and sign language building toward a resonant reconfiguration where the harbor is "forever tuned to the frequency of their music." However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt - we see transformation but not what was sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    No genuine closure occurs on the page—the story ends with Elian leaving, having created art, but without a decisive change or reconfiguration that carries visible cost. The piece reads as extended exposition about past events and future discoveries rather than present dramatization. Causality is loose throughout, with Elian's actions (creating art) disconnected from any immediate pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Aria's moment of dissolution and vision, but the cost remains abstract ("auroral sorrow," "fleeting moment"). The accumulative texture builds adequately but the closure lacks visible, felt cost - we're told about "entangled memories" fading but never see what specific loss this entails. The orientation is clear but the stakes remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The protagonist "proves her point" about whispers, but this validation occurs without stakes or transformation—she simply demonstrates something she already believed. The key discovery suggests future possibility but doesn't resolve or reweight the present action. Causality is loose: the connection between finding the coin, following the map, discovering the key, and meeting the stranger feels arbitrary rather than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.4)
    No causal linkage exists between events—the figure arrives, displays patterns, speaks of secrets, then leaves without any because/therefore progression. The story lacks a closure unit with cost; it ends exactly where it began with the guardian watching water. "Teach darkness the value of stars" appears as unexplained abstraction without dramatized meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Elian simply returns to coaching "with newfound purpose" after the town transforms. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment where something is genuinely at stake or lost; the "humble rebellion" succeeds without opposition or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's call triggering Kael's transformation into a sea guardian—a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost ("weight of her past begin to detach"). However, the transformation happens too smoothly without resistance or complication, and the specific nature of her past burdens remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—it ends with atmospheric description ("darkness deepened") rather than Echo making a choice or experiencing a reconfiguration. The accumulative texture builds somewhat but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts decisively. The final paragraphs dissolve into abstract commentary about "possibility" without dramatizing any actual change or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver closure with visible cost—Lyra's transformation occurs through abstract "dissolving boundaries" without concrete consequence or foreclosed options. The orientation is clear but the ending merely restates the opening's promise without decisive change or reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost - the "bartered awakenings" concept never manifests in concrete exchanges or prices paid. Causality drifts as the painter arranges plants without clear trigger, and the courtyard's transformation happens through summary rather than dramatized beats. The closure celebrates imperfection but shows no before/after that forecloses options or exacts payment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure lands on the page - the story literally stops mid-sentence with "However, to meet the word count, we will stop here and conclude." The accumulative build never crystallizes into a Resonant Reconfiguration or pays any visible cost. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve valid closure with visible cost. The ending presents emotional renewal without dramatizing what was sacrificed or overcome—the jewelry maker simply "felt a sense of peace" after the curtains illuminate. The origami-to-star-alignment causality feels arbitrary rather than earned, and the "timeless observatory" setting evades temporal anchoring that would create pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story accumulates atmospheric detail but fails to achieve closure with visible cost. The cartomancer's "journey" ends exactly where it began—studying cards in her loft—without any decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The promise of "uncovering hidden narratives" never materializes into a specific discovery or renunciation that would create a before/after legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the historian's transformed perception, but the cost remains abstract—we're told she's "forever changed" without seeing what she's lost or gained concretely. The accumulative texture builds through "atoms of nostalgia" imagery but doesn't cohere into a decisive change with visible stakes. The mystical experience with the pagoda feels unearned, arriving as magical solution rather than culmination of established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves pattern density but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending states intention ("she was ready") without dramatizing the actual metamorphosis or its price. The shadow revelation provides conceptual repricing but remains abstract. Orientation anchors clearly (library, dusk noticer, post-dream-sharing world) though the actual stakes emerge slowly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure lands on the page—the story ends with Lena continuing to work, having achieved only abstract understanding without a decisive change or reconfiguration. The mysterious "con" that supposedly triggers everything is never explained or connected to concrete stakes. The piece reads as pure accumulative texture but fails to achieve even a resonant reconfiguration because no specific pressure forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story reaches for a Resonant Reconfiguration ending but the cost remains abstract—"stories in scars" and "mysteries in tissue" never crystallize into specific, felt consequences. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but doesn't tighten toward a decisive moment. The orientation is clear but the closure lacks the visible price required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost—the crystal gazer simply absorbs "unused love" without consequence or change. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment. "The love that would continue to resonate through the ages" is abstract assertion rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward liberation, but the closure lacks visible cost—creativity simply becomes "freed" without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation is asserted rather than dramatized, with no clear before/after that shows what the dreamer gives up or risks to achieve this freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Asa merging with the dune as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract ("now a part of the dune's very fabric"). The closure reverses itself when she re-solidifies and walks away unchanged, undermining the transformation's weight. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the philosopher's journey deepening through sensory accumulation, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending merely returns to "wind rustling through trees" without transformation or reconfiguration—no before/after is legible. The translocation sequence adds texture but doesn't alter options or crystallize stance. Missing orientation anchors (when/why he's there) and no felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ending reaches a threshold but lacks a decisive change or reconfiguration with visible cost on the page. "Embarked on the next stage" and "new and uncharted world" promise transformation without delivering it. The accumulative build creates atmosphere but never crystallizes into a specific moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with on-page cost. The ending states "their silence a reminder of the strength that lay within" but this realization isn't earned through dramatized pressure—it's asserted. The orientation anchors (cobalt fortress, bellhop, snow) arrive promptly but the actual situation remains vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure—the pretender is "unmasked" and their "facade crumbled" but we witness no specific change, only summary. The extended setup (Kael preparing for months) consumes most narrative space without building toward a dramatized confrontation. Cost remains entirely abstract ("exposed and vulnerable") without concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's realization that "truth...was not in the maps or the data, but in the rhythms of the sea itself," but this arrives through summary rather than dramatized discovery. The accumulative structure coheres around observation and rhythm, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Who/where/when are anchored adequately early.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost—the protagonist simply receives renewed purpose through mystical vibrations without sacrifice or genuine struggle. The accumulative texture builds adequately, but the transformation from lost to purposeful happens through external magic rather than earned internal change, and no path is genuinely foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Akira unseals the embryo and accepts her destiny, but the cost remains abstract - "a journey that would reshape the world" tells rather than shows. The accumulative lens holds but the closure lacks visible price; I cannot point to a specific sentence where cost becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Amira moves from seeking solace to finding her "pearl of stillness," with the photograph's physical transformation (crumpled to smooth) marking the internal shift. The accumulative structure coheres well, building density through landscape description and bodily response, though the cost of her healing journey could be more viscerally felt rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered metaphors, but closure lacks decisive on-page cost—the artist simply "vanishes into shadows" without forfeiting anything concrete. The untangling action provides some progression, yet remains largely metaphorical rather than creating actual before/after change. Orientation anchors (lighthouse library, portrait artist) arrive adequately early, though the piece relies heavily on abstract conceptual work over dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending's "gentle echo of the secrets they had uncovered" provides no concrete transformation or price paid. Causality breaks when Kael suddenly achieves understanding through mere touch. The lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density creates meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where hidden truth transforms society, but the cost remains abstract—we see "outrage and curiosity" but no specific price Aria pays. The accumulative build works but lacks the concrete, felt consequence required for higher scores; "her conflicted heart now at peace" suggests resolution without dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a closure unit with visible cost—it ends in contentment without any decisive change, crystallized choice, or meaningful reconfiguration. The piece reads as extended description of an established state rather than dramatized events. No causal linkage drives the narrative forward; we observe Aria's routine without witnessing pressure that would force adaptation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the fisher's journey building atmospheric density, but closure lacks decisive cost. While she "hears" the goddess's echo and feels renewed, no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed—she simply departs enriched. The orientation is clear (fisher in sound wave garden seeking goddess), but the ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration without visible price, only abstract "renewal."

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure occurs on the page—Adelaide merely formulates a plan and descends into mist. The story ends at the moment it should begin, with no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing. "Proof by contradiction" is named but never enacted. The piece reads as extended setup without the promised confrontation or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with "meteor hush" and atmospheric layering, but lacks a clear closure with visible cost—the tattooist "vanished into the dawn" without dramatized consequence or foreclosed path. The orientation remains vague throughout (what exactly is a "laboratory of lost sounds"?) and time-folding occurs abruptly without setup or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The artist "discovers meaning in the mess" through passive observation of her mandala, but no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration occurs on the page - she simply feels peaceful without earning it through action or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria discovering the tessera, experiencing a vision, and renaming the plaza—but the closure lacks visible cost. The renaming attempts a Conceptual Repricing but remains abstract ("a promise of a new beginning") without showing what Aria sacrifices or how the act changes her options. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Echo finds peace, but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere effectively, yet the closure lacks a decisive on-page moment where the price of her peace becomes undeniable. Lines like "Echo felt a sense of peace settle over her" summarize rather than dramatize the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Luna's artistic process building toward transcendent creation, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending celebrates achievement ("sense of peace," "harmony with the world") without showing what was risked or lost. The geode enables discovery but no before/after transformation is legible—Luna simply continues what she was already doing with enhanced results.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - Aria simply feels "contentment" and "peace" without earning this transformation through dramatized struggle. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes manifest. The final "companionship" with the cave network arrives without price or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration—the turner simply continues working as before, with no cost paid or path foreclosed. The canyon echo's release and button cataloging create atmosphere but don't alter options or knowledge. The ending merely restates the opening situation with added abstraction about "shared wisdom" without demonstrating what was actually gained or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the spy meeting her lost self, but this closure lacks visible cost on the page. The transformation from searching to finding happens through convenient discovery rather than earned causality. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established, but the drive lens wavers between Causal and Accumulative without clear commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmosphere accumulates effectively, the story lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The "palimpsest promise" remains unexplained abstraction, never dramatized. The ending's "world full of possibility" and "spindrift serenity" reads as asserted resolution without earned transformation—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver closure with visible cost. Akira's "newfound understanding" that places resist change due to kindness arrives as unearned insight without dramatized discovery or sacrifice. The ending merely restates the premise without transformation—she walks away with the glass as a "reminder" but pays no price for this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs - the gardener simply continues gardening with added philosophical overlay. The "quivering hush" repeats without accumulating pressure or forcing choice. The lockmaster's tooth introduces late complexity that never pays off in action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—Lyra simply continues her work and goes to sleep without any cost paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative lens could apply given the meditative tone, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake. The orientation is clear but the causality is static: she polishes, reflects, and sleeps with no because/therefore linkage or meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves basic orientation but lacks a genuine closure with visible cost. Lena's realization about connection manifests only as abstract understanding—"she felt a sense of peace settle over her"—without dramatized consequence or foreclosed options. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into the required decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Lyra sends a counter-signal and "reports of strange occurrences dwindling" but this resolution arrives through summary rather than dramatized consequence. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in lens but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The orientation is clear but the closure merely declares victory without showing the price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory details building toward revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Lyra gains cosmic insight without sacrificing anything concrete. The transition from seeking "lost chronicles" to finding a "vital key" as abstract understanding needed more causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters achieve mutual understanding, but the cost remains abstract ("thawing a part of the detective's heart"). The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final transformation lacks concrete stakes - we never see what specific cold case or human cost drives this awakening, making the ending feel unearned despite its poetic language.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure - it ends with Emilia continuing research toward future revelation rather than achieving transformation. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a specific cost or reconfiguration. Lines like "The answer...remained shrouded in mystery" explicitly defer resolution beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page; the fiddler simply plays music and walks away. The "pixelated amnesty" concept floats without causal linkage to any concrete action. The story consists of abstract declarations about transformation without dramatizing any actual event or choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Kael accepts the circular nature of paths with visible cost (his startup's failure). The accumulative structure coheres as memory and present observation interweave. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, and the reflection-heavy middle section (lines about investors, territorial markers) dilutes present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Lyra simply continues working with renewed purpose, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes transform. The orientation is clear (observatory, night, decoding work) but the recursive meditation on "shared burdens" loops without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the druid discovers "what mirrors don't show" is "a glimpse into the soul" but this abstract revelation carries no visible cost or consequence. The narrative follows a simple linear path (enter vortex → find frozen figure → touch mirror → continue journey) without meaningful causality or escalation. The ending merely restates the beginning with the druid continuing to walk forward, ready for future discoveries rather than completing this one.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Aria enters the maze seeking "the intersection of dreams" and exits having "found" it, but this discovery manifests only as vague visions and abstract declarations ("the future was hers to shape"). No concrete choice is made, no path is foreclosed, no price is paid. The accumulative lens might apply, but density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure—the ending merely restates the opening's mystical promise.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration ending where the idealist transforms both herself and the orchard. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she simply "feels peace" and walks away "smiling" without paying any price for her transformation, violating the cost requirement. The spell-weaving sequence builds texture but never crystallizes into a moment where something is genuinely lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Jack's "spark of determination" and decision to "find a way" is intention without action or consequence. The phone call provides minimal pressure that doesn't escalate or force a meaningful choice. No clear drive lens emerges; the piece wavers between causal and accumulative without committing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Elara simply "feels wonder" and is "ready" without any price paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative texture builds adequately but never crystallizes into a moment where something is genuinely at stake or lost, making this more meditation than story.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the librarian simply continues their eternal duty unchanged. The piece reads as extended description rather than story, with no causal linkage between beats and no visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost - Aria simply "feels peace" and carries "latent radiance" without sacrificing anything concrete. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment where Aria must choose or lose something tangible. The pearl's discovery and its effect remain abstract metaphors without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Emilia's decision to follow the overgrown path as an act of self-forgiveness, with the accordion's "raw solace" providing felt cost. However, the accumulative/textural lens relies heavily on reflection and metaphor rather than dramatic pressure, and the closure's cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful cost at closure—the dreamer simply realizes the library is metaphorical and walks away "forever changed" without showing what specifically changed or what was lost. The accumulative/textural lens could work, but the density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure; instead, we get abstract assertions ("state of being") that don't reweight prior material. The orientation remains fuzzy throughout (when/where is this mist-shrouded city?).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a clear closure with visible cost - it ends on abstract promise ("emerge transformed") rather than dramatized change. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment. Who/where/when are established, but the actual stakes and what Elian specifically decides remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Aria's spirit "taking flight," but this transformation lacks visible cost on the page - she simply completes her task and transcends without sacrifice or renunciation. The accumulative lens holds but the piece never establishes what Aria risks or loses. The "threshold of stillness" concept floats without concrete stakes or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—Aria simply continues tending the grotto as before, now with "understanding." No concrete cost is visible at closure. The story operates in an Accumulative mode but fails to build density or create a pattern break that would reweight meaning. The "cycle of rebirth" remains abstract philosophy rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward the unhooking of doubt, but closure lacks visible cost—the client simply gains "newfound understanding" without sacrifice or trade-off. The conscience's work completing feels declarative rather than earned through dramatized change. No concrete before/after is legible beyond abstract statements about certainty becoming less suffocating.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns building toward understanding, but closure lacks visible cost—the student simply "understands" without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The meditation-teaching frame holds but never tightens into genuine pressure. No decisive change or reconfiguration occurs with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.4)
    No closure effect occurs on the page—the skimmer continues sitting and resonating exactly as it began, with no decisive change, earned stasis with cost, or reconfiguration. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. Critical orientation failure: the skimmer's nature, capabilities, and relationship to physical reality remain opaque throughout ("harmonic stone skimmer" could be sentient rock, alien device, or metaphor).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Eira finds renewed purpose through the keystone, but the cost remains abstract - we're told she feared creative death but never see what she sacrifices or risks. The accumulative build through exploration-discovery-activation follows clear causality, yet the transformation lacks visible price. "Brilliant dimness" as oxymoron doesn't substitute for dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael's descent into deeper understanding, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where "the color of sound" shifts from abstract concept to perceived reality. However, the cost remains abstract—"he would never see the world in the same way again" declares change without showing what he sacrifices or how this knowledge burdens him. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the "fulfillment of purpose" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized transformation. The backwards prophecy concept never manifests as concrete stakes or choices, remaining abstract throughout. Causality breaks when drinking a distilled coin essence somehow reveals cosmic truth without established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallization of echoes building toward contemplation, but lacks a decisive change or reconfiguration with visible cost. The reaper performs their ritual and feels "peace," but no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no price paid on the page. The ending merely affirms the eternal status quo ("The reaper's journey continued") without transformation or earned stasis that would constitute valid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the bell's restoration, but the cost remains abstract ("brittle devotion") rather than felt. The accumulative structure coheres around the dripping ritual, yet lacks the density increase or pattern break that would create genuine escalation. Orientation is clear but the cosmic imbalance never gains concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure lands on the page - the story ends with abstract promises about "stories yet to be told" without delivering the forgotten memory or showing any actual healing. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment or reconfiguration with cost. The piece teaches no pattern for its repetitive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara perceives the hidden language in the starlings' patterns, but the cost remains abstract ("thrilling and unsettling"). The accumulative build works, yet the ending lacks a concrete price—she simply continues her work with stored knowledge rather than facing a genuine before/after shift with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure - Lyra simply completes her work and feels accomplished. No visible cost manifests on the page; "preserving trust" remains abstract without a test. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to deliver the required density shift or cadence break that would reweight the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with meditation as frame, but closure arrives through assertion rather than earned change. "He felt a sense of clarity and purpose that he had never known before" declares resolution without showing the specific cost or trade-off. The orientation anchors (floating dojo, Kaito, meditation context) land clearly, but the transformation from numbness to aliveness lacks the concrete mechanism that would make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story presents an Accumulative/Textural structure but fails to achieve closure with visible cost. The proprietor receives seed, contemplates it through the night, then designs a new escape room theme—but this sequence lacks causal linkage (why this seed triggers this response) and the "resolution" carries no stakes or sacrifice. The piece reads as extended reflection without a decisive change or reconfiguration that would constitute valid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The resolution ("the household would flourish") is asserted rather than dramatized, and the final paragraphs dissolve into summary without a specific image that reweights prior material. The orientation anchors (who/what/why) remain vague throughout, particularly regarding the "household" and its occupants.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward a state of "peace," but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks visible cost—the guardian's "responsibility" is simply "lifted" without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation from anxiety to understanding happens through passive revelation rather than causal pressure, and no path is foreclosed with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure lacks visible cost - we're told "the world was forever changed" and "a new path had been forged" but see no concrete price paid or option foreclosed. The transformation happens through assertion ("And then, in an instant, it was done") rather than dramatized change with legible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Aria's new understanding, but the cost remains abstract ("weight of the Hollywood star fragment still resonating"). The accumulative pattern coheres but lacks a decisive moment where Aria pays a visible price or forecloses an option. The orientation is clear early, supporting the atmospheric build.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure lands on the page—Elara simply "embarks on the adventure" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The story ends at the threshold of action rather than after it, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The accumulative lens suggested by mystical descriptions never coheres into pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the architect's discovery of "the texture of connection," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative structure builds appropriately, yet the closure lacks visible stakes - what exactly has she risked or lost in this revelation? The orientation is clear but the transformation feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure occurs on the page—the story ends with Lyra watching students disperse and feeling pride, but no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration happens. The piece reads as extended exposition about teaching navigation without a causal chain or accumulative pattern that creates cost. The "unfolded horizons" remain abstract future possibility rather than dramatized present change.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the sister's reunion/closure moment, but the cost remains abstract—"peace settling" without visible price. The causal chain is weak: Aria follows pulses → finds woman → provides comfort → woman achieves closure, with no meaningful complication or earned transformation. The mystical premise ("when the dead call") is declared but never tested against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a retrieve-and-escape plot without meaningful complication or cost. The phase transition travel through cables appears suddenly without established mechanics, breaking causality. No decisive change occurs—Lyra gets what she came for without sacrifice or transformation that's dramatized on-page. The "crashing hush" and emergence lack the weight of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure moment (releasing the porcelain shard) attempts resonant reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Akira gains understanding without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative structure coheres but the transformation from seeking to finding feels unearned without intermediate pressure that changes her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the creation of a new language, with conceptual cost in preserving what would otherwise be lost. However, the accumulative build lacks sufficient density shifts or pattern breaks in the middle sections, reading more as elaboration than escalation. The who/where/when anchors are adequately established early.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or clear closure with visible cost. Lena listens to confessions on a phone, feels some energy shifts, then walks away with "determination" - but no actual choice is made, no path is foreclosed, and the "frostbitten hope" resolution arrives without earned causality. The lens appears Accumulative but the density never builds to a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with cost - the statues simply awaken and celebrate without any price paid or path foreclosed. The transformation happens TO them rather than through agency. No persistent constraint shapes tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves basic closure through successful delivery but lacks genuine cost—the mailman crosses the border without consequence, obstacle, or sacrifice. The "linking absences" method is mentioned but never dramatized as creating actual risk or requiring trade-offs. Causality holds but remains surface-level: mailman has package, crosses border, delivers it, feels satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward a lyric resonance, but the closure lacks visible cost—the carpenter simply returns to work "infused with newfound purpose" without sacrificing anything concrete. The encounter with the singer creates mood but no decisive change; the carpenter questions if it was imagination, yet nothing in their tactics or options shifts. The "hidden truth" discovered remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the librarian's success in reawakening stories, but the cost remains abstract—"if only for a little while" gestures at impermanence without dramatizing it. The accumulative structure builds through repetitive descriptions of her work, yet the transformation from dormant to awakened stories lacks concrete manifestation beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure lands on the page - the story ends with "ever beckoning" and "remained a mystery," refusing resolution without earning stasis through visible cost. The accumulative texture builds but never crystallizes into a decisive moment or resonant reconfiguration. The piece teaches no pattern that pays off, merely cycling through variations of the same dawn ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the freed lock releases its trapped idea as "shimmering light," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative structure coheres through symbolic layering, though the stakes ("enveloped secrets") stay abstract. The orientation anchors (locksmith, nexus, twilight task) arrive clearly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Emilia simply walks away "ready to face whatever lay ahead" without any actual change, renunciation, or crystallized choice. The piece reads as extended setup without the required tightening or deepening that would narrow options or force a trade-off. The "decades later" frame promises retrospective significance but never delivers the actual memory recovery or its consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archivist gradually uncovering the shadow's secrets through tea leaf analysis, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where they unlock the path to reverse the exile. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told the archivist has "done their work well" but don't witness what was sacrificed or risked in this delicate task. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established adequately by the 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure with cost—Aria plants a seed and "weaves reality," but no before/after change occurs with visible stakes or sacrifice. The accumulative texture builds but never crystallizes into a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The world transforms without earned causality or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated silence and spirit dissipation, but the cost remains abstract—we see spirits merge with silence but feel no concrete loss or transformation in the restorer. The accumulative lens holds but lacks the density shifts or pattern breaks that would create meaningful escalation. The ending's "sense of purpose" arrives without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful cost—Elara discovers "secrets" and feels peaceful, but we never learn what she found or how it altered her options. The orientation is clear but the closure merely asserts transformation ("she had finally found a piece of herself") without dramatizing what changed. No visible price is paid for her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. Eli's realization that "the physics of letting go was not about severing ties, but about embracing the fluidity of existence" is abstract philosophy without dramatized consequence. The final image of weight "settling like snow" attempts resonance but lacks the decisive change or reconfiguration required—Eli leaves essentially unchanged despite claims of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the balladeer simply leaves after creating graffiti, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The story operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would constitute closure. The "forever changed" courtyard is asserted without showing how or at what price.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated understanding, but the cost remains abstract—"something that would stay with her forever" lacks visible price. The accumulative structure coheres but the transformation from "prison" to "sanctuary" feels unearned without concrete stakes or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure - Lyra simply continues observing and reflecting without any event that alters her options or understanding. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. No visible cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed portrait mirroring the sky, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive tightening—the demolition deadline creates external pressure without forcing a meaningful choice. The coin's "cryptic message" about limits never crystallizes into specific constraint or enables concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The accumulative structure builds through discovery layers (luminance → hopscotch patterns → hidden code → new map), but closure lacks definitive cost. While "ready to set course for the unknown" suggests Charged Poise, the actual reconfiguration remains abstract without concrete stakes or sacrifice. The piece teaches its pattern of discovery but doesn't fully pay off the accumulated pressure with a decisive change or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael discovering the hall of mirrors as a Conceptual Repricing moment, but the cost remains abstract—"secrets within their grasp" without demonstrating what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The orientation anchors (lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen library) establish early, yet the closure lacks visible price: Kael gains understanding without losing anything tangible or making a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a genuine closure unit—no decisive change occurs through character action, only a described transformation via magical energy. Causality is weak throughout: Aria decides to harness nebula energy without dramatized catalyst, settlers decode messages without shown struggle, and the resolution arrives through unexplained energy pathways. The piece reads as extended exposition rather than dramatized scene, with no visible cost paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful event—the adjuster simply performs routine maintenance and whispers a lullaby without any stakes being tested or options foreclosed. The "completion" of the task doesn't constitute closure since no path was at risk, no choice was made under pressure, and no cost is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands with the labyrinth's reactivation serving as a Decisive Change that guides travelers to safety, fulfilling the causal chain from blueprint discovery to restoration. The cost appears as "treacherous terrain" and implied danger, though it could be more visceral. The because/therefore linkage holds: nut leads to memory, blueprint enables understanding, marking stones reactivates mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maria gaining insight from nature patterns, but the closure lacks visible cost—she simply feels "peace" and "purpose" without sacrificing anything concrete. The transformation from grief to scientific breakthrough happens through reflection loops rather than dramatized pressure. No actual choice forecloses a path; Maria receives enlightenment without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Ember simply "smiles" and knows she's "found her true place" without foreclosing any path or paying any price. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes manifest, failing the closure requirement entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara moving through fortress to pavilion, accumulating sensory memories toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she absorbs stored remorse. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"sandpapering rough memories" lacks visible consequence. The orientation is clear but the closure, while present, doesn't show what Elara sacrifices or how the absorbed memories change her beyond generic "newfound precision."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a closure with visible cost—Emilia simply succeeds in her abstract goal of "bridging silos" without sacrifice or transformation. The conversation with the grain elevator never crystallizes into specific stakes or consequences. The ending declares success ("efforts had borne fruit") without showing what changed or what it cost, violating the requirement for on-page closure with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with cost—Elara becomes "the archeologist of abandoned dreams" but this reads as fulfillment without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The orientation is clear but the ending offers only thematic summary ("The experience had changed her") rather than dramatized transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (doodle leads to grotto, grotto reveals tomes) but lacks a decisive change with visible cost at closure. The archivist gains knowledge but no path is foreclosed, no price is paid on-page. The ending promises future action rather than delivering present transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric repetition and imagery building toward the sculptor's music creation. However, no genuine closure occurs—the sculptor simply continues their work and leaves, with no decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or resonant reconfiguration. The "forever changed" grove assertion lacks dramatized proof of transformation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but fails the cost test - I cannot point to any sentence where the price of exile or transformation is legible. The piece lacks basic orientation anchors (what is the magnetic nexus? what was the eclipsed covenant specifically?). The accumulative lens holds but without meaningful deepening; the tutor simply walks away unchanged despite claims of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elara reads a diary and feels peaceful, but no path is foreclosed, no choice crystallizes, and no price is paid. The "urge to recover secrets" leads to opening a friend's private diary without permission, yet this betrayal carries no consequence or internal reckoning. The promise of "new understanding" remains abstract without dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Lyra's transformed understanding, but the cost remains abstract - we see her peace but not what she sacrificed for it. The accumulative structure coheres around the corpse flower's blooming, though the "turning of the tide's thought" mechanism feels imposed rather than organic to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure lacks visible cost - Lyra discovers the echo pool and understands the orchard's resilience, but pays no price for this knowledge. The story follows a discovery plot without meaningful stakes or transformation. The accumulative texture builds but doesn't culminate in a resonant reconfiguration with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure lands on the page—the investigator simply leaves with vague "determination" and unspecified "next move." The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver any resonant reconfiguration or decisive change. "She was one step closer to understanding the truth" is pure summary without dramatized discovery or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with visible cost. The "moment the chisel struck" creates a sensory climax but no decisive change or reconfiguration occurs—Elian simply leaves "with a heart full of music." The piece lacks causal linkage between the song, the marble striking, and any transformation beyond abstract assertions about "certifying wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the flute-playing as the central transformative event, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the keeper emerges "forever changed." However, the transformation itself occurs in abstract terms ("navigating unseen paths," "uncovering secrets") without concrete dramatized cost. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) are established early, and the closure lands with implied cost through the "changed" state, though the specific price remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Echo's moment of clarity about grasping "the mathematics of emotion," but the cost remains entirely abstract—we never see what Echo sacrifices or risks. The vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure without clear consequence. The closure lands conceptually but lacks the visible or felt price required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The encounter between Eira and the aurora-woman suspends time but leads only to vague "wonder and connection" without altering Eira's options or requiring sacrifice. The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake—instead offering abstract assertions about "coaxing wonder" without dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the mystic "knew that she had uncovered a profound truth" but this revelation lacks specificity, cost, or dramatized transformation. The story declares multiple epiphanies ("truthful lies," "hidden connections") without showing what changes in her options or knowledge. Causality is absent: studying frost patterns somehow leads to communion with the world, but the mechanism remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending dissolves into abstraction ("her spirit remained, a gentle presence") without showing what actually changes. The orientation remains vague—we never learn who the loved one is or why the distance is "impossible."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - the apprentice's arrival merely extends the status quo without forcing choice or sacrifice. The accumulative pattern of transformation metaphors builds adequately but never crystallizes into a moment where something is genuinely at stake. No path is foreclosed, no price paid for the sword's creation or the knowledge transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails to deliver a legitimate closure with visible cost. The "truth" the protagonist discovers is never revealed or made concrete - we get only "she knew that she had finally uncovered the secret" without any specific transformation or price paid. The accumulative journey leads to an empty epiphany that could be inserted into any story.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the skipper accepts his role as protector with the "luminescent ache spread through his chest" marking emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as imagery layers (sea glass, cairns, ache) build toward this reconfiguration. Minor orientation wobble with the anonymous letters subplot that doesn't fully integrate.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—the herald simply completes her routine ritual as she presumably does every dawn. The piece follows an Accumulative lens but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would create closure with cost. The ending merely restates the cyclical nature established at the start without transformation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with cost. Kaito's understanding "expands" and he gains "clarity," but these remain abstract assertions without concrete stakes altered or paths foreclosed. The ending provides thematic summary ("The secrets...were slowly revealing themselves") rather than an on-page closure unit with felt or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric buildup, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration with visible cost. The sextant is repaired and the worker gains understanding, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The ending dissolves into abstract meditation ("thread in the intricate tapestry") without the required on-page cost or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks genuine closure with visible cost. The memory keeper sings, plants respond, darkness recedes—but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "realm beginning to heal" arrives without the protagonist sacrificing anything or facing a decisive choice that would constitute proper closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elys discovering wisdom through paradox, but the closure lacks visible cost—the "newfound peace" arrives without dramatized transformation or sacrifice. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately, yet the central discovery ("truth is not in the answer, but in the question") reads as philosophical assertion rather than earned revelation through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - the narrator simply "smiles" and plans to return without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive change or genuine reconfiguration with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page change or meaningful escalation - Elara discovers patterns and feels satisfaction, but no path is foreclosed with visible cost. The piece reads as accumulative/textural but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes shift. The ending assertion that she "carried with her a piece of that beauty" occurs without dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story reaches a vague resolution where "fragile understanding" replaces conflict, but no decisive change occurs on-page with visible cost. Lena's "mission to capture the sound of trust breaking" succeeds somehow, yet we never see trust actually break or understand what this means concretely. The watch fob's secrets remain unexplored despite being the inciting motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Aria connects with the weather-carrier, but the cost remains abstract ("futuristic nostalgia," "peace") rather than concrete. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the transformation from skeptic to believer happens instantaneously without earned causality - the compass vibrates, she follows it, touches a hand, and understands everything.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystalline imagery building toward creative breakthrough, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation of the lock at the end feels unearned and magical rather than causally linked to her artistic act. Setting anchors (subterranean crystal cave) are clear, but the resolution reads as wish-fulfillment without price.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration when Aria discovers the repository and gains "newfound purpose," but this lacks visible cost - she simply reads conversations and emerges enriched. The accumulative structure builds detail but doesn't tighten pressure or force meaningful trade-offs. No stakes are foreclosed; Aria gains wisdom without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece lacks any causal chain or meaningful plot progression—it's purely descriptive meditation without a decisive change or earned transformation. No actual event occurs; Aria simply incorporates an iceberg fragment into her sculpture while the narrative makes abstract claims about "the era after words." The ending offers no on-page closure with visible cost, merely repeating that the bluff "remained" as it was.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Aria finding peace via the controlled burn, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The accumulative structure works through repetition of key phrases, yet the transformation from containment-as-duty to containment-as-healing lacks intermediate steps that would make the shift feel earned. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—Emilia simply returns to her routine enriched by knowledge. The investigation unfolds through convenient information-gathering without obstacles or stakes. The locket-writer connection feels forced rather than causally earned, and the "listening heals" resolution states rather than demonstrates its theme.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with visible cost. Aria simply walks out at the end without facing resistance or paying a price for her escape. The coded journal and dice patterns accumulate but never crystallize into a decisive change or reconfiguration that would satisfy closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from whale beaching through coffee ground divination to memory recovery, but the closure lacks visible cost—memories simply return without price or transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens suggested by crystalline imagery and "gleaming silence" doesn't cohere with the linear quest structure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure lands on the page—the summoner simply "feels satisfaction" without demonstrating what changed or what it cost. The prophecy threat remains abstract ("great imbalance") and its hushing occurs through vague "mapping silence" without concrete consequence. The piece teaches no pattern for its accumulative repetitions, making them ornamental rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the meteor shower and rooftop setting building atmosphere toward the seal's transfer. However, the closure—passing on the seal as a "reminder"—lacks visible cost or meaningful reconfiguration. The student's transformation is asserted ("would never see the world in the same way again") rather than demonstrated through a decisive change that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Lyra's transformation is asserted ("she emerged stronger") rather than demonstrated through a specific choice or renunciation. The orientation is clear but the ending dissolves into abstract claims about readiness and hope without a concrete reconfiguration that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the forger simply completes her commission and leaves satisfied. The story follows an accumulative/textural lens but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes with cost. The ending provides Earned Stasis (she completes her work) but without visible price or foreclosed options. Who/where/when anchors are clear, but causality remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - Aria simply continues her journey unchanged. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts decisively. The ending's "voice that was both her own and yet not her own" gestures toward transformation but doesn't land it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page - Aria simply "vanishes into the night" without altering her state or foreclosing any path. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The vision sequence provides backstory about an unnamed woman but doesn't change Aria's present options or knowledge in any legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but fails to establish visible cost. The "profound understanding" she grasps remains entirely abstract—we never learn what hidden pattern was revealed or what it costs her to know it. The accumulative texture builds adequately but resolves into vague enlightenment without stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story reaches a location (the stillpoint) but lacks a true closure with visible cost - Aria simply stands "poised on the threshold" without decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration. The causal chain (following paper trail → reassembling letters → finding diamond/stillpoint) is mechanically complete but the ending provides no earned transformation, just arrival at "the beginning of her journey."

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.4)
    No closure occurs on the page—the visionary simply "disappeared into the dawn" without a decisive change, earned choice, or visible cost. The story summarizes decades of societal transformation through passive observation rather than dramatizing any specific causal moment. The accumulative lens could work but requires actual accumulation of pressure, not this retrospective summary of off-page events.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through captured sounds and memory, but closure lacks visible cost. The poet finds renewed purpose and begins writing, yet this Resonant Reconfiguration occurs without sacrifice or foreclosed options—he simply starts writing again after remembering his role. The orientation is clear but the "gleaned redemption" promised in the text never manifests through earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a form of Earned Stasis - Azure Coat successfully protects the artifact through vibrational matching. However, the cost remains abstract ("knowing that the artifact was safe, at least for now"). No concrete threat materializes, no sacrifice is made, and the "sonic absolution" concept never develops beyond mystical terminology. The accumulative texture builds but doesn't culminate in a decisive reconfiguration with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the mapper raises her hands, the viaduct glows, then she walks home feeling peaceful. The "revolution has begun" is declared but not dramatized through any visible transformation or cost. Causality breaks when the viaduct mysteriously responds to her presence without established mechanics. The lens remains ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative density builds toward closure).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains conceptual rather than visible on the page. "She was no longer controlled by them" declares transformation without showing what specific path was foreclosed or what price was paid. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final beat lacks the decisive cost required for closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the accumulative structure builds toward the chaplain's renewal, the closure lacks visible cost - he simply decides to return with renewed purpose without sacrificing anything or facing a genuine test. The wrongly imprisoned young man backstory dominates without anchoring in present action. The piece teaches no clear pattern for its heavy reflection mode, violating BRR limits at ~40% reflection without micro-choices altering the present.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.8)
    The bell rings in paragraph 24, but this "closure" carries no visible cost—Zephyr simply succeeds through persistence. The story declares the bell "unheard by any" yet claims Zephyr "felt deep within her mechanical heart," creating a logic break. The accumulative pattern exists but doesn't reweight meaning or extract price. Who/where/when anchors are established early.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with recurring numbers building pattern density, but closure lacks decisive cost—Lena's "transformation" and "newfound wonder" assert change without showing what she sacrifices or how her options narrow. The revelation that files are "simply archived" deflates rather than crystallizes stakes. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the crystal reconstitution serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that "maps empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart." The closure lands with conceptual cost ("the burden of her role as guardian"), but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt through specific loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated imagery (ice, endings, fragility) that reweights the opening death-wish, but the cost remains largely conceptual. The transformation from death-seeking to life-acceptance happens through reflection and metaphor ("sound of approaching endings") rather than dramatized pressure that would make the cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve closure with legible cost. The sentinel's realization about "destined mismatches" creating beauty constitutes attempted Conceptual Repricing, but no actual price is paid—she simply sits contentedly without foreclosing any path or facing consequence. The fragment discovery initiates wandering that leads to philosophical musing, but this chain lacks the pressure or narrowing options required for meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration—the line walker begins wanting to preserve wisdom and ends having preserved it without obstacle or cost. The "who/where/when" anchors blur (what is a "murmuring pavilion"?). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to accumulate pressure; each beat restates the same calm without deepening or shifting the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure effect lands on the page—Luna takes photos and leaves without any decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. The piece reads as extended description without causal linkage or meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward the scholar's decision to testify. However, the closure lacks visible cost—we see resolve but not what the scholar sacrifices by leaving. The "weathered innocence" awakening and city's "symphony of new beginnings" feel unearned without showing the price of abandoning isolated safety.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve required closure with visible cost. The prophet arranges driftwood, feels a presence, then walks away "with a sense of resolution"—but no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The pattern of fog/memory/longing accumulates without crystallizing into a moment where options narrow or meaning reweights with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a true closure with visible cost—Eli simply gains insight and continues his work unchanged. The earth tremors arrive without causality and resolve without consequence, serving as convenient pressure that doesn't genuinely test the protagonist. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Emma's death arrives without struggle or meaningful choice from either character. The "flawless goodbye" never encounters friction or requires sacrifice. The piece reads as a static vignette where the ending was predetermined from line one, with no tightening of options or deepening that changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure lands on the page - the story ends with Lyra continuing to work without any decisive change or reconfiguration. The "understanding" of the clockwork key (line 19-20) is abstract assertion without dramatized discovery. Accumulative structure fails because density never increases toward a crystallizing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Emilia simply walks away with newfound purpose, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The "substitute body" backstory fragment creates orientation confusion without serving closure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the tooth discovery leads to reflection but doesn't narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure lands on the page - the ending merely restates the opening condition ("heart remained still"). The piece lacks any Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the star watcher begins and ends in identical tranquility without visible cost or transformation. The accumulative texture doesn't build toward pressure but cycles through synonymous descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Aria simply decides she's "ready to face whatever came next" without earning this shift through concrete action or renunciation. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to create density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The viral confession backstory never connects causally to the present garden scene or the figure's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts Accumulative/Textural progression but the closure (writer's block resolved, words flowing again) arrives through mystical intervention rather than earned transformation. The woman's appearances don't create genuine cost or force difficult choices. No visible price is paid for the breakthrough - the "turmoil" simply dissipates without concrete sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—villagers simply smile and disperse without transformation or price paid. The device's activation and communal singing create atmosphere but no stakes are tested or options foreclosed. "Newfound sense of connection" declares rather than demonstrates change.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-making building toward enchantment completion, but the closure lacks visible cost—Aria simply succeeds and vanishes. The piece teaches its magical system adequately, yet the transformation from creating patterns to enchanting the plate feels mechanically sequential rather than pressurized. No meaningful obstacle or reversal tests Aria's commitment, making the ending feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. Elian repairs the device and feels satisfied, but this resolution lacks visible stakes or transformation—nothing was truly at risk. The "harvest of echoes" concept never materializes into concrete pressure or choice, remaining atmospheric decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a genuine closure with visible cost - the weaver simply completes her tapestry and disappears. While accumulative pieces can build to resonant reconfiguration, this ending merely restates the opening's mystical tone without transformation. The "weights of different burdens" remain abstract throughout, never crystallizing into specific stakes or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the widow working through grief via repetitive ritual, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she finds "a way to honor her loss." However, the cost remains abstract—we see her complete the carving and feel peace, but the specific price paid or path foreclosed isn't legible on the page, violating the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final photograph that "captures the fractured stillness," but the cost remains abstract ("reconciling eroded ambitions"). The accumulative structure works—fragments build toward the scavenger's self-recognition—yet the closure lacks specificity about what exactly is lost or gained. Lines like "they had found a measure of peace" tell rather than demonstrate the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Maya simply fixes pipes and walks away without facing meaningful opposition or paying a price. The restoration happens too easily through unexplained technical competence, and the "maze of intentions" setup never delivers causal pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elian decides to reconcile his naturalist dreams with his clock scribe duties, but this shift occurs entirely in abstract reflection without visible cost. Lines like "He realized that it was not too late to make amends with his abandoned dream" tell rather than dramatize the change. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where Elian must forfeit something or face concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The discovery of the sundial and Lyra's supposed self-realization lack visible stakes or consequence—she simply finds the object and experiences vague "clarity." No path is foreclosed, no price paid, making this a soft resolution without the required decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page - the collector decodes the rope then walks away unchanged. The story lacks causal linkage between discovering the pattern and any consequence or cost. The closure merely restates the opening state ("secrets waiting to be uncovered once more") without transformation or earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and atmosphere building toward a moment of understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—the thread breaking releases "a tiny puff of dust" without clear stakes or sacrifice. The transformation from oppressive silence to "otherworldly music" happens through assertion rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the prince's emotional and mechanical work building toward world transformation, but closure lacks visible cost on the page. The final line claims "deep, abiding peace" and world rebirth without showing what the prince sacrifices or loses—the transformation reads as pure gain. The device assembly progresses without causal linkage between discovery and outcome, and the world's "rebirth" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria moving from lagoon contemplation through a rescue call to tree-grafting, returning to peaceful resolution. However, no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—Aria ends essentially where she began, "gracefully alert" by the water. The grafting succeeds without complication or cost; no path forecloses. Orientation anchors clearly but closure lacks the required visible price or transformed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (breadcrumbs → hidden door → box → memories released) but the closure lacks visible cost. The fountains' revival and Aria's vow to be guardian happen without showing what she gives up or how the liberated memories change her options. The Accumulative lens could work given the breadcrumb-following method, but the ending doesn't crystallize with sufficient pressure or price.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure effect occurs on the page—the sentimentalist simply continues existing in the nebula with unchanged options and no decisive action. The piece reads as pure Accumulative/Textural but fails to deliver the required density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that would reweight stakes. The narrative drifts through repetitive descriptions of cosmic beauty without any causal linkage or meaningful turn that would create a before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterflies, ribbon, and poem accumulating toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carver discovers "the shape of collective grief." However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt on the page—we're told she finds peace but don't see what specific path is foreclosed or what price she pays for this understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Elara simply walks away feeling hopeful after reading inscriptions. No actual choice forecloses a path or changes her options. The accumulative pattern doesn't culminate in a resonant reconfiguration but rather dissolves into abstract assertions of future redemption without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The gardener's "newfound understanding" and "sense of purpose" arrive without transformation or sacrifice—they simply continue tending graves with "greater tenderness." No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the ending merely restates the opening with elevated language.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails to deliver required closure - it ends suspended in eternal potential ("the pen hovered, still, poised") without the pen actually meeting the page or any decisive change occurring. This violates the core requirement for on-page closure with visible cost. The accumulative build creates atmosphere but never crystallizes into the promised transformative act.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when dust particles align into "tangible, if ephemeral, storyform" with Emilia's satisfaction as emotional cost. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than dramatized - we're told the dust "would now begin to tell its own stories" without seeing this tested. The accumulative lens holds but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive closure with visible cost. While Lena gains philosophical insight about impermanence, this realization doesn't foreclose options or exact a price—she simply performs her job as usual. The ending attempts Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("a poignant reminder") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael excavating ruins and contemplating narratives, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending positions him "contemplating the long, hard road ahead" without a specific renunciation or crystallized choice that would constitute Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The chronometer cog and excavation create atmospheric pressure but don't culminate in a moment where options narrow or meaning decisively reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page. While it accumulates atmospheric detail around the zither and library, no actual transformation occurs - Emilia simply continues her existing work. The ending merely restates her devotion without showing what has changed or what it costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The celestial alignment creates atmosphere but doesn't force a choice or change. The sprouting seed and "new story growing" ending provides hope without visible price—no path is foreclosed, nothing is sacrificed. The orientation is clear but the promised transformation from "ruins to rebirth" occurs without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.2)
    No closure with cost lands on the page—the story ends with the toll keeper standing "vigilant" in abstract satisfaction without any decisive change or reconfiguration. The beehive "failure" resolves into vague "repurposing" and "resilience" without dramatized consequence. Causality breaks when the cryptic riddle "When shadows dance, light reveals" somehow leads to understanding without shown connection.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eli's gradual discovery building toward understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—her being "forever changed" is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific loss or transformation. The orris root shard's "shard of hush" property sets up expectations that don't clearly pay off in the ritual's mechanics or outcome. While a Conceptual Repricing occurs (house as living entity), the conceptual cost remains too abstract to land with force.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost - the statue's "satisfaction" and the garden's transformation occur without stakes or sacrifice. The piece violates the orientation test, never anchoring a specific when or establishing clear spatial choreography. The "cascading revelations" are summarized rather than dramatized, with no because/therefore linkage between discovery and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs—the narrator remains bound to the staircase in the same state as the opening. The ending attempts Earned Stasis but lacks visible cost; "content to be bound" arrives without dramatized struggle or foreclosed alternatives. The piece teaches no clear pattern for its repetitive structure, making the accumulation feel arbitrary rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The painter continues painting as before, with only abstract assertions about "bringing strangers together" - no actual transformation occurs on the page. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design but fails to achieve closure with visible cost. The thawing reveals bread sculptures and family histories, but Elena makes no choice, pays no price, and undergoes no transformation—she simply continues as "guardian" without earned change. The orientation is clear but the ending offers only abstract intention ("continue to be its guardian") without a decisive moment or reconfiguration that would satisfy closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a straightforward quest structure (enter lighthouse, find stone, solve puzzle, gain power) without meaningful reversals or complications that test the protagonist's commitment. The closure lacks visible cost - he gains "latent radiance" without sacrificing anything concrete or facing a genuine before/after change. The transformation is declared rather than dramatized through specific losses or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    No clear closure occurs - the protagonist simply leaves with unchanged circumstances and a vague warning. The story follows a Causal lens but lacks because/therefore linkage between beats. The "terrible revelation" promised never materializes on page, and no visible cost or decisive change marks the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern-building, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—the prophet simply "vanishes into the shadows" without transformation or consequence. The orientation anchors clearly (prophet, orchard, blue hour), but the ending provides atmospheric fade rather than the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-reading building toward discovery. However, the closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration—Lyra simply walks toward the watchers without transformation or visible cost. The crack/discovery beat provides escalation, but the ending dissolves into abstract continuation ("And as she walked, the watchers watched") without the required on-page closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost on the page - Emilia simply walks away "satisfied" without demonstrating what was sacrificed or transformed. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final image ("carried the truth back into the world") abstracts rather than crystallizes the cost. The orientation anchors clearly but the causality between finding the letter and understanding the truth remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through layered absences toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the surveyor becomes part of the interlaced absence they study. The orientation anchors clearly (surveyor, submerged pavilion, after drawbridge rises), and the closure lands with conceptual cost—the surveyor leaves the inkwell behind, accepting their own eventual absence. Slight deduction for the abstractness of "wrestled a piece of the past into the present" which tells rather than shows the specific achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration - Elara simply continues doing what she was already doing (studying texts, making annotations). No visible cost appears on the page; her "transformation" is asserted in line 15 ("Elara realized that she had been changed") rather than dramatized through concrete shifts in behavior or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends in continued work rather than transformation or crystallized choice. The accumulative/textural lens is evident but the ending merely extends established patterns without the required resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing that would make a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve meaningful closure—Amira's transformation from victim to purpose-driven researcher lacks visible cost on the page. The final "she would never be the same again" is pure telling without a decisive change or reconfiguration. The progression from drone strike to floating observatory to data analysis feels mechanically sequenced rather than causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing ("frequency of belonging was...a sense of connection") but lacks visible cost—Lena simply realizes something and walks away satisfied. The accumulative build through discovery feels mechanical rather than pressured. No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the "missing piece within her all along" reads as unearned wisdom without dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the protagonist simply decides to continue her search without any transformation of options or visible cost. The "sieved hush" concept is explained but never constrains choices or creates concrete obstacles. Most critically, the ending's "truth that was to come" promises future action rather than delivering closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated atmosphere but lacks visible cost—the negotiations simply flow to completion without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative structure works but the resolution feels unearned when parties suddenly cooperate after weeks of deadlock, with no dramatized breaking point or price paid for breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves basic coherence but lacks a decisive on-page change with visible cost—Jack simply paddles out and feels better through repetitive emotional assertions. The "navigating by utility poles" technique appears suddenly without setup or consequence, and the resolution relies on abstract declarations of hope rather than a dramatized shift that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—Lena simply walks into mist holding a baseball, with no on-page cost or foreclosed path. The ending "And then, she was gone" evades closure entirely. The accumulative lens could work but requires density increase or pattern break that reweights stakes, which never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but closure lacks visible cost - Lyra's transformation is described as "expansion" and "growth" without sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The ritual succeeds too smoothly; no meaningful complication or price is paid for reforging a bond beyond death. Orientation is clear but the phoenix rises reference and fortune cookie feel ornamental rather than causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final understanding that "lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories," but this arrives through abstract realization rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern but lacks concrete stakes or a clear before/after change beyond intellectual epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aurora stitching photographs leading to dimensional opening, but the closure—while present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—lacks visible cost on the page. The line "she knew that she had fulfilled her purpose" asserts completion without showing what was sacrificed or transformed. Orientation anchors clearly (recycled spaceship, storage bay) but the mechanism of how stitching opens dimensions remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a clear closure with visible cost. The ending states transformation occurred but doesn't show what Aria lost or gained specifically—the "whispering hush revealed its secrets" remains abstract without concrete consequence or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from blackout to revolution, with the sentinel's discovery and activation of the cradle serving as a decisive change. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the revolution succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off, reading more like wish fulfillment. The orientation anchors (fort, twilight, sentinel) land clearly, but the transformation from individual discovery to fort-wide revolution happens too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres as the herder progresses from searching to finding to arranging to revelation, with the vision serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral - we see completion but not what was sacrificed or foreclosed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost. The poet reads a letter and achieves "understanding," but this resolution is asserted rather than dramatized—we never see what the letter contains or how it transforms her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story promises a philosophical duel but delivers a generic sword fight where "the hidden overture was revealed in all its glory"—without showing what that overture actually is or how it matters. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost: Aurélien simply wins, reflects briefly, then walks away unchanged. The causal chain from sewing needle card to coded sundial to victory remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear accumulative structure building toward library restoration, but the closure lacks visible cost—the poet simply begins work without sacrifice or trade-off. The piece teaches its lyric mode early but the final "phoenix from the ashes" lands as assertion rather than earned transformation with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with visible cost. The pianist's transformation from sorrow to acceptance happens through declaration ("her heart was no longer heavy") without a decisive change or reconfiguration that makes before/after legible. The film world sequence provides texture but doesn't alter her options or force a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria uncovering and preserving memories until the monsoon arrives, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending states her work is "complete" and memories are "safe" without showing what specific price she paid or path she foreclosed. The pattern of memory-gathering accumulates but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes transform.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kaito processing grief through ritual actions, but closure arrives through summary ("felt a sense of peace settle over him") rather than a dramatized moment with visible cost. The lace-weaving sequence promises specificity but delivers only abstract color symbolism without showing how this particular pattern-making transforms his stance toward the severance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (the orchard's rebirth) that lands on the page with a felt cost—the statues' transformation and Luna's departure. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation achieved through the increasing density and power of the music. A minor deduction for a late-breaking rule: the statues' transformation, while thematically fitting, is not explicitly triggered by a new musical tactic but rather by the music's general intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot progresses with clear because/therefore linkages. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing with a visible cost—the weight of his task is "momentarily lifted," implying the enduring risk.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens, oriented early (greenhouse after a flood) and sustained. Closure is a conceptual repricing—decay and cosmic order unify—yet the cost is light and largely asserted. The scene’s arc is more meditation than turn, with one continuous cadence. Still, the final image coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images (frost, stars, ledger) build to a quiet reconfiguration where she reframes her role. Orientation is solid early, and the closure lands as a resonant repricing rather than a decisive act. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing old identity), but it’s faintly rendered, keeping the cadence shift from truly gripping. Beat progression is largely flat with one late reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres and escalates by density—device activation, fork selection, discord, then “rectify” toward a charged cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a completed “symphony of silence” and the departure into cold with carried music. Cost is modest (enduring an altered world; choosing felt vibration over sound), which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal spine is clean: package → journey → repair → signal shifts → guardianship. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with the undertaker choosing to remain as guardian. However, key pressures (the descent, repair risk) are summarized, softening cost on the page. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean and the piece holds a single-scene accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a quiet reaffirmation (Charged Poise) with the bell’s echo, but the cost remains largely implied. There’s no decisive turn or pressure that narrows options within the scene. The structure is coherent yet low in causal torque.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene layers atmosphere and ritual (breathing) toward a quiet reconfiguration (“the love you seek is within”). Who/where/when are anchored early; structure stays single‑scene and coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, though the cost is soft. The pilgrim’s guidance is the clearest causal nudge within the lyric build.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a Charged Poise: Elian poised to integrate the fragment’s knowledge into their craft. Orientation is clean and the escalation from image → glow → reverie is coherent. The closure’s cost reads conceptual (becoming a participant, retrocognitive disorientation) but not materially felt. Stronger on cadence-shift than on decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    Accumulative lens fits the summary cadence, but closure lacks a legible on‑page cost: the liberator “slips past” guards and succeeds without a priced turn. The final image reconfigures conceptually (fields flourishing), yet the price of secrecy, danger, or loss is not made tangible. Orientation is clear early; causality is linear but soft, with minimal tightening. This reads as outline‑clean rather than scene‑earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the density of images builds until she crystallizes and imprints the sound. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she integrates the sound into the device and accepts an ongoing, evolving task. Cost is muted and mostly pre-existing grief; the ending’s peace (“a sense that she was exactly where she was meant to be”) softens consequence. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure follows an accumulative/textural lens: notice couple → notice jar/message → take photo → take jar → depart. Closure is a soft charged poise—Lumina leaves with the moonbeams, “closer” to destiny—but tangible cost is missing. Orientation is clear (emerald station at moonrise). The mid‑story discovery deepens atmosphere rather than reconfiguring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent accumulative/textural lens culminating in a charged final image with the orb. Closure is a quiet RR (Charged Poise), but the cost is lightly felt rather than undeniable. The progression from crafting to intention forms a gentle shape. No causal breaks, though pressure remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hybrid drive with a light causal spine: find seashell → find cast → decode → realization. Closure arrives as a decisive internal reorientation (conceptual repricing) but the price paid is mostly asserted, not felt. Orientation is clear, scope is contained, and the single scene holds. The decryption functions as the tightening beat, though its process and resistance are largely summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: listening → narrating → deepening hush → charged darkness → reconfigured world → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the shadows’ “new and mysterious pattern” and the world’s reweighted hush). Orientation is solid from the start; the on-page cost is more suggested than legible. The causal thread is lyric but coherent, with one cadence intensification at the last star’s extinguishing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is a conceptual repricing when Zeta reframes thought as emergent from experience. Orientation is clean; the ice violin and courtyard recur to teach the pattern. However, escalation is largely reflective and off‑page; the cost is muted. The final image lands, but the stakes never tighten beyond tranquil contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images recur until the raised lens offers a gentle reweighting. Orientation is solid, and closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when the lens reframes the scene. However, there’s minimal on‑page cost or constraint at the ending; the decisive change feels conceptual rather than pressured. The single scene holds, but escalation is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers ritual and care toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean (who/where/what by early lines). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—marbles polished and returned, the garden “knowing” the dresser—but cost is conceptual and light. No major causal turns, yet the cadence shift at sunset provides a satisfying close.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean causal chain: repair → simulation → touch → sideways transit → return with data. Closure is a conceptual repricing—Kaelin confirms her theory and reframes her purpose—but the cost is light and largely asserted. Orientation is strong early; single‑POV remains stable through one transition. The lens holds, but the final beat lacks a felt price beyond delayed analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (flooded opera house, lanterns, orchestra pit), and the middle beat (tilting the program to manipulate water) functions as the single tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reads the hidden message and leaves changed—but the cost remains soft and mostly affective. The sequence flows, but pressure never truly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned investigation → collaborative margins → conceptual repricing of “truth.” Orientation is clean early (oracle at mountain weather station; fever recently broken), and the closure lands as a reweighted premise with cost. Structure is linear and coherent, if gentle. The price is legible but largely conceptual rather than situationally forced.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single drift deeper, with the radio hush and logbook providing a gentle cadence shift. Closure lands as a small conceptual repricing—finding the logbook’s “weighty truth” and shifting from drowsy alertness to clarity—but lacks a palpable price. Orientation is clean early; causality is simple and intact. The final change is credible yet soft, with minimal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: contemplation → burrowing → earned stasis as guardian. Orientation is clean early; one meaningful tightening occurs as the connection to the surface thins. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, though the cost is soft-focus. The structure is cohesive but lacks a sharper cadence shift to heighten the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds toward the eclipse and a charged poise ending where connection lands. Orientation is clean early, and the closure beat (Eli’s wonder blooming; Aria’s satisfied release) arrives on-page. Cost is light—primarily the acknowledged fragility of beauty and letting Eli go. Structure is coherent but modest in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: detail layers toward a quiet closure as the diaries’ imagery reweights the room. Orientation is clean early, and the throughline (probe, decipher, depart) holds. Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (earned stasis/charged poise) with minimal cost. The chain lacks a tightening turn; the “deeper meaning” of the displaced axis never forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear (lighthouse after closing) and the piece builds a mood through motifs, but the closure (“life will never be the same”) lands as assertion without on‑page cost or a decisive reconfiguration. The dawn parting is a cadence shift, yet the price is absent or abstract. The spy specs and orchestration promise a turn that never concretizes into a consequential action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: whispers intensify, the soundscape crescendos, then settles into charged silence. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration (sound yields to silence; possession averted), but the cost is thinly felt. “Before the possession completes” appears late and doesn’t shape tactics earlier. Causality is fine for a lyric mode, yet escalation remains largely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is apt and held: dawn, symmetry, map, shell, and spire accrue toward a charged final image. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise) rather than a decisive change; the writer “knows” they’ve become the conductor, but cost is faint. Orientation is crisp and the single‑scene scope is clean. The ending’s assertion lacks an undeniable on‑page price, keeping it below high‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterning of light→dark, echoes, and tablet guidance densify toward emergence. Closure claims a Decisive Change (she remakes the world), but there’s no on‑page cost—no foreclosed option or loss at the end; success feels inevitable. Orientation is solid and scene continuity holds. The tablet’s glow guiding her to the labyrinth’s heart is the nearest causal beat, yet pressure never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds via seasons, tools, and hush until a quiet reconfiguration—peace and a “new melody” forming. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the pattern holds. Closure reads as a resonant stasis more than a decisive change, with only a soft cost (world recedes). It lands, but the price is implied rather than sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pigeon → message → contemplation → decoded threat → charged resolve progression is coherent and oriented early. The decoding is summarized (“by progressing laterally”) rather than dramatized, softening causality and cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—she chooses to proceed carefully—with risk implied by being followed and the hidden lab. The lack of an on‑page test limits decisiveness, but the before/after stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: UV lights hum on, pattern density thickens, leading to a quiet reconfiguration as she releases sorrow. Orientation is clean, single scene respected, and closure (earned stasis/charged poise) is on‑page. Cost is mostly emotional and modest but present.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning accrues toward a dawn‑moment realization. Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise) rather than a decisive change, with limited on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early (poet, grotto, starlight) and maintained. The rope’s reprise and the dawn cadence provide a before/after, but the stakes remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere and recurring motifs build to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hush is reweighted by communal art. Orientation is solid early; structure is two shards (approach → gathering) with one clean transition. Closure lands on-page with the hush “tempered” and the bowl pocketed, though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional. The causal thread is light but coherent within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is immediate and stable; the single-scene accumulative design is coherent. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a gentle cadence shift at departure. Closure is a soft Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she finishes, leaves, and keeps the petal—but the cost is mostly conceptual, not felt. No decisive turn narrows options, so the closure lands quietly rather than compellingly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Coherent accumulative/situational flow: locket → meeting → shared values → decision to honor “silent contributors.” Closure lands via their commitment and next‑day action, but the key turns hinge on coincidence and are summarized rather than dramatized. Felt cost is minimal and beats resolve smoothly. Structure is tidy but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly: build → search → tag → creation → presentation → belonging. Closure lands as an internal shift (ache to peace), but the cost is faint and most turns are summary‑smooth. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, though the hunt resolves conveniently. The ending is legible but low‑pressure for top‑tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details accrete toward a quiet RR: she borrows time, perceives the echo‑vortex, and returns changed. Orientation is clean and the sequence is coherent; the “giant’s nap” provides a soft clock. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the city through her art, though the price is light. One awkward line (“being sculpts time itself”) jars but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: moonrise → silence → ritual → realization. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing as she reframes emotion as fluid topography, with her secrecy and “ambiguous loss” shading cost. The beat‑to‑beat causality is coherent if gentle, but pressure never tightens beyond a ceremonial cadence. The final image (eyes watching, stalactite drip) anchors an on‑page end state, though the price is more tonal than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the outage’s flicker → return of light creates a cadence shift and urgency that leads to a charged final tableau. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dweller recommits to being “hidden in plain sight,” leaving evidence to be found. The price (remaining unseen while seeking to be seen) lands, albeit softly. Orientation is clean from the outset and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the trellis/leaf/storm pattern intensifies toward a quiet resolve. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—she reframes her stance and commits to change. However, the cost isn’t concretely paid on the page, and escalation is linear rather than tightened by a turn. Orientation is clean and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain (find brooch → follow rain trails/markings → exchange → revelation → art) coheres and ends in a conceptual repricing as the brooch reweights the island’s meaning. Cost is present but lands earlier (bartering art) rather than at the closing beat; the end image reads earned but low‑pressure. Orientation is clean, but many turns are summarized instead of dramatized, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pilgrim arrives → pearl accepted → deeper attunement → reconfigured purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (she reframes her role) but cost is faint. Orientation is clear and the single scene coheres. Lack of a concrete price at the end keeps the cadence gentle rather than clinching.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: relics → plan → installations → communal recollection → symbolic closure with the valve. Orientation is clean and the closure image is legible, but the decisive turn happens off-page via summary and lacks a felt cost. The healing arc reads inevitable rather than pressured. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, softly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits, but escalation is linear and low‑pressure, with few linkages that narrow options. Closure is a conceptual repricing—she exits “transformed”—yet cost is not made legible on the page. Orientation is clean and single‑shard, but the ending doesn’t crystallize a charged price. Setups (punch, arrows) return but don’t reconfigure stakes causally.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds through transcription beats toward completion and conceptual repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when are legible), and the closure—peace settling as memories “given a voice”—lands, though lightly. Causal turns are scant; progression reads as steady rather than tightening. Cost at the end is implied (endurance, relinquishing doubt) more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Structure is coherent: storm → magnetic weave → crescendo → distortion/duplicate → realization. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of “goodbye” via the echo’s line and the final gateway image. Closure lands but the cost is mostly conceptual; little is foreclosed beyond boredom. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single scene, single POV, clear anchors; the Situational lens is apt (pressure of the director’s reluctance, plan to breach, they wait for the moment). Closure is a Charged Poise: readiness to act, options legible, risk named, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The “reconsideration requires a breach” is a meaningful mid‑scene tightening. The effect lands, but without an on‑page price paid, it stops short of elite closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the dawn hum builds, then fades, and she resumes collecting. Orientation is clear early; scope stays in one window. Closure is a gentle cadence shift (hum fades, pages full, promise of stories) but the cost is faint and mostly conceptual. The sequence reads as a continuous mood study, not a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent, and the final image (label stored, survivor moving on) offers a soft resonance. However, escalation is thin and on‑page cost is not legible at closure. The “task complete” line forecloses without visible price, weakening the RR effect. Structure is linear and clear but low in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the crescendo of hums and whispers coheres to a Charged Poise/CR closure when the “ephemeral compass” clicks. Orientation is clean; single scene, single POV, one stake. The turn is legible, but cost at closure is faint, limiting impact. The sequence escalates smoothly, though it risks “and‑then” rhythm in places.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative lens fits: messages proliferate, unity accrues, the deadline looms. Closure lands as Charged Poise—residents stand ready as privatization nears—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Causality is clean (graffiti → spread → unity), though beats are summarized rather than dramatized. The foundation chip’s reprise at the end provides a coherent closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear and the piece closes with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (she captures the images and restores the grain), but escalation is modest. The warning message tightens time slightly, yet obstacles never meaningfully alter options. Cost at closure is primarily emotional, landing softly but legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single scene, anchored early, with an accumulative/textural drive that culminates in the drone’s steadiness. Closure arrives as an earned stasis/charged poise image—the drone hovering—but on-page cost is faint; coincidence with the ship’s launch adds aura rather than pressure. Causality holds at the scale attempted (adjustments → improved response → final tweak). The lack of a visible price at the end limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves from outpost search to code to lake step with a coherent cadence and a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean, but the causal specificity of “cracking the code” is summarized, muting the turn’s force. The cost is implied rather than pressed. Structure holds, yet escalation feels gentle rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: footsteps and vibration build toward a dawn reweighting where the town faintly responds. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the ritual pattern teaches itself. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise, but the cost is soft and largely inferred (time, stamina), limiting impact. The single‑scene flow is coherent without causal turns beyond intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she succeeds, but the living whispers are lost, reweighting the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what/why), and the piece holds a single scene with one deepening (to the heart/orifice). Causality is simple but coherent; no teleports or unkept setups. The cost is on the page (“whispers fell silent,” “unsettling stillness”).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation is strong early (reef, lighthouse prison, ajar door), and the piece holds a single scene with an accumulative/textural drive. Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise (resolve to continue at the lock), but there’s no on-page cost or decisive reconfiguration. The “before they found the bodies” clock appears late and is not cashed in. The lock’s “waiting” energy promises a turn that never arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: grasping the bead awakens the greenhouse and advances the ghost’s debt repayment. Orientation is clean early, and the because/therefore chain (guidance → bead → awakening → fading) holds. The cost is legible in the ghost’s diminution and the alchemist’s bittersweet realization. The structure is simple but sound.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds to a quiet RR/Charged Poise—tapestry complete at dawn reweights the labyrinth from ruin to promise. The closure lands on the page, but the cost remains mostly conceptual. Orientation is stable and the single‑scene drift is coherent. The plate’s reprise and dawn image give a mild cadence shift that reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: excavation sequences accrete meaning until the closing reconnection. Orientation is clean and the sundial motif threads structure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and the cost at the end is implied more than felt. The middle lacks a pivotal turn that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens fits: atmosphere builds toward the sealing of the envelope as a quiet closure. Orientation is clean from the outset. The closure is a Charged Poise/soft Earned Stasis—the choice of surface mail in a fast era—but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized. Structure is coherent yet thin in causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterning of stitch/flame/star builds to a Charged Poise closure as the chart completes and the coup nears. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence holds. The closure’s cost is mostly conceptual (ominous horizon) rather than felt via a concrete on‑page price. Still, the completion reweights stakes and options enough to register as RR.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation coheres: spirits crescendo → windowpane messages → apparition solidifying → release and fade. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the reflection image and the “weight lifting,” though the cost is soft. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what) and the object setup pays off. A single tightening happens at the clearing; the lens holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative/textural drive is stable: coral/cast/mist motifs layer toward a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration as anesthetic closes in. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the ending’s image coheres with the pattern. Closure lands as a reweighted stance (peace/hope), but the cost is mostly tonal rather than dramatized. The decrypting action produces a shift, though causality remains gentle rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer toward a charged final image where the orchard seems reanimated by the mural. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—the fragment integrated, the film transformed, the place briefly “reborn.” Cost is soft and largely conceptual (leaving the art to the ruins), which tempers impact. Orientation is clean and the single-shard structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; escalation builds via sound/mirror density into a crescendo. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the mural animates as she relinquishes certainty. Orientation is clean early; causality holds (mirrors → feedback → transformation). Cost is implied (certainty crumbling) but underweighted, preventing a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece layers images until a final legacy tableau. However, causality is thin—beats read as ongoing description rather than turns, and the “gourd rattle seed as key” never produces an on‑page change. Closure is a gentle cadence shift (legacy/continuation), but cost is not legible on the page. The scene remains more premise‑expository than event‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the postcard cue → lullaby → quiet afterglow forms a cadence shift to an Earned Stasis/RR. Orientation is clean early (shell, fungi, postcard). Closure lands as a reconfiguration (renewed purpose, sleep), though the cost is mostly historic rather than on‑page. The single‑scene integrity is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the song and ensuing light create a cadence shift that reweights the stake, landing as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is firm from the opening; the scene holds single‑POV coherence. Cost is felt but soft, tied to ongoing duty and solitude rather than a narrowed option set. Closure is present but modest in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: detail density builds toward a resonant reconfiguration when she completes the transcription and reframes the silence. Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid, but the on‑page cost (ink well emptied, implied social risk) is faint. Escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early (single POV in a breathing, volcanic amphitheater), but the piece accrues imagery rather than turns, and the closure (“she knew she had found the key”) is stated rather than enacted with cost. No decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights options beyond affirmation. The chain/message motifs do not culminate in an on‑page decision with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dust‑mote ritual accrues meaning and culminates in a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis at the skylight. Orientation is solid from the outset; pattern remains consistent. Closure lands as a reconfiguration (“ready… heart at peace”) but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt. The scene remains one continuous window with clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs accrete until a quiet RR where “necessary distances” reframes from physical to spiritual. Orientation is adequate early; the terrace and logbook anchor the scene. Closure lands conceptually (finding father, felt peace), but cost is faint and the path’s decoding resolves too smoothly. The midcourse tightening (symbols pointing to a hidden path) is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds mood toward a dawn‑bound shift. Closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (“luminous respite” achieved), but cost is vague—no sentence makes the price undeniable. Orientation is clear early, and the beat sequence is coherent, though largely static. The burnt feather reprise helps continuity but doesn’t enable the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seeds → denser crystals → hidden chamber → symbols → realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (paths vanish due to flux), coherently seeded. Cost is faint—urgency about memory fading never tightens options on the page. Orientation is solid early; one scene, clean progression.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: imagery layers toward a calm cadence, but the ending is more continuation than reconfiguration. There’s no decisive change or earned stasis; applause and reset to “next act” read as status quo. The bishop’s charged reprise suggests potential, not on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear and the piece coheres as one continuous scene; the cadence tightens into the dance and closes on the verse etched on her skin (RR/CR). However, the cost at closure is faint—purpose replaces exile without a visible trade‑off beyond leaving the garden—so the landing is resonant but soft. The internal logic (moonstone omen → dance → verse) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: mist, reflections, ripples accrete toward a mild realization. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and the pattern holds, but the closure is a low‑cost Charged Poise rather than a decisive turn. The final walk‑away confirms role rather than changing options. No persistent constraint meaningfully shapes tactics or cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: walking, opening the box, mirror-gaze, then a reframed mission. Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is muted. Orientation is clean throughout. The sequence is coherent yet plot‑light, with minimal causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene coheres from calm arrangement to vision and back, culminating in a quiet reconfiguration (she returns with clarity). Orientation is firm early (grotto, bench, gauge). Closure lands as Charged Poise rather than a decisive act; cost is faint (momentary overwhelm). The because/therefore is soft, but the pattern density shift around the pulsing gauge gives a workable turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens is evident, with a gentle pattern of discovery (film → diaries → mapping) culminating in a conceptual repricing: the cartographer becomes part of the legacy. However, the beats are summarized rather than dramatized, and the cost at closure is faint. Causality exists but is soft, with “and then” sequencing rather than tightening turns.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern (painting + coded lullaby + bells) coheres to a soft closure as the mirrors respond; orientation is clean from the outset. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is faintly implied rather than felt. The beat sequence is linear and legible, if low in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: a single scene that builds mood toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Orientation is strong and the final image reweights the terrace/clipboard motifs, but the on‑page cost is mostly asserted (“price paid”) rather than shown. Negotiations are summarized, so the closure lacks a decisive turn. The piece lands a gentle RR but with limited causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Hybrid tending Causal at closure. Orientation is clean, and the decisive act—“she released the waters”—lands on the page with a consequent transformation. However, the cost of achieving it (political risk, physical danger, or moral trade‑off) is asserted offstage (“navigate the complex web of interests”) and not felt at the moment of action, muting closure weight. The map‑by‑cracks provides a causal bridge but the resolution arrives too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (courtyard under snow; single POV), and the structure tightens from approach → untangling → prism activation → departure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she leaves reweighted by an internal shift. Cost is gestured (relinquished echoes) but not concretely tested, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the dome’s hush enables a creative turn and a quiet resolve to return. Orientation is clean, and the pattern holds, but closure lacks a visible cost or decisive reconfiguration—more a satisfied pause than an earned stasis. The “first step on a journey” cadence lands, yet without pressure the before/after feels slight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the piece builds a pattern of reverent actions culminating in a charged poise as Aria departs and the structures remain. Orientation is clean (who/where/when set early), and the single-scene window is respected. Closure lands as a resonant image, but the on-page cost is faint and mostly conceptual. The turns are gentle—more deepening than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single scene, single POV, clean orientation, and a cohesive accumulative/textural drive culminating in the plucked-rope hum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a charged final image where the instrument “preserves” the names. The causal chain is thin but intact (study → braid reconfiguration → card insertion → hum). Cost is lightly felt (labor/solitude), which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early, and the piece follows a clean bunker → dream → return arc. The closure is a conceptual repricing—accepting a path that “chose” them—but the on‑page cost is light. The storm/time device tracks but doesn’t meaningfully narrow options. Overall coherence holds under an accumulative/textural lens, though escalation is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere intensifies toward a closure where the covenant is sealed and perspective reconfigured. Orientation is stable and the object recurs to charge the final image. However, cost at closure is light—the surrender of skepticism is declared but not felt through consequence, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    Operates under an accumulative/textural lens: music intensifies, reality bends, and a gentle RR closure lands. Orientation is clean, but causality is soft—abilities (spell, cellular memory) appear without groundwork and resolve the conflict easily. The final cadence is legible, yet cost is faint and consequence largely asserted. The throughline is clear but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern and cadence tighten toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she completes the mirror and exits, reweighting reality/dream boundaries. Orientation is stable and single‑scene coherence holds. The closure has conceptual cost (abandoning the ordinary world) stated in the final vanishing. Escalation is mostly experiential rather than causal, but the closure is legible and earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres and lands a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration when Aria returns and joins the tending. Orientation is clear, single POV holds, and the motifs recur. The decisive change carries minimal on‑page cost and relies on summary causality (visitors arrive, orchard thrives) rather than a pressured beat. The because/therefore chain is soft, with the seeds functioning more as a gentle nudge than a true turn.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: humming → grove → Order → bathroom → stone → breakthrough → book → exit. Closure is a conceptual repricing (knowledge as nonlinear web), but the cost is implied (forbidden knowledge) rather than concretely felt on the page. Orientation is clear and the sequence cohesive, yet escalation is soft and consequence remains abstract. The ending lands, but without a distinct price point.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: atmospheric progression with a causal spine (message → pursuit → diary → renegotiation → library). Closure lands as a reorientation (Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration), but the cost is soft—pursuers dissolve offstage, and no meaningful sacrifice is paid. Major beats are summarized, muting because/therefore tension. Orientation is clear, but the ending’s price remains largely conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as atmosphere and pattern intensify toward the realization that the Garden is as much a state of mind as a place, followed by the cove reveal. Closure lands, but the cost is faint—no decisive tradeoff or foreclosed path beyond effort and unease. Orientation is clean, but the ending resolves too easily for the charged build.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ticking intensifies, shadows shift, the rope’s pattern emerges, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is on the page—Emilia’s understanding and purpose sharpen—yet the legible cost is light. Orientation is clean; the scene holds one window without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual attention to ice patterns and resonance builds toward a hush that lands on the page. Causality is soft but coherent (study → conjure → beings attune → hush blooms). Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration, but cost is under-articulated, dulling impact. The single-scene flow is clear with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece accrues motifs (prism/shard/stars/pavilion) to a closure beat where the orrery sparks. Orientation is clean early; single scene holds. Closure lands, but the cost is soft—no constraint tightened or price paid beyond wonder. The because/therefore chain is minimal; escalation reads as density increase more than plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → descent → contact → reweighting. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she accepts the role—yet the cost on the page is faint. Orientation is strong from the first line; single scene continuity is clean. Lacks a decisive tightening that materially narrows options beyond mood and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: a quiet walk that layers mood until the mosaic note reconfigures stance. Orientation is clean and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (renewed purpose), but cost is faint. Beats are linear and low‑stakes; the scene relies on ambience over turn. The final image coheres, yet lacks a concrete trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: observation → attunement → dawn/clarity. Orientation is crisp from the start, but the closure (the talk resuming, her feeling at peace) lands without a discernible on‑page cost. The jade cicada and starlight recur as pattern rather than causal gears. The final beat reads as a mild Resonant Reconfiguration, not a decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the gilded hush arrives, density of silence imagery builds, and the hour’s return resolves to a resonant reconfiguration (fear less dominant). Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene coheres. Closure cost is modest but legible—the fear persists, reframed rather than erased. The causal chain is minimal by design, but the cadence shift at the hour’s end lands.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Structure is clear (single continuous passage from whistle to sunset), with a soft closure as a Charged Poise/RR (“mission for the day accomplished”) but the cost is faint. Orientation is solid from the first lines. The pattern intensifies atmospherically rather than causally, yet the final reweighting of silence is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly—ruby flake → murals → message → path → staircase → throne—culminating in a Decisive Change (she claims the throne). However, obstacles are frictionless and the key reveals arrive conveniently, softening escalation and price. Closure is on‑page but cost is faint; sunrise urgency never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the arc coheres: fading threshold → reconnection via scars → descent → flame rekindling → choice to reengage. Closure is on-page (revived flame, revitalized threshold, decision), though the cost is implied more than felt. Orientation is steady; sequence reads cleanly. The causality is simple but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is legible: messages prompt experimentation, pressure builds, diamonds result. Orientation is clear and the single‑scene flow holds, but the closure lacks cost—success arrives without a trade‑off or consequence to reweight options. The “submarine bolt holds the key” setup never pays off causally, registering as a soft check‑off. Closure reads more like a celebratory reveal than a decisive turn with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hum → crank → standing waves → visions escalates texturally. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (they depart with “newfound understanding” and a reweighted world), but cost is not legible on the page—no foreclosed path or felt price. Orientation is clear early and lens holds, yet the ending declares stakes rather than staging a charged poise or earned stasis. As a result, closure lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens through the snap→coalescence→merger sequence and closes with a before/after (withdrawn to merged conduit), but cost at closure is soft—mostly bliss without a price. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and pattern is consistent. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the cost proof is faint, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds via repeated images (dust, files, button) toward a Charged Poise where purpose crystallizes. Orientation is clear, but closure registers as a gentle reconfiguration without a concrete cost or narrowed option set on the page. The “emancipation” frame hints at before/after yet doesn’t drive a turn. The ending image coheres but lacks a decisive tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and motifs build to a quiet Charged Poise closure at dawn. Orientation is clean, but escalation is gentle and the cost at closure is largely conceptual (risk, not felt consequence). The map leads to a gathering and dispersal without a decisive turn or reweighting that materially narrows options. Closure lands, but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the music densifies, mist shifts, then returns for a quiet charged poise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the single-scene frame holds. Closure lands as a mood cadence rather than a decisive change, with low on‑page cost; the prophecy’s threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density increases with the speck’s glow and the revealed leaf code, culminating in a quiet reconfiguration (she decodes the prophecy, the glow fades, a new stasis). Orientation is clean, and the throughline holds. The closure’s cost is underarticulated—no sacrifice or constraint is made legible at the end beyond a declared “forever changed.” The turns (“prod” → glow → pattern reveal) connect, but stakes never bite.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: sensory beats gather from cavern to greenhouse to return with the device completed and a conceptual shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—acceptance of uncertainty—yet the cost is soft and mostly verbalized. The build proceeds without complication, so tightening is modest. Orientation is strong and continuous within one window.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent, culminating in a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she reinterprets failure into a new, steady purpose. Orientation is clean and the pattern (coin/kintsugi/rain → rebirth) holds. Cost is conceptual more than felt, with little on‑page consequence beyond mood. The weeks‑to‑months summary compresses turns, blunting a stronger cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean single-scene arc: sound → discovery → confession → release → return to the path. Closure lands with the spirit’s passing and the charged, quiet continuation, but the price is mostly tonal (“weight of her task”) rather than dramatized cost. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds. No orientation debt; causality is simple but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean early; the piece holds a single POV and one scene with a brief transition. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, building toward a conceptual shift; closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the “penance” lifts. However, the climax is summarized (“beginning to understand...”) and the cost is primarily asserted, not dramatized. Causality is coherent but light on concrete tests that would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: market → lens → painting clue → charged resolve. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing—Lena reorients her life’s purpose—yet the cost remains largely implied. Orientation is clear early; the throughline stays single‑POV and consistent. Still, decisive change lacks a concrete price or narrowed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural; orientation is clean and the piece coheres as one scene with a quiet cadence shift when the dust trail yields the hidden compartment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she departs reweighted by the logbook and the humming barrel, with a conceptual “cost” of burdened purpose. The causal thread (dust → compartment → logbook) is simple but intact. Cost feels light, keeping this below higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → release → printing crescendo → charged poise. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—eternity as depth realized in a single moment. Causality is soft but coherent; orientation is steady. Cost is mostly conceptual (destabilizing systems), limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: motif density builds (shard, storm, covered mirrors, time’s shimmer), closing in an RR where she claims a new role. Closure lands with a before/after—she is “reborn” as chronicler—yet the cost is mostly stated sorrow, not pressed by a decisive on‑page beat. Orientation is clear; sceneing is continuous. The shard’s promise provides light causality, but escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: setup, steady intensification, and a closure image (the box’s first note and the chip dimming) that signals a modest cost. Orientation is solid early, and the single-scene structure holds. The decisive turn (alignment and release of the crystalline note) lands cleanly. The cost remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the ceiling lower.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the piece coheres through a steady deepening from tunnel to lagoon to grotto. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (unity with lagoon/compass), but cost is soft and unarticulated on the page, reducing impact. The “deciphering” beat compresses a potential turn into summary, blunting the cadence of the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one continuous scene with a gentle cadence shift when the storm subsides and the sculpture stands complete; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a Decisive Change. However, the cost at closure is minimal—gratitude for GPS failure does not constitute a price paid—so the final reweighting feels mild. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs (etched glass, postcards, moonlight) accrete toward a quiet reconfiguration where Luna adopts a new stance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she accepts a softer voice and “umbral tenderness”—but the cost is soft-focus and largely conceptual. Orientation is clear and the throughline (cathedral visits → understanding) is coherent. The beat‑to‑beat causality is impressionistic rather than decisive, which limits force.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (who/where/what) and the pattern of images is consistent, but closure lands softly: Naomi’s vow to continue lacks a visible on‑page cost, reading as ongoing drift rather than a charged reconfiguration. The parley slightly deepens options (Naomi begins to understand the codes), yet the ending doesn’t tighten or reprice the premise meaningfully. The final image (engines hum, lagoon below) is evocative but not a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive is evident: contemplation builds to a dawn‑shift into action. Closure lands as a cadence change (planning to doing), but cost is minimal and the flourishing town is summarized, softening pressure. Orientation is clear and stable. The amber bottle and lantern motif recur but do not catalyze a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: pressure builds via atmosphere and the idea that archiving births an accidental prophecy. Closure lands as a Charged Poise image (dawn, wax shaving pulsing, scribe gone), but the cost is mostly conceptual; no decisive change is enacted on page. Orientation is clean early, and the pattern holds, yet the ending’s price remains soft. The result is coherent but not fully earned with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual → hum/visions → conceptual commitment. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she accepts lifelong stewardship—with conceptual cost (burden) more asserted than dramatized. Orientation is solid (who/where/when) and the scene maintains coherence. The vortex insight (inheritance as transmission) is the decisive reconfiguration, though its price is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: wind → hush → bell experimentation → clarified tone → vocational reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (quiet final image with a new stance), though the cost remains conceptual more than dramatized. Orientation is clean early; the pattern taught (wind/bell/listening) is paid off. Slight softness in on-page price keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a quiet build toward a charged final image (the glass placed prominently; departure at dawn). Orientation is clean, single scene, single POV. Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is faint and largely conceptual. The beat sequence has minimal cause/pressure; turns feel iterative rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density grows from approach → opening → reading → closure with a charged final image. Closure registers as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the recluse closes the box and accepts the burden. Cost is emotional and conceptual, not tactical, but it does land on the page. Escalation is modest; the “tangled covenant” remains background and never alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is solid early: who/where/what are clear (“emerald silo,” damaged capsule). The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens with a hint of pattern-discovery via the garage-sale code. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration (renewed purpose) but with little cost, and many beats are summarized rather than enacted. The hinted “response/code” moment isn’t dramatized into a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the feather’s arrival and the kite‑string snap build to a quiet repricing where acceptance of transience reweights the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she departs changed, carrying the moment—though the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean from the start. The beat sequence is coherent, if modest in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the pattern of tending, wiring, and recording intensifies toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clear early (caretaker, temple orchard, diagnosis) and the final image reweights the pattern with cost (declining health/time). Structure is largely summary with one meaningful deepening after the prognosis. The closure lands, but turns are soft and mostly recounted.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single scene that intensifies toward a threshold image, but closure (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing) lacks a concrete on‑page price. Orientation is solid and pattern consistent, yet the final reweighting—“the pilgrimage was self‑discovery”—reads as stated insight more than a pressure‑driven turn. Cost is implied, not legibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    Orientation is solid early (coachman on a jetty at twilight, one scene). Accumulative/Textural drive is evident, culminating in a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: seeds sown, a reborn garden promised. Causality is thin—beats accrete rather than tighten—and cost at closure is mostly conceptual. The structure holds, but the decisive change feels low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under a causal lens, the chain holds: orb → riddle → phonograph decoding → trek → spring. Orientation is clean and the ending provides a resonant reconfiguration (purpose and oasis found). Cost is asserted (“long and arduous”) more than dramatized, softening the climax’s weight. The puzzle solution arrives quickly with minimal resistance, slightly flattening the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the observed light and the compass’s glow build a pattern that culminates in her stepping into the unknown (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis-lite). Orientation is clear and the throughline holds. The closure lands, but the on-page cost is modest and largely conceptual. The beat sequence is linear and simple but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the mission proceeds to an on‑page completion (the pieces are swapped; the sky steadies), so closure occurs. However, cost is not legible at the end—no price paid, foreclosed option, or persistent constraint shaping the final image. The sequence reads “and‑then” with a single gentle tightening at the board rather than pressure‑linked beats.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the walking-words and chessboard motifs build to a quiet Charged Poise. Orientation is clean; one continuous scene. Closure arrives via a reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but costs and narrowed options remain vague, keeping it short of stronger structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → vision → seeding → reconfigured space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (bookstore becomes threshold) but the cost is conceptual and faint. Orientation is clean and the scene is continuous. A sharper, legible price at the end would raise the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is coherent: decoding → labyrinth entry → reflective traversal → release. Closure lands as a decisive inner shift (forgiveness) with a clear before/after image (frozen village stirring), though the cost is mostly inferred. Orientation is solid from the outset. The turns are summarized rather than dramatized, softening felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds (mist, echoes, spire), breaks pattern at crescendo, and reweights via the spire’s reveal. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: “price of forgiveness…to be understood,” followed by readiness for the ritual. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible in the renunciation of simple defiance. Orientation is clear early (aerie, canyon, ritual horizon) and the single tightening (“spire seemed to be drawing closer”) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: she completes the pattern match and surfaces, a Decisive Change in knowledge with physical cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds via recurring images (acid sea, charm, kintsugi) tightening toward the final gasp. However, logistics blur—extended reflection “between breaths” strains plausibility and the underwater/workbench setup is fuzzy. Despite that, pressure and payoff cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dock → wrong turn oasis → return to paint → legacy reflection. Closure arrives with completing the oasis painting and a conceptual “temporary eternity,” but on‑page cost is light. Causality is intact (wrong turn → revelation → painting), if gentle. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard rhythm is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the piece coheres as a single dawn ritual that swells to a sonic/olfactory crescendo. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he accepts a role “vibrating in harmony”—but the cost is soft; no path is foreclosed beyond prior solitude. The vial cork reprises at the end, yet consequences remain conceptual rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: at dawn on the empty plain, she accepts irretrievability and faces a new horizon. Orientation is clean; the build accrues via recurring motifs (station, censer, moon, calls), but key pressures are summarized rather than staged, softening the felt cost. Still, the final image clearly “after-weights” the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discoveries accrete (eye → messages → cache → cures) toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear and single‑POV holds. Closure lands as a resolve to proceed, but the cost is conceptual rather than concretely tested. The relic thread hints at deeper stakes without a decisive on‑page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single, misted scene accruing pressure through motif rather than discrete turns. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Kael claims the boutonnière and resolves to investigate, reweighting the lighthouse’s “borrowed memories.” Cost is implied (the burden/isolation), but it’s soft, and causality remains light. Orientation is clean; the structure is steady but conservative.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    There is a causal spine—chip → ants → cavern → doorway → father’s note → chamber—ending in a legible reconfiguration. But coincidence drives early turns (mysterious customer; ants as guides), and the puzzle/trials are summarized rather than dramatized. The closure lands, though cost is minimal and the rising creek never forces a concrete, irreversible trade‑off. Structure reads as an “and‑then” sequence more than pressured escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.9)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but closure is summarized not dramatized: “There, she found a truth…” with no on‑page cost or reconfiguration. The causal spine is a simple approach sequence without a felt turn; the “final warning” does not alter options. The ending lacks a Decisive Change, Charged Poise, or Conceptual Repricing with legible price. Orientation is clear, but closure fails the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attention deepens from observation to a quiet realization (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean; one continuous scene. The whispered phrase is the closest thing to a turn, but consequences remain soft. Closure lands as revaluation rather than change with cost, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: writing deepens into immersion and a reflective reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is clean (cabin, scroll, woods) and the throughline is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is soft and largely asserted, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean and the accumulative/textural lens holds, culminating in a quiet RR/CR as she reframes her work post‑loss. However, the closure’s cost is faint and the pattern barely tightens beyond reiterated insights. The final act—placing the screw back and leaving with renewed resolve—lands, but without a meaningful narrowing of options. Overall coherence is steady but light on structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a resonant reconfiguration: held breath → whispers → writing → sunset/quill spent. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a gentle price (expenditure of the quill, release of past weight). The causal thread is thin but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (archive, task, Astra), and the piece sustains a single scene that densifies into the humming/glow and then a release. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the message is sent and her stance shifts to hope, with the orchard’s looming loss shading the cost. The causality is gentle and largely declarative; obstacles are minimal, but the texture coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear, but the closure relies on asserted resolution (“distortions cleared,” “universe restored”) without an on‑page price or decisive turn. The pattern intensifies toward hush and unity, yet the cost proof is missing at the ending beat. Structure is coherent but the decisive change feels told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece layers image and routine until a quiet cadence shift at dawn. Closure is a soft Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—renewed vigilance—without an on‑page cost beyond ongoing solitude and duty. Orientation is early and clean; causality is minimal but consistent with the chosen mode. The absence of a meaningful pressure point or consequence limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs build toward a realization. Orientation is clean and the piece maintains a single scene. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing—she reframes self/world boundaries—but cost is minimal and largely asserted. The convergence (mushrooms, strangers, button) is gestural rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: library → subway reflections → charged return to the lantern culminating in resolve. Orientation is clear and the single POV holds; the closure is a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a felt but modest cost. The because/therefore chain is soft; developments are insight-led rather than event-driven. Still, the ending reweights the premise adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a patterned loop builds to a quiet Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation is crisp from the outset; structure is coherent. Closure lands conceptually (continuing the loop with purpose), but the cost is faint and largely asserted. Lack of a tightening turn keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits, but escalation is thin and closure lacks a decisive cost. The late “years later” summary diffuses any on‑page cadence and reads like epilogue rather than earned reweighting. Orientation is clean; causality is mostly “and then” mood accrual. Final beat is a gentle Charged Poise at best, without a meaningful before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the rumor spread and communal activation build toward a resonant reconfiguration: Raven’s loneliness lifts as the station transforms. Orientation is clean and the scene holds as one continuous window. Closure lands, but the cost is soft and largely asserted; no meaningful constraint tests tactics at the end. The moon rock setup leads to a conceptual repricing (community, not magic), which works but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound/scent patterns builds to a cadence shift at the stillpoint. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—ring pulsing blue, tattoos shimmering, and a broadened understanding. Cost remains soft and mostly conceptual, slightly muting the ending’s force. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean and the sequence (consider → unbend → ink → write) coheres, but escalation is minimal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: reframing weeds as necessary and assuming stewardship of editing history. The cost is thin—responsibility is named but not dramatized through a charged test. Accumulative/textural lens fits better than causal, yet the final cadence lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the crowd gathers, the signing becomes conducting, and the harbor is “retuned,” culminating in a charged final dawn image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world is “tuned” and the advisor departs. Cost is more thematic than dramatized, which softens the cadence’s bite. Orientation is clean and the single scene stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is coherent: a patterned making leads to a hidden message and a final charged image. Orientation is clean from the start; the archive and goal are legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) but the “truth” is summarized, not shown, softening the cost. The chain of “and then” creation beats lacks a decisive tightening beyond the reveal of the alcove.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sound and light density builds (drumming → lagoon response → vortex/vision) toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the single scene holds. Closure cost is the acceptance of fleeting connection (“moment… fleeting,” dimmed glow) and the decision to persist. The causal thread is light but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs (storm, maps, coin, key, whispers) accrue to a quiet closure where the whisper “wins.” Orientation is clear, and the scene flows linearly. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than decisive change, with minimal on‑page cost. Setups (coin, key) don’t pay off causally, softening structural tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterning, reflection, and silence accrete toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Closure lands as a soft RR: tension dissipates, the mirror is abandoned, and the two part, but the cost is faint and largely conceptual. Orientation is clear early (dock after rain, guardian, figure). The beat progression is linear but thin on consequence, so the before/after line is delicate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from library to grotto to town‑wide displays and lands on a resonant transformation. Orientation is clean; causality is soft but coherent. Closure arrives as a conceptual reweighting (people pausing), yet cost is minimal and largely unvoiced. The arc functions but never tightens into a decisive on‑page turn with price.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure gathers through motif (whale call, scrimshaw, sea) to a resonant reconfiguration where the “disappearing island” is redefined. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. Closure arrives on the page (return with unlocked heart), though the cost remains conceptual (no concrete loss beyond renunciation). The throughline is steady if low‑conflict, with one meaningful deepening at the plunge.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: motifs (turbines, whittling, bouquet, narration) layer toward a charged hush and a glimmer of hope. Orientation is clean, single POV holds, and the ending image functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn. The cost—endurance within loss—is implied more than felt, limiting impact. Structure is coherent but light on a focal tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds toward a Charged Poise/RR in the final image of the colonnade as heartbeat. Orientation is clean and the scene holds as one continuous window. Closure lands conceptually (a reweighted world where art remakes perception), but cost is faint and largely asserted. The ban setup does not return to press options, softening the decisive feel.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural but closure lacks cost: the courtyard “becomes a hub” via summary rather than an on-page decisive change. Beats list forward without a tightening turn or a constraint that reconfigures options. The final image reprises motifs (concertina, plants) but doesn’t reprice the premise with consequence. Orientation is clear; the problem is low structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is evident: atmosphere and motifs accrue toward a soft crescendo. Closure reads as a quiet cadence (momentary satisfaction and readiness to continue), but lacks on‑page cost. The meta line “to meet the word count, we will stop here” undercuts the earned resonance. Orientation is clear; causality is secondary but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres from ritual action → star alignment → curtain illumination → quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is strong early; the causal mantra (origami → alignment → glow) makes sense. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the final image of peace and renewed purpose, though the cost is muted and phrased declaratively. The brooch and curtains reprise cleanly but without a decisive narrowing or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: rain-to-dawn cadence culminates in a quiet recommitment (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is clean; single POV, continuous scene. Closure is present but the cost is soft—solitude and ongoing labor rather than a foreclosed path. The structure repeats motifs without a decisive tightening beyond time passing and a tonal deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: archive → object → vision → altered aftermath, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean and the progression is coherent, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized. The “avoid patterns” constraint is introduced yet not enacted in a way that creates tactical beats. Closure lands, though gently.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → pattern recognition → conceptual naming of the shadow → charged resolve. Orientation is clear early (blooming library above clouds, stone, footage), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise. Cost is present as “luminous regret” and the weight of task, but it’s soft and not sharply dramatized. Still, the ending image reweights the premise coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (mist, stars, tail, shedding) build toward a Charged Poise/RR closure where she recommits with a reframed purpose. Orientation is clear early; single POV and scene are stable. The closure’s cost is mostly conceptual (renouncing dogma), not dramatized in a specific trade-off. Lack of concrete external test keeps the change modest.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the piece coheres as a descent culminating in a Charged Poise/RR: breaking through into the chamber and feeling “closure.” However, cost at the ending is soft (fatigue, ache) and the decisive reconfiguration is more experiential than consequential. The causal line is serviceable but lacks a tightening turn that meaningfully changes options.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to a conceptual repricing—goodbye letters reframe as enduring love absorbed by the gazer. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern (object → trance → re‑entry) is legible. Closure lands quietly with a reweighted final image; cost is implied (taking on the “unused love”) but not strongly dramatized. The causal chain is light but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: an intensifying aurora and ritual attention build to a dawn reconfiguration. Orientation is solid from the opening; single scene coherence holds. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose), but the on‑page cost is soft. A clearer price or constraint at the end would strengthen the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Works under an accumulative/textural lens: images and energies intensify toward Asa’s partial merging and a dawn reprise that reweights time and renewal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes one with the dune, then separates with the task advanced. Cost is subtle (temporary loss/blur of self), not sharply taxed in a single beat. Orientation is solid from the start; causality is impressionistic but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—he returns with a reweighted view of the rainforest as gateway—yet the cost is faint (“roar… that threatened to consume him,” but no tangible loss). Orientation is clean; the pattern (hum/wind → translocation → perspective shift) holds. The cadence tightens slightly near the end, but the cost proof remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds a pattern of misted procession → vigil → threshold. Closure is a Charged Poise at the dawn shore with a conceptual cost (commitment signaled by the glowing star stamp) but little on-page sacrifice. Causality is coherent but largely “and then” rather than pressured turns. The single tightening (the vigil) mildly reweights resolve rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds quiet pressure through patterned stillness, the mundane bolt-turn, and the recurring discoloration path, landing in an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is solid early; the causal line is intentionally soft but coherent. Cost is present conceptually (renunciation of voice reframed as strength) though lightly felt on the page. The single-scene containment supports closure but never tightens into a decisive on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds a pattern of annotations leading to the on‑page unmasking. Closure lands (pretender revealed; Kael departs), but the decisive beat is summarized and low‑cost. The setup is coherent and pays off, just without a tightening that strains options. No orientation debt; causality holds but feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs (beeps, waves, tapping) build to a conceptual repricing where the “truth” shifts from data to rhythm. Orientation is clean from the outset; the station and atlas anchor time/place. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise with the reprise of drumming and the ocean’s “whisper.” Cost is implied (accepting mystery) but not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres in two shards—spaceport to stone circle—building toward a charged poise where resolve returns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (a reweighted future through the glasses), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean early; causality is simple but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence coheres (arrive → decode kite → retrieve orb → unseal) and closure lands on the page, but the cost at closure is soft—the “implanted destiny” reads as uplift without sacrifice or narrowing of options. Still, there’s an on‑page cadence shift at the unsealing and a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the environment’s cadence shifts from whipping wind to lull, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as she adopts a durable stillness. Closure is on-page (photograph smoothing, resolve stated), though the cost is largely conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through a hard tradeoff. Orientation is clear early, and scope fits a single continuous scene. The structure is coherent but lacks a meaningful narrowing of options beyond atmospheric easing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens as untangling becomes ritual, leading to a resonant reconfiguration that reweights darkness as a beginning. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse library, broken tarot box). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a charged final stance and image, though concrete cost is muted. The throughline from fragments to flow is coherent and continuous.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—patterns, ink, and time dilation build to a quiet RR/CR at the precipice. Orientation is clean and the single-scene progression is coherent. Closure is a conceptual repricing (a reweighting toward understanding patterns/time), but cost is soft and largely asserted. The encounter resolves smoothly with minimal narrowing of options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cause and effect are coherent: locate pod → read letter → grasp implications → disseminate → watch the fallout. Closure is a decisive shift in role (archivist to revolutionary) with a conceptual cost, though personal risk remains largely offstage. The single scene holds together without orientation debt. The turn is credible but a touch expository, with key obstacles summarized rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: tending, teaching plants, welcoming refugees, and a final quiet affirmation. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—she has left the sworded path—but the cost remains mostly conceptual. Orientation is solid early; pattern is consistent. Lack of a meaningful tightening keeps the structure from landing harder.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density and cadence build as the garden “responds,” culminating in the echo. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (communion achieved; constellations settle), but cost is soft and mostly externalized to the garden’s “spent” state. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The throughline is coherent, though the lack of a felt price dampens the final weight.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: a reflective single scene culminating in resolve. Orientation is clean, but closure is a Charged Poise without on‑page cost; the scandal remains offstage and untested. The because/therefore chain is light, mostly a build of imagery → resolution. The plan to use proof by contradiction lands as intention, not a decisive change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration via the tether and meteor hush. The causal line is soft but legible: time fold/whispers → tether → stabilization → reframing of guilt. Cost is primarily internal and understated; the resolution borders on easy once the metaphor is decoded. Orientation is clean and the single-scene frame holds.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the whispers intensify, the mist encroaches, density rises toward a final mandala change and hush resolving to lilac light. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a priced endurance (she keeps unease, revalued). Causality is gentle but coherent—tile → “listen deeply” → pattern reading → final interjection. Cost is present but understated, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the sequence (find tessera → memory → naming act) coheres and closes in a conceptual repricing of the plaza. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds. The closure—renaming with a declaration—lands on the page, though cost is low and largely conceptual. Tightening is modest but present via the vision prompting the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs thicken to a calm reconfiguration as she “repairs” the timeline and attains peace. Orientation is solid early (garden at twilight; Echo; coin), and the single scene holds. Closure is stated rather than embodied—“she had succeeded”—and the felt cost is faint. The pattern holds but lands more as declaration than necessary on‑page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern build from meditation to kinetic light painting to a dawn image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the recall reframed as catalyst, the painting as proof. Cost is implied (risk, psychic exposure, exhaustion) rather than concretely tested, keeping the ending quiet. Orientation is clear early (studio, geode, recall), and the single scene coherence is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece stacks sensory-emotional mapping toward a glowing finale. Orientation is solid, but the closure reads as a gentle resonance rather than a DC/RR/CR with cost. The “colder air/darkness presses in” never meaningfully tightens options or alters tactics. The final cadence declares readiness rather than reconfiguring stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the canyon echo, buttons, and hourglasses accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing where prophecy becomes possibility. Orientation is clean from the outset. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“warehouse…a beacon of shared wisdom”), but the cost is faintly implied rather than made undeniable on the page. The middle lacks a decisive tightening; causality is more associative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mist, snow‑codes, and path accrete toward a resonant reconfiguration: embracing the other self. Orientation is clean and the throughline (seek unused courage → follow path → meet self) coheres. Closure lands, but the price of that reconciliation is implied rather than dramatized, lowering impact. The snow‑code device is under‑specified, softening causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a quiet crossing whose cadence shifts when the traveler arrives and the fog thins. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—calm arrival on the far shore with a conceptual “distillation”—but the cost is faint (mostly time and waiting). Orientation is clear early and the single scene holds. The final image reweights prior motifs, yet the before/after lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and sensations accrete toward a quiet realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes the oasis as kindness made durable and chooses to carry the glass—but the on‑page cost is faint. Orientation is clean from the start; no lens ambiguity. The scene lacks a decisive tightening beyond a deepened thrum and the smoke’s flattening, so the cadence shift is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images accrete toward a dawn‑closure (RR) where renewed purpose is affirmed. Orientation is clear early (harbor, fire escape, rosebush) and the scene holds unity. Closure lands softly; cost is implied (letting go of bloom, accepting cycles) rather than sharply felt. No causal missteps, but the decisive turn is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (hum, sundial, brittle awakenings) accrue toward a quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset; causality is secondary by design. Closure lands as a soft RR—an acceptance to coexist—though the on‑page cost is faint, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images accrue (temple, pond, nest, artists) to a Conceptual Repricing—connection is made, not found. Orientation is clear early; single scene holds. Closure lands, but the cost is soft (no concrete foreclosed path beyond solitary seeking). Beats link by adjacency rather than causal narrowing, which limits force.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence (tune → detect pattern → counter‑signal → disturbances fade) is clear, but the closure lacks an on‑page cost and resolves immediately, failing the cost‑proof test. The “cosmic tricksters” remain offstage, so opposition never becomes concrete. Orientation is solid; the structure is a single clean scene with a tidy, low‑friction win.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—organ, darkness, and artifacts build toward a cadence shift at the crystal. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing and mild Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra reframes the “key,” fear recedes, and she leaves changed with a wistful cost. Orientation is crisp early; the scene holds coherently. Cost is modest (leaving the nexus; the loss of fear’s protective caution), tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds a hush of images toward a resonant reconfiguration—understanding the quest is self‑understanding. Orientation is clean and the closure lands, but the price paid is soft and mostly conceptual. The ribbon and mist return in the final image to mark the shift, though causality remains thin. One continuous scene holds coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.9)
    Single‑POV and orientation are clear, but the accumulative drive doesn’t culminate in a decisive Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing with cost. The final line promises a future revelation rather than reconfiguring stakes now. Escalation reads as repetition of mood and intent, leaving closure underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images accrue (glass flake, scaffold pattern, amnesty) toward a reflective closure. Orientation is clean; structure is a single reflective scene with a soft turn when the breeze reveals a pattern and the music follows. Closure is a modest reconfiguration (resolve to speak), but cost is faint and mostly declared. No decisive narrowing of options or on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a quiet walk-through accrues markers toward a reflective closure. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (peace reframed; decision to tell others). Cost is implied more than felt, but the closure unit lands. Structure is linear and coherent with one scene and a firm cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds toward dawn and a conceptual repricing about shared burdens. Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she reframes her task and feels the weight lift—yet the cost is faint and largely asserted. Orientation is clean; single scene holds. Lack of a concrete, pressurized turn limits payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Structure is linear and legible: approach vortex → find frozen figure → touch → mirror cracks → realization. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (what mirrors don’t show = the soul), but the cost is mostly asserted (“shook the druid to their core”) rather than dramatized. Causal connective tissue is competent, if basic; the past figure and mirror appear in time to pivot meaning. The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens with a mild cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean; the scene coheres and culminates in a CR/Charged Poise realization (the covenant as blueprint), but the cost at closure is faint. Beats accrete imagery more than narrow options, producing a soft cadence shift rather than a decisive turn. The closure lands conceptually, not causally, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the outset (catacomb orchard, single POV, present task), and the build from discovery to spell to departure is coherent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: a reweighted final image of leaving with the card and a changed orchard; the “barter” lands conceptually. The cost is soft—no clear forfeit or constraint persists beyond mood—so the ending’s weight is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: memories, the phone call, and the scrap build toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure arrives as a stance shift (resolve to reclaim thrill), but the price remains largely conceptual. Orientation is clean throughout. Lack of a concrete escalatory beat limits structural tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits, but closure lacks cost: mist clears, seed brightens, and “balance” is claimed without a price or foreclosed option. The decisive change is stated, not dramatized, yielding a soft reset feel. Orientation is fine, but the ending’s reconfiguration doesn’t bear an on‑page consequence. The beats read largely as summary escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clear; the piece coheres as a lyric meditation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—continuing to “preserve wonder in routine.” However, the ending’s cost is faint and largely asserted, with no decisive turn or constraint tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres around the pearl/shell listening and culminates in a conceptual repricing as she emerges carrying the “radiance.” Orientation is clean (who/where/what) within the first lines. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration, but the on‑page cost is light and the tightening is modest. The scene maintains single POV and one continuous window with a legible cadence shift at the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs build to a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise as she resumes walking with lighter guilt. Orientation is clean; the scene coheres. Closure lands softly but the cost is faintly felt rather than undeniable (the medication choice’s price doesn’t press the ending beat). The structure holds but lacks a marked tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coherently accretes images and methods (watch, whispers, cipher) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the library is a state of being. Orientation is clean from the start; the final doorway and return provide a legible cadence shift. Cost is subtle rather than undeniable, tempering the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Charged Poise as she resolves to step into the unknown before her promise “loses its glow.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). The causal chain is light, but the cadence tightens around the “act before it’s too late” beat. Cost is felt rather than dramatized, keeping the closure modest but present.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear anchors (Aria in a sky grotto working an emerald) arrive early; the piece holds an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the infusion, the threshold recedes, and readiness replaces urge. Cost is present but muted, residing in the foregone crossing and the pang of sorrow. Structure is one continuous scene with a clean cadence shift at the glow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece proceeds in a single tranquil register toward a realization that the hairpin symbolizes the cycle of rebirth. Orientation is clear and the pattern stays consistent, but there’s minimal tightening and no felt price at closure. The closure is a conceptual repricing rather than a decisive change. The result lands softly without consequence reshaping options.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the patterning of chimes/shard builds to a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration where certainty is tempered. Closure lands conceptually but with modest on‑page cost and little tightening of options. Beats proceed by summary (“they listened,” “they unraveled”) rather than pressured causality. Orientation is fine; the ending image reweights meaning but without a concrete price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits; the lesson accrues via ripples and hush toward the student’s understanding. Closure is a quiet realization, but no felt cost or decisive tradeoff is on the page. Sequence is coherent and anchored, yet the beat progression is linear telling (“she explained,” “she guided”) without a tightening turn. The final clarity lands, lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attention → appraisal → pattern recognition → synchronization of the wandering pulse. Orientation is clean from the start (canyon, bone towers, skimmer, arrowhead) and the motif pattern is taught early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pulse synchronizes, transforming the frame of stillness into earned navigation. Cost is legible conceptually as centuries of dust and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discovery → touch → unstrap → radiant response → repriced outlook. Closure is a conceptual repricing (renewed sense of purpose), but the on‑page cost is faint; no concrete foreclosed path or consequence is felt beyond awe. Orientation is clean and the sequence coherent. The causal thread is thin but intact for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: atmosphere and image density mount toward a conceptual repricing at the window. Orientation is clean early; the throughline (seek the text, follow the glow) holds. Closure lands as a realization that reweights his world, but the cost is faint, mostly the off‑page forfeiture of festivities and the risk of being “lost” in the stacks. One meaningful tightening occurs (getting lost then drawn to the glow), though stakes remain primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural build from coins → distillation → ingestion yields a legible closure image. Orientation is clear and the pattern is taught early. The closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration but with a soft cost—fulfillment is asserted rather than tested. Causal links exist, but pressure is gentle and largely unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from atlas to voices to crystallized monsters, then breaks as forms dissipate. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—peace gained at cost of lingering melancholy and acceptance of the eternal task. Orientation is clean early, and the sequence coheres as one scene. The decisive change is soft but legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual’s cadence builds to the bell’s toll, giving a clean closure image. Orientation is strong and the single scene holds. However, the cost at closure is largely conceptual; nothing concrete is foreclosed or lost. The “new era” line lands more as declaration than earned reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits, with a quiet Charged Poise ending, but closure cost is faint. Orientation is solid, yet the “trail of photographs” never produces a decisive change or reconfiguration beyond reiterated intention. The final image (“promise of stories yet to be told”) reprises motifs rather than tightening options. Closure lands conceptually, not decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence coheres—finding the crystal → flame activation → mist → starling patterns → deciphered “code” → quiet closure—but the closure cost is soft. The ending lands as Charged Poise (“on the verge,” crystal stored) without a felt loss or foreclosed path. Orientation is clean and single‑scene, but the decisive change remains a mood/insight rather than charged reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the night’s work gathering into a dawn‑side “new understanding” provides a quiet resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the start; single scene and POV hold. Closure lands as pride plus renewed burden, with modest on‑page cost (fatigue, ongoing vigilance). The decisive shift is conceptual rather than event‑driven, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV, single-setting flow is clear; orientation is quick and stable. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration as Kaito reframes identity and the jar fades in salience. Cost is soft—no concrete trade-off beyond letting go—so the closure lands conceptually more than viscerally. The clone battle and history flux function as pressure atmosphere rather than causal machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clean (nocturnal brook, cottage, dawn), and the piece holds a single scene with a two‑shard feel (night to morning). Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the seed shifts from mystery to catalyst. Cost is light (fatigue), and the tightening is modest (decision to outline the plant‑themed room). The throughline is coherent, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the performance densifies from roar to hush to laughter, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with a gentle cost (exhaustion; bittersweet stasis). Orientation is clear despite a clunky, duplicated hourglass line. The single-scene arc stays coherent without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: mist → reverie → whispers → repriced pendant → calm vigil. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance and a reweighted pendant) but the cost is soft. Orientation is clean early and the pattern is taught and kept. Absence of a concrete turning point or test keeps it out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and charge rise toward the crescendo and the on‑page reconfiguration of the crozier. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing of authority into rebirth. Cost is underarticulated on the page—more declared than dramatized—tempering impact. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: tuning → hidden chamber → message → reweighted understanding. Orientation is clean and the pattern intensifies toward lunar perigee. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the shard as the city’s echo), but the on‑page cost is faint. The sequence lacks a meaningful constraint or consequence that would deepen the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Charged Poise as she crosses the threshold. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and the grotto discovery plus radio check‑ins accrue toward the final step. The decisive cost at the end is implied rather than concretely priced on the page, softening the closure’s weight. Still, the pattern builds coherently to a threshold image that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterns and sensory density build to a vortex and a return to the entrance for a circular closure. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—she exits with the thread as a lifeline—but the cost is soft (altered memories/dependence implied rather than felt). Orientation is solid from the start. The arc tightens once (final pattern), yet consequences remain largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds, moving from city twilight to a charged hopeful tableau. Closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (the city reframed as a launchpad), but cost is abstract and not felt on the page. Orientation is clear and single‑POV stable. The piece summarizes rather than staging turns, yielding a soft cadence rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: mist, pulses, and hush accrue until the cadence shift where the mist clears as closure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the hearing‑aid motif coherently threads to the final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—peace achieved and Aria recommits—though the cost is modest and largely conceptual. The scene holds a single arc with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/goal), and the causal chain holds: find codex → tide turns → return via cables. Closure lands with her surfacing and keeping the codex, but the cost is thin and largely asserted. The logbook/phase‑transition discovery is functional but resolves quickly without on‑page complications. The lens reads primarily causal with light accumulative texture in the “crashing hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: snow, ink, radio static clearing, and the ghost’s coalescence build toward a conceptual repricing. Closure arrives in a resonant reconfiguration—accepting wisdom from failure rather than extracting truth—capped by the shard’s release. Orientation is steady and the single scene coheres. The cost is present but understated, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curse refigured into a blessing and a “new language” born amid a crescendo of echoes. Orientation is clean early; pattern and cadence tighten toward the end. Cost is weakly felt—urgency and loss are posited (“death of a language”) but the scene does not dramatize a tangible price at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from receiving the arrowhead to the phone’s static intensifying and the voices coalescing into a narrative. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (emergence with “frostbitten hope” and renewed resolve). The causal cost is thin, with little on‑page foreclosing of options beyond internal recommitment. Orientation is solid early (who/where/what), and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: the music’s spread builds to a resonance that reconfigures the orchard (RR). Orientation is clear early (orchard, statues, sky‑bridge), and the cause‑effect of music → stirring → rebirth tracks. However, the cost at closure is light, and pressure never tightens beyond a single soft swell. The structure lands a quiet cadence shift but lacks a charged price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean single-POV progression with a causal throughline: find package → plan → border timing → handoff → return. Closure lands (delivery completed) but the cost is mostly conceptual; no true on-page consequence tests the risk. The drive lens reads Hybrid tending Causal, held without contradiction. The decisive moment—slipping past the drone—tightens briefly but resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues motifs (mist, wind bells, halo fragment) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—silence reweighted from emptiness to possibility—and the return-to-work beat carries the closure. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the two‑shard walk to the oasis reads cleanly. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional and modest, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density and urgency build as lamps fade and the scarf shimmers, culminating in the stories’ “gentle hum.” Closure arrives with the reawakening, but the cost is soft (time, solitude) and not distinctly priced. Orientation is strong: who/where/when are clear early. The single scene holds together, yet the ending’s Charged Poise lacks a sharper before/after cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Structure coheres (dock → making → library review) with one POV and a subdued cadence shift at the end (“continued pursuit”). Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—Elian accepts ongoing longing—but the on-page cost is faint, more asserted than felt. Orientation is clean; the main shortfall is that the closure’s reweighting doesn’t tighten stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres and closes when the lock yields and the idea unfurls. Orientation is clean from the outset and the sequence is single‑scene. Closure lands, but the cost is light and largely conceptual (“a piece of themselves”), so the final reweighting is modest. Causality is simple and intact without a meaningful price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: she searches, finds the ring, contemplates the stars, and crystallizes resolve. Orientation is clear early and the throughline (quest/object/patterns) is coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise—a committed vow to pursue stolen memories—though the cost is soft and conceptual. The structure is a single scene with one meaningful deepening (object found) leading to a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through intensifying annotation and pattern discovery, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (first step toward reversing exile). Orientation is clean early; the scene remains single-window and focused. Closure lands, but the cost is faint and mostly atmospheric rather than decisively priced. The causal thread is steady if quiet, with a clear before/after in confidence and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs build to a charged farewell under the “radiant hush.” Closure registers as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise at the threshold), but the cost is diffuse—no specific price is legible. Scene anchoring is clear early, yet the middle simply amplifies wonder without a decisive tightening. The waterfall-as-gateway reframes the setting, but options do not narrow in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The unraveling yields a steady intensification—whispers swell into a “living entity” of silence—and culminates as spirits dissipate: a clear cadence shift and on‑page closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). Cost is present but soft: the dense hush that follows and her lingering unrest. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the pattern remains coherent through the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: observation → pattern recognition → reverent repricing. Closure is a quiet RR/CR—she reframes the henge and herself—but cost is soft and largely asserted (“protecting herself from potential revelations”) rather than felt in a concrete trade‑off. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece deepens through linked images and artifacts toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is prompt and clean (sunken library, Eli, purpose). Closure lands as the “last transmission” reconfigures from external mystery to an interior whisper, with cost registered in the melancholy and renunciation. The tightening is modest but coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the piece tightens from tranquil attention to storm‑charged creation; closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (mural complete; ghost’s breeze response; she departs changed). The because/therefore is soft, but the density and cadence shift are legible. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, muting the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (elevator, spire, diary) and the ending yields a Resonant Reconfiguration—the spire repriced from prison to sanctuary, with the diary as catalyst. However, the felt cost is soft and largely conceptual; pressure never truly tightens. The single‑scene flow is coherent and closure lands, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres and closes with a Charged Poise: Lyra’s stargazing crystallizes “spooled wholeness.” Orientation is solid early (sky gondola, storm aftermath), and motifs knit to a quiet cadence shift from turbulence to peace. Cost is mostly conceptual—bearing legacy, reweighting loss—so the close lands softly rather than decisively. Still, the pattern holds and the ending reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients quickly (who/where/when) and coheres as one scene under a ticking demolition clock. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the portrait’s glow and the artist’s departure with the coin reweight the premise with the cost of imminent loss. Causal threads are present but soft (coin → brushstrokes → final image), with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds as a single accumulative scene: discovery → code → map → charged readiness at sunrise. Causality is gentle but coherent (noticing the luminance after turning the phrasebook page, then decoding the hopscotch patterns, then charting). Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Eli is ready to set course, with secrecy and spent night as price. The cost is felt but small, keeping this shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: study → pattern → door → mirrors creates a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the world reweighted as clockwork harmony and belonging. Cost is light (no real sacrifice beyond effort and cold), tempering impact. Orientation is clean and consistent within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds from chalk messages to planet‑wide pathways, landing in a resonant reconfiguration but with minimal on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and causal links are intact, though much is summarized rather than dramatized. The closure (energy network realized and reweighting of community/planet) lands, but pressure and trade‑offs are soft. No decisive turn challenges options beyond deciphering messages.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: dusk deepens, work completes, lullaby releases a charged stasis. Orientation is clean (hidden lighthouse, lantern room, single POV) and closure lands with the hush “becoming a living, breathing thing.” Cost is mostly conceptual—weight of responsibility—rather than dramatized loss. The ending reconfigures atmosphere more than options, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: nut triggers memory → blueprint → impressions → activation before frost. Orientation is solid and the single‑POV throughline holds. Closure occurs on the page with the labyrinth reactivated and travelers saved, but the cost is light and the nut’s trigger feels convenient. Stakes resolve neatly without a hard narrowing beyond the time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observations of foam/chrysalis accrue toward a closing reconfiguration (purpose replacing grief’s grip). Orientation is clean and the single-scene flow is coherent. Closure lands but the cost is soft—no decisive foreclosing act, just a gentle repricing. The research insight and grief resolution are parallel rather than causally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres around a single pressure line (curiosity vs. preservation) and lands with a quiet RR/CR as Ember reframes where stories “begin.” Orientation is clear early; cadence thickens around “quantifying absence,” yielding a felt turn. Cost is implied in the foregone incising—present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean and the accumulative structure progresses logically from kitchen to dunes to pavilion to return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she endures the flood and emerges with a calmer burden. The cost is asserted (“threatened to overwhelm”) more than dramatized, softening impact. Still, the throughline holds and the ending is legible under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean, but escalation is largely atmospheric, and the closure (“efforts had borne fruit”) is asserted rather than earned with on‑page cost. The final dawn shift reads as cadence more than decisive change. Cost is not legibly paid in the ending image, undercutting closure strength.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: observation → modification → access to memories → charged final role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she becomes “archeologist of abandoned dreams”), but the on-page cost is minimal. Orientation is clean, and the single-scene flow holds. The escalation feels gradual rather than tightened by a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid drive: causal backbone (doodle → map → grotto → tomes → insight) layered with textural phenomena (threshold effects, mist). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the inversion-hour constraint is coherent. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—she reframes the “seeds” as tangible with a duty—though the on‑page price is soft. The constraint of time supplies structure but the decisive turn carries little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single scene where density of images (stress cracks, strings, insulator) builds toward a cadence shift: silence remains but is no longer oppressive. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration on the page (“The silence was still there, but…”), though the cost is more implied patience and labor than dramatized sacrifice. Orientation is clean; causal joins are soft but adequate for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens is consistent, and closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: he recommits to a path. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when all clear). Cost at closure is faint—no opposing force, only a declared vow—so the before/after is modest. Structure stays single-scene and coherent but lacks a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single scene culminating in a quiet Charged Poise before the fireworks. Orientation is strong and the beats flow (attune → clasp releases → reading → resonant hush). Closure lands as a reweighted state of attention rather than a decisive change, with cost only faintly implied. Because cost is soft and pressure light, the closure feels graceful but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds toward the bloom and a conceptual repricing of “wisdom.” Closure exists in the seed’s opening and her reweighted understanding, but there’s little on‑page cost to certify the before/after. Structure is clear and linear, with a brief time jump epilogue that doesn’t disrupt coherence. The decisive moment (fragrance release) functions, but the stakes never pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a closure of Conceptual Repricing—Lyra reinterprets resilience as the echoes’ work. The scene is coherent and anchored; the escalation is a density increase (growth amplifies; trail leads to the pool). Closure lands conceptually but with a soft price—she leaves when gravity normalizes without a felt loss, so the end lacks bite. Causality holds and there’s one meaningful deepening, but the cost is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: a single scene accrues detail toward a Charged Poise ending (clarity/determination). Orientation is clean and the survey frames the beats. Closure lands softly with minimal cost; the reconfiguration is conceptual rather than decisional. The causality is stable but the final price remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: detail thickens toward the chisel-strike, then cadence shifts into afterglow. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the hush is “unfettered”—but the cost is soft, mostly conceptual. Orientation is clear and the single-scene arc coheres. The turn is clean but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the density rises from silence to otherworldly vibration to a charged quiet. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the final image reweights her quest with a felt inner shift, though cost is subtle. Orientation is strong early (who/where/goal clear), and the scene holds coherently. Lack of a sharper price at the end limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues via the vanishing stars and culminates in a Charged Poise—Echo’s clarity at the last star’s disappearance. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when are clear). Closure lands, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, and the tightening is singular. The causal thread (insert fragment → print → reweighted meaning) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece holds a single scene with clear anchors and a soft RR closure: the charged eye-contact moment and the pendant’s echo reconfigure her sense of belonging. Yet cost is faint—no path is foreclosed, and options don’t meaningfully narrow. The beat sequence accumulates tone more than causality, landing a quiet cadence without a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/textural build is evident, culminating in mist clearing and a realization, but closure lacks legible cost, reading as a mood shift rather than a decisive reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, yet the scene remains static with minimal causal turn. The ending offers a conceptual repricing (“unity” and “truth”) without a lived price. Structure stays coherent but thin in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs (thread, bead, puzzle, bamboo) accrue toward a Charged Poise ending where she sets out. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is maintained. Closure lands, but the cost remains conceptual; escalation and causality are soft, relying on lyric reiteration rather than a decisive on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: craft process → completed sword → apprentice arrival as a cadence shift. Closure is a gentle Charged Poise—solitude foregone for mentorship and deeper inquiry—but the price is only lightly implied. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. The causal chain within the scene is thin; pressure doesn’t meaningfully force the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean, and the piece builds toward a Conceptual Repricing when clarity “washes over her.” However, escalation is mostly stated rather than dramatized, and cost is light; the shard’s glow/blur → revelation sequence functions but feels preordained. Closure lands, but with minimal price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrue from lantern room to cairn to sea glass reprise, culminating in a Charged Poise resolve. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands as a quiet stance crystallization but with limited on‑page cost. The anonymous letters setup doesn’t cash out structurally, slightly thinning the pressure lattice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/textural build is consistent: ascent, ritual adjustments, dawn’s emergence, descent. Closure lands as a quiet cadence shift (charged poise) when the day is shaped and responsibility is accepted, but cost is light. Causality is intact yet the middle lacks a decisive tightening. Pattern is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: observation → manipulation of light → conceptual realization. The scene is coherent, anchored, and culminates in a reweighting (people as refractors), but the closure’s cost is soft and mostly asserted. No decisive turn beyond the sun’s descent; the reconfiguration lands, though quietly. The donor heart and caution motif set stakes but do not materially tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the sextant is whole and sorrow eases. Orientation is clear early (stormlit tower, observatory, sextant). The mapping action escalates toward the pin‑drop beat, delivering a cadence shift, but the cost at closure is soft, more benediction than price. Structure holds as one continuous scene with a clean descent coda.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: sensation and song intensify to a hopeful cadence shift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise toward ongoing effort) but the cost is minimal and largely asserted. Orientation is solid; the sequence (approach, hum, vision, return) coheres. The ending tilts stakes toward hope without a decisive change that narrows options or extracts price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV, one-night arc is clear, with a gentle accumulative lens: searching → finding the book → message-induced repricing → writing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and soft earned stasis, but the cost is faint. Causality is minimal (the message conveniently arrives), and escalation relies on time markers rather than tightened stakes. Still, the pattern holds and the ending cadence is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: details repeat and deepen toward a gentle repricing where the bread becomes a “key.” Orientation is clear and scope contained, but the closure’s cost is soft, with no concrete foreclosed path. The seasonal montage supplies cadence but little tightening. Quiet resonance lands, not decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pattern discovery via “sampling frequencies” builds to a conceptual reweighting (the vows are living, shaping the present). Orientation is crisp from the start, and the closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. However, the cost is mostly conceptual; no concrete price narrows options or forecloses a path on the page. The single-scene flow is coherent with one gentle tightening around the pattern reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lens: Situational dominant with accumulative texture; pressure is the crowd and dawn clock. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise/RR at sunrise (“fragile sense of understanding”), but the cost is indistinct and the declared mission’s success is told, not earned on the page. Orientation is clean; one continuous scene with a soft cadence shift. Escalation links are more sequential than causal; “capture the sound of trust breaking” never becomes a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: sensation density builds to the stranger’s touch and aurora fade. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes skepticism into seeking with a felt, if quiet, before/after. However, cost is soft and causal pressure is minimal; events flow by mood more than consequence. Orientation is clean and the pattern taught early pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through sensory attunement to the cave as she works, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (creating reweights the lock and her state). Orientation is clean; single scene coherence holds. The transformed lock lands as closure image, but the cost is soft and the magical beat feels convenient rather than pressured. One meaningful tightening occurs (choosing to draw), yet escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean; the map → tunnels → repository sequence coheres and lands in a quiet RR/CR (repricing of truth/candor). Cost at closure is mostly conceptual; the scene avoids a concrete price beyond fatigue/decay atmosphere. The piece reads more as narrated progression than pressured causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and assertions build toward an era shift with a Charged Poise–like finish. However, closure lacks on‑page cost, and escalation is more declared than dramatized. Orientation is clear from the outset. The “new paradigm” arrives without a decisive turn precipitated by action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The controlled burn provides a coherent frame and a recognizable before/after: Aria contains flames and lands in a reweighted stasis. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration (she can carry her fears with less weight), though the practical mechanics and cost of containment are under‑specified. Orientation is clean; escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: incidents accrete (mailbox → residents’ snippets → meeting) toward a thematic repricing. Orientation is clear and the throughline coherent, but most turns are told rather than dramatized. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the locket and note) with minimal on‑page cost. The mystery resolves cleanly and conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (who, where, dominant stake), and closure lands with her encoded final message and literal exit (a modest Decisive Change). The because/therefore chain is thin; the spider‑web “clock” and dice patterning deepen cadence rather than tighten options. Cost is implied (time, isolation) but not sharply priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs accrue (gravity pockets, whale, coffee grounds) toward the touch-and-recovery beat. Orientation is clean and the single-POV progression is linear enough. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (memories recovered; lanterns reweighted), but the cost is soft—no trade‑off or foreclosed path is evident. The “because/therefore” links are light, leaning on mood rather than necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: ritual deepens, night thickens, and dawn arrives with a reweighted final image (wing set adrift). Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is “hushed,” the haven rebalanced. Cost is implied (energy poured, endurance) but not concretely dramatized. Orientation is strong early (nocturnal haven by a brook) and held.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the scene holds as a single shard with backstory folded in. Closure is a conceptual repricing (the student’s changed seeing; the seal’s charged reprise), but the cost is soft and largely asserted. The interrogation and gift are turns, yet neither tightens options in a way that stings.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the whispers intensify toward dawn, culminating in a resolve to integrate memory; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (Lyra, garden, twilight to dawn), and the object’s throughline is stable. However, escalation is linear and low-friction; the decision to archive precedes a largely summarized unlocking rather than a felt turn. Cost at closure is implied more than made legible in a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single‑scene, accumulative/lyric build is coherent and anchored early (who/where/when are clear). Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: she completes the treasonous rewriting and reframes “unfinished” into peace. Cost remains soft and mostly symbolic (a pricked finger, implied moral risk). The lens holds, but escalation and tangible price are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is coherent; the song’s intensification culminates at dawn in a Charged Poise closure where Aria “has taken a step closer” and chooses to continue. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The cost is more atmospheric than concrete, resting on melancholy and ongoing quest. The progression feels like deepening texture rather than causal turns, but the cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: touch → vision deepens → pattern → “windows of connection” open, yielding a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation (Aria, shrine in glacier) is established early and maintained. Closure lands as a charged poise—she exits with purpose—though the cost is only lightly implied (weight of the mission), keeping it out of higher bands. No major causality slips, but the escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images accrue from parapet to clearing. Orientation is clean, but closure lacks on‑page cost—the realization lands without a before/after price. The structure is a single drift with one transition and no decisive tightening beyond arriving at the clearing. The ending functions as a soft RR/CR but feels consequence‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: shredded paper → reassembled letters → revelation of the heart‑site → arrival at the stillpoint. The closure is a Charged Poise image (pulsating glow) that reweights reality, but the cost is mostly conceptual, with minimal on‑page price. Orientation is solid from the outset. The orchestration of the liquidation reframes stakes but reads as told rather than earned through a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: a summary arc from storm to “new dawn.” Closure lands as a conceptual completion (“her work…had helped to bring about a brighter future”), but there’s little on‑page cost or decisive narrowing. The because/therefore chain is generic (“she listened → learned of prophet → guided”) without a pressured turn. Orientation is clear early; the main deficit is low-stakes causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: sensory motifs layer toward a cadence shift where he begins to write. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he reframes isolation as custodianship—but the cost is implied rather than enacted. Orientation is clean and scope controlled in a single continuous scene. A slightly expository middle (“It was this realization…”) blunts the turn’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single scene accruing sonic and environmental detail toward a quiet alignment. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the artifact harmonizes and she commits to vigilance. Cost is soft (fatigue, ongoing watch) and not strongly legible on the page, which dampens impact. Orientation is clear early; structure holds but lacks a decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the moon/viaduct hum intensifies toward a charged poise where the revolution “begins.” Orientation is solid and the scene is continuous. Closure lands as a ceremonial ignition, but the cost and concrete consequences are only declared, not felt on the page, softening the turn’s weight. Causality between tracking and activation stays mystical, acceptable for the lens but not deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the piece lands a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration at the exit. Causality is light, but the lantern/graffiti/water pattern accrues toward a before/after. The cost is implied (exposure, shedding an old skin) rather than felt sharply on the page, limiting impact. Single scene cohesion holds without structural slips.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the shop’s atmosphere and recurring clockwork heart image accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing (“turn apologies into action”). Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherent. Closure arrives via gift + reframed mission, but the cost is soft and largely retrospective. The “second opinion” premise catalyzes reflection rather than a concrete on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned images build toward the bell’s ringing as a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clear early and maintained. Closure occurs on the page, but the cost at the end is light and largely asserted. The middle amasses motifs rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the recurrence of 4‑1‑5‑9 and the archive ambience build toward a conceptual repricing: the files weren’t deleted but archived, and Lena’s stance shifts. Closure is present but the decisive moment is reported rather than dramatized with on‑page cost. The structure reads like a synopsis with few causal tightenings. Orientation is fine; escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: orchard → lighthouse mirrors → reconstitution → charged poise return. Orientation is clear early and the throughline (restore crystal to restore balance/understanding) holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the glowing crystal and a landscape “holding its breath,” though the cost is soft. The pattern is coherent, but low pressure limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image and cadence accrue from desolation to a fragile stasis. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with the final acceptance—“fragile peace… it was enough”—and the carried “sound of approaching endings.” Cost is legible as ongoing fragility and renunciation of the prior surrender. Structure is coherent and single-POV clear without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a reflective walk builds toward a quiet realization that reweights the premise (Charged Poise/CR). Orientation is clear, and motifs recur cleanly (letter, pavilion, wind, vines). However, closure lacks a palpable cost; the final stance feels affirmed rather than paid for. The scene reads more continuous than shaped by a decisive narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single‑scene, accumulative/textural build is coherent, and orientation is clear from the outset. The core sequence (arrival → consecration → listening → sanctuary settled) holds a soft cadence shift. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a sanctuary exists and a vow to tend it is made. Cost is faint, so the ending lacks decisive reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits, but the closing cadence (sunset to night; decision to return) lacks a felt cost or decisive reconfiguration. Orientation is strong; single scene coherence holds. The final image gestures toward Earned Stasis/Charged Poise but doesn’t foreclose an option or reprice the premise. As a result, closure reads pleasant rather than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, one scene with a clean transition outside; causality is coherent: footsteps → summons → decision to testify. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: leaving isolation to risk unraveling research. Cost is on the page (exposing fragile patterns), though still mostly conceptual. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via repeated motifs (fog, chalk, driftwood, statue) to a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean early (prophet in fog sculpture garden with a goal). Closure lands when she discards the chalk and accepts a nonliteral “location,” with the fog erasing her path as price. The cost is present but subtle; still, the cadence shift is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs (clock hand, leaf, tremors) accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing when the hand stops and meaning shifts. Orientation is clear early, and there’s one tightening when tremors test his restructuring. Closure lands, but cost is light and mostly implied (labor, lingering ache) rather than decisively priced on the page. The because/therefore chains are modest; the piece relies on pattern and cadence more than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory motifs and musical method build to a quiet closure where Emma lets go and Lena’s aim is fulfilled. Orientation is clear early (haven, role, patient, blood work as trigger). Closure lands on the page with a felt cost (Emma’s passing) though the causal chain is soft. One scene, one stake, one meaningful tightening after the blood work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds; orientation is clean and the pattern of research → realization is legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the key as universal order; shadows briefly “pause”). Cost is faint and mostly prospective, limiting impact. The piece leans on summary over on-page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: a reflective scene that crescendos to a symbolic resolve. Orientation is clean (Emilia, hedge maze, secret garden) and the tooth recurs to frame closure. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration—newfound purpose—but the cost is faint and no option is truly foreclosed. The “substitute body” thread is gestured at without structural consequence, leaving causal pressure thin.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one continuous scene with a lucid frame, and closure arrives as a charged poise—the sea glass becoming an emblem of the “pearl of stillness.” However, the cost at closure is light; the dedication is asserted but not tested by a real constraint. The cadence does tighten toward the final radiance, but without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a quiet scene accrues images toward a resonant repricing (pendant shifting from pain to strength). Orientation is clear, and the closure arrives in the final walk into sunlight with the pendant’s reinterpreted meaning. The cost is implied (choosing vulnerability and leaving the haven) but lightly felt. Structure is coherent with one meaningful deepening (the proffered flower).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a resonant reconfiguration: she resumes writing and reweights the shell and mist. Orientation is stable; single‑scene coherence holds. Closure lands, but the cost is soft—encouragement dissolves resistance without a felt penalty. The apparition’s return neatly affirms success, muting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). The piece functions under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterning of song, light, and vine builds to a communal chorus. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the arbor becomes “a sacred space”—but the cost is soft and largely asserted. The because/therefore chain is thin; pressure does not meaningfully narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density builds from preparation to enchantment to sealing, with the hum and glow as cadence intensifiers. Closure lands on the page: she succeeds and the plate pulses with a map, with a felt cost (“channel her own life force,” ensuing exhaustion). Orientation is clean early (Aria; orchard in a subarctic crater; twilight), and the single-scene window stays coherent. Stakes stay narrow and resolve without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: study → attunement → reactivation. Orientation is clear early, and the closure image (device ticking) lands. Yet the closure carries little on‑page cost and the “harvest of echoes” remains conceptual, not structurally determinative. The months‑long passage compresses major work into summary, dulling causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a single continuous scene accrues to a quiet closure as dawn arrives and the tapestry stands complete (a resonant reconfiguration). Orientation is clean throughout. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, so the ending lands more as serene cadence than decisive change. The causal throughline (arrive → weave → understand → depart) is intact but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rain, kettle, wood, and repetition build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—carving completed, kettle empty, a contained grief. Orientation is crisp from the outset. The cost is legible as endurance: peace arrives without the pain disappearing. Escalation is gentle but coherent; one tightening beat comes via the kettle‑clock and empty pot at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held to closure; the ending lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with the shutter click. Orientation (who/where/why) is clear and stable, and the carousel halt frames the time logic. Cost is present but soft—more conceptual than dramatized. The sequence from collecting → sunset → click provides a coherent cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV and scene are coherent, and the accumulative/textural drive holds. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (terminal reborn → hope reframed), but the cost is soft or absent. The maze/sextant setups don’t causally tighten options; turns read as declarations (“she realized she could reroute the pipes”) rather than earned beats. The ending image is clear but not transformed by a decisive on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of hush → bear encounter → sunrise culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (clock tower, morning, gardens), and the single-scene flow holds. Closure lands in Elian’s renewed stance, though cost is soft and external stakes remain low. The throughline is coherent with one meaningful deepening but no sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: atmosphere builds toward a resonant reconfiguration when she uncovers the sundial and reframes her pursuit. Closure lands as a quiet internal repricing, but the cost is faint. Orientation is clean; structure is one continuous scene with a soft cadence shift at the end. Escalation remains shallow, relying on lyric density rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: she studies, decodes, and exits into fog, with a quiet cadence shift at “the last knot was decoded.” Orientation is strong, and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands as a soft Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid, but concrete cost is faint, leaving the before/after line mild. No decisive narrowing of options occurs beyond atmosphere deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the silence/dusk pattern intensifies, writing becomes the middle turn, and the thread’s snap closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early; single scene, single POV, one dominant stake. The cost—letting go, accepting absence—is implied but not deeply priced. Closure lands on the page via the final image but with modest consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: imagery and tension build to the device’s crescendo and the world’s partial rebirth (Charged Poise/CR). Orientation is strong early, and the single scene coheres. The closure lands, but the on‑page cost remains soft—no sacrifice or irreversible loss beyond fear/tears. The beat chain is clean but low on concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: lagoon vigil → call → tree graft → reflective close. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits to tending scars—yet the cost is soft and mostly declarative. Orientation is clear; the because/therefore chain is thin but coherent. The final cadence is tidy rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Orientation is immediate, and beats link cleanly: breadcrumbs → shards → door → box → release. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural with a gentle cadence shift at the opening of the box and fountains’ stir. Closure lands on the page, though the cost is light and largely conceptual. No glaring causality breaks or lens wobble, but the path feels unresisted.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a lyric drift culminates in the fading sonar and a legacy image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (gentle sharing over fire) but the cost is soft and mostly asserted. Orientation is clear early (nebula garden, single POV). Structure is linear and coherent, though turns are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: work → mentor → ribbon/poem → butterflies → repriced understanding. Orientation is clean early, single scene coherence maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a felt shift (“she had finally discovered the shape of collective grief”), though cost is gentle. Tightening is present via density increase rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: present‑tense witnessing → discovery → recommitment → forward motion. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she steps onto a path of redemption—but the on‑page cost is light and largely asserted. Orientation is clear, single POV, one continuous scene; a modest cadence shift lands with the sunset image. The rake inscriptions function as the structural hinge, though escalation is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: steady detailing in the silo accrues until the crystal and decoded tapestry reweight the premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—world now thrums with echoes and purpose reframes tending the graves. Cost is soft (time, immersion, renunciation of ordinary reality) and not sharply dramatized, limiting impact. Orientation is strong early; single scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: imagery intensifies toward a poised ending. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—pen hovering before the page—yet the cost is thinly felt and largely asserted. Orientation is clean, and the constraint (obsidian spire) is present but not tested against a consequential choice. Without a concrete narrowing of options, the ending lacks decisive reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tuning → melody → flicker/presence → crescendo → cessation forms a clean density build. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she captures the broadcast’s essence; the alcove becomes a portal and a charged poise endures. Cost is implied (solitude/obsessive vigilance) rather than concretely paid, keeping it shy of higher bands. Orientation is solid early, with a single scene cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene builds from observation to conversation to the act of dispersal, closing on a conceptual repricing of “safety.” Closure lands via the ash‑scattering and the final reframe (impermanence) with a light, conceptual cost. Orientation is clean and the pattern is consistent, but turns are soft and the cost is primarily thematic rather than dramatized. No major causal missteps, just limited tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a reflective single-POV scene coheres toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending (the wry smile and commitment). Orientation is clear early; causality functions through motif returns (cog, ruins, narratives). Closure lands, but the on-page cost remains light and the tightening is minimal. The piece reads more as a resolved stance than a change.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene lyric structure is coherent, with orientation established early and held. The closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to her work after playing, charged by the rosette’s reprise. The cost remains conceptual (patience over time, the weight “across the span of unlearning hatred”) rather than tested in-scene, so the cadence shift is modest. The accumulative/textural lens holds, but the final turn is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the celestial alignment ratchets mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the sprout and meal. Orientation is crisp early; the scene holds. Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft—no meaningful foreclosed path beyond a reaffirmation of purpose. The middle lacks a decisive tightening beyond the alignment’s crest.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clear causal chain: riddle → ascent → inspection → hidden log → reinterpretation of “failure.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the beehive’s “malfunction” is adaptation), but the cost is light and largely intellectual. Orientation is solid from the opening. The lens is Causal through to the end and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: sensory density builds from bay to shop to ritual to expanded perception. Orientation is clean and the throughline is coherent, but the closure’s cost is light (a realization without a meaningful price). The final reconfiguration (“the house as living entity”) lands conceptually, not decisively. One tightening (twilight to night, increased attunement) suffices but lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative lens: the ampoule triggers a perception shift, culminating in a repriced understanding of the garden and the statue’s role. Orientation is clear early and the pattern holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, but cost is soft and the path relies on summary rather than dramatized beats. The “therefore” chain is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds motifs (stairs/dice/chance) toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands conceptually (choosing contented bondage to the climb) with a modest felt cost. However, causal tightening is minimal, and “rupture” is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the closure’s impact. The pattern holds, but without a decisive mid‑scene shift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight → roused purpose → brush‑work → dawn cadence shift. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she commits to ongoing work with a sanctuary carved against smog. The cost is underplayed (fatigue, isolation implied rather than dramatized), softening the before/after. Orientation is clean and the scene stays within one continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the thaw accrues meaning and culminates in a symbolic resolve (opera glass reprise), yielding a soft Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear; causal linkage is secondary to pattern. The cost remains conceptual rather than felt, limiting closure force despite a coherent cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens: Causal—he finds the stone, seeks the yoyo, reverse‑engineers it, triggers the radiance. Orientation is strong early, and the beats link cleanly, culminating in an on‑page glow and stated change. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration but the price is soft; “never be the same” lacks a concrete cost image. Escalation is present but linear and low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single‑POV accumulative structure holds: movement deeper → mirror → blackout → aftermath. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the narrator exits changed, paying an ongoing cost (haunted echo). Some causal links feel soft (dream dictionary’s mechanics and “resuscitation” mention are under-motivated), but the thread remains legible. The cost is present yet conceptual rather than decisively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound layers as blue hour deepens and then resolves to silence with a Charged Poise image. Orientation is clean, and the throughline (interpreting clouds → dubbing → echo) is coherent. Closure’s cost is soft—an echo and exertion rather than a meaningful foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Situational with an accumulative texture. Orientation is clean, and the causal chain (decipher → crack → map/note → choice to leave) holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she exits the city under the watchers’ gaze, with the price (leaving safety) felt but not materially tested. Strong, though the cost is light and the gate “rusted shut” functions more as lore than an active clock.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves from entry to discovery to reconstruction to a light‑bathed finish. Causality is simple and largely unopposed; the hidden letter appears and yields truth without a turn that exacts a price. Closure lands as a serene completion, but cost is absent on the page. Orientation is clean, scope contained, yet the decisive change feels consequence‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds atmosphere toward a quiet Charged Poise. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early and maintained. Closure arrives in the image of leaving the inkwell and the drawbridge’s shadow, but the cost and turn are modest. The method of note-placing is promised more than enacted, softening the ending’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece layers atmosphere and deciphering until a cadence shift at the end (new purpose, ascent with stamp). Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is soft, making the change credible yet low‑impact. The because/therefore links are minimal, relying on mood and motif rather than hard causality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (lanterns, basilica, cranes) accrete toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure arrives in the crane’s release and the recommitment to work, with a felt but subtle cost. The cost is emotional rather than action-driven, yet legible in the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal spine is coherent: trauma → refuge → data analysis → conceptual revelation/purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (unused potential as catalyst) and a charged poise toward a quest. Still, the “circuit breakers cooling” window doesn’t tighten tactics or force choice, and pressure is often summarized rather than dramatized. Cost at the ending is mostly implied past loss rather than a fresh on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the beats connect (scan signal → carvings as map → hidden chip → partial activation), but escalation is gentle and the closure’s cost is thin. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: belonging reframed from signal to lived connection, yet without a concrete on‑page price. Structure is coherent within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive is steady: terrace → shore → charged return with a “Charged Poise” closure. Orientation is solid and the watch hand motif ties the beats. The closure lands as a stance crystallization (she proceeds despite guilt), though the price is muted and mostly conceptual. No causality breaks, but the meaningful turn is subtle rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: moon-phased cadence and misted setting accrue toward a quiet resolution. Closure lands but with low on-page cost—the exchange’s breakthrough is largely summarized rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the final image is coherent. The decisive change reads more declarative than earned in action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds a pattern (compass → poles → paddling) toward a quiet reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—he accepts ongoing regret and continues forward. Cost is implied (regrets remain) but not strongly tested on page. Orientation is clear early; structure is linear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear, and the scene coheres as a single, mood‑driven progression to a Charged Poise ending (path revealed; she commits to go). Closure lands softly without a tangible on‑page price; the reconfiguration is more vow than consequence. Minimal causal tightening beyond the path appearing and her choice to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual layers beasts, spices, chant, and moonlight toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clean from the outset; cause/effect is simple but coherent. Closure lands with Lyra’s expansion and Aria’s connection, though cost remains somewhat abstract. The sequence lacks a decisive obstacle or narrowing, but the cadence shift at climax reads.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: cards → saucer → hand‑tracings → conceptual repricing (“lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost of relinquishment and acceptance. Orientation is clean and props are tracked. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the final image coherently reweights the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres as Aurora stitches toward a cadence shift where the dimension opens—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (recycled spaceship, storage bay, single POV), and the recurring object and act pattern her progress. The cost at closure is soft—her presence “seemed to fade”—but legible enough to qualify. Escalation is modest yet consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.6)
    The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a conceptual repricing (understanding the hush as a guiding force). Orientation is clean, and the old woman’s entrance provides a single tightening. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR image (she will follow the hush), but cost is soft. Causality is mostly “she feels guided → approaches rock → receives bottle,” with few stakes-based constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single‑scene causal chain is coherent: blackout → coded sundial → decision → activation → illumination/revolution. Closure arrives on page with the cradle’s activation and reweighted fort, but cost is largely asserted rather than dramatized. The global drive lens reads Causal and holds. Key turns occur smoothly, verging on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the rock‑sequence builds to a vision that reconfigures meaning (RR/CR), giving a legible before/after (“weight of unfulfilled prophecies… lifted”). Orientation is crisp (herder on tidal bluff under aurora). Cost is mostly conceptual, with minimal felt sacrifice, keeping the ceiling moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm → urge → talisman → envelope → reading → repriced calm. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her vigil ends with understanding—on the page. Cost is implied (confronting hidden truths), though not sharply dramatized. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is linear and oriented early; the duel serves as the central event with a clear outcome. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing (“true victory lay not in winning”). Closure lands, but the cost is faint and the decisive beats are summarized rather than earned through on‑page turns. Sundial mechanics appear, yet causality between coded angles and victory is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the poet commits and begins rebuilding; dawn reframes hope. However, the cost is lightly implied and obstacles never test the resolution on the page. Structure is coherent with a single scene glide, but beats often summarize rather than tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images accrue until the portal into the film world and the return create a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when she renounces the refuge and re-enters the arbor lighter, with a new melody and chosen direction. The cost (“she knew that she couldn’t stay here”) is on the page and functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clear early; the lens holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the monsoon clock provides a soft structure and the ending offers a resonant image (sapling thriving; Aria vanishes). Closure lands, but cost is faint; the memories are declared safe and doubt dissolves without a turning event. Beats mostly summarize process rather than dramatize escalation. Orientation is clean and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: find compass → ritual weaving → release → quieter aftermath. Closure lands on the page via Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with the release into the sea and the lingering “cerulean regret.” Causality is soft but coherent; the grandmother’s method motivates the ritual. No orientation debt; scope fits one dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the greenhouse is re-contextualized. However, the structure is entirely static, consisting of a single, inert observation followed by a prolonged, undramatized reflection. While the closure is thematically coherent, the near total absence of plot or meaningful progression of events makes the piece feel more like a vignette or prose poem than a complete story.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and a series of observations that lead to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, a newfound sense of purpose, is legible on the page. However, the associated cost is nebulous; the "scorched testament" is a past event, and the shift in purpose reads as a pure gain without a tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story's structure is elegant and effective for its length. The single, continuous scene builds atmospheric and emotional density towards a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The protagonist enters with "frazzled nerves" and leaves with strength, a legible change with the chill of the outside world representing the felt cost. Causality is light, but appropriate for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and achieves a resonant closure (Earned Stasis). However, its structure is a significant weakness for this word count; it functions as a compressed summary spanning weeks and then years ("He spent weeks preparing... Finally, the day arrived... Years passed..."). This "and then" sequencing completely flattens tension, replacing dramatized scenes with a narrative outline, which undermines the potential for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood of resilient hope. It successfully establishes a Charged Poise or Earned Stasis closure, where Akira's resolve is reaffirmed. However, the cost of this endurance—the hardship of the sanctions—is a static background condition rather than a price freshly paid or acutely felt in the final moments, softening the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, which is a valid structure. However, the arrival of the "pilgrim of sparks" functions as a convenient catalyst, telling Aria the solution rather than forcing her to discover it through causal struggle. Closure is present and on-page, but its mechanism feels too frictionless to be fully satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalating the intensity of a single metaphysical event. It successfully establishes a continuous scene and delivers a Conceptual Repricing at the end, where Elian's craft is re-contextualized. However, the closure is significantly weakened by the absence of a legible cost; the journey is "terrifying" but results in a net gain of cosmic knowledge without any trade-off, which softens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a simple and-then causal structure, but the central conflict's resolution is a critical failure of causality. The liberator slips past heavy guards through an un-dramatized assertion of skill ("using their knowledge of the city's hidden pathways"). This convenience deflates all tension. The extensive summary at the end replaces an on-page closure beat, telling the reader the long-term results rather than landing a resonant final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmospheric and emotional density toward a clear point of closure. The final act—imprinting the sound and finding peace—serves as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The emotional cost of dredging up past trauma to fuel the creation is legible, making the structure sound and the ending earned within its mode.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing, where Lumina commits to a new, mysterious path. However, the inciting incident—the discovery of the coded message—feels highly coincidental, weakening the causal chain. The structure works for a mood piece, but the plot progression depends on an unexplained and convenient magical breadcrumb rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is fine, but the closure lacks a deeply felt cost. The decision to "abandon the familiar" is stated as daunting, but the final emotion is one of pure purpose, which undercuts the price of that choice and weakens the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and functional Causal lens: discovery leads to action, which leads to a realization and a final choice. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's stance changes, which is legible on the page. However, the cost of this change is merely articulated ("vulnerability") rather than viscerally felt, and the central plot mechanism—cracking a code—is resolved too conveniently, which softens the impact of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere until a final reconfiguration. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the storm becomes a lullaby, is earned within the story's mystical logic and lands effectively on the page. The cost is legible—the last star dies and the booklet's secrets are altered—providing a satisfying, if subtle, sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a contemplative state that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing, which is a valid structure for this length. The orientation is clear and the sequence of reflection is logical. However, the closure is weakened by an absence of felt cost; Zeta's realization brings only "peace" and "purpose," making the resolution feel too neat and undercutting the weight of the newfound understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a resonant final image. However, the closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lacks a legible cost; being "freed from the burdens of secrecy" is framed as a pure gain, weakening the sense of a trade-off. Causality is also soft, as the link between looking through a lens and suddenly being able to "eavesdrop on the whispers of the city" is symbolic rather than functional, which feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a quiet closure of Earned Stasis. The final moment where the dresser feels "known" by the garden is a legible resonant reconfiguration. However, the cost of reaching this state—the toil, the past deception—is a pre-existing condition rather than a price sharpened or paid at the climax, which slightly softens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain under a Causal lens, from repairing the simulator to proving the theory. The structure is sound and orientation is handled well. However, the closure—a Decisive Change in knowledge—lacks a meaningful, on-page cost; Kaelin's "reluctance" to return is immediately supplanted by wonder, weakening the resolution's impact by making the victory feel too complete.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is coherent and orientation is clear. However, the closure lacks a legible cost; Rachel gains peace and inspiration, but it's unclear what, if anything, is lost or traded, weakening the impact of her being "changed forever."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the layering of notes in the logbook. Orientation is clear, and the structure is coherent for its length. The ending achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing: Aria’s understanding of truth is fundamentally altered, with the "auroral sorrow" serving as a legible conceptual cost. However, the progression feels somewhat schematic; the shift from the station inhabitants' "wariness" to collaboration is asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens until the end, where a Causal turn resolves the plot. However, this resolution is critically flawed; the explorer "stumbled upon an old logbook" containing the exact truth they sought. This coincidental discovery is not earned by prior action, breaking causality and making the Conceptual Repricing at closure feel unearned and arbitrary. The fascinating psychic radio setup is abandoned for a generic trope.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a state of being rather than a causal chain of events. The structure is a clear, simple descent from observation to a state of stasis. The closure is a valid form of Earned Stasis (a Resonant Reconfiguration), with the cost—losing connection to the world above—legibly established on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. It builds atmosphere consistently toward the eclipse, which serves as the central deepening beat. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Eli is changed and Aria's purpose is reaffirmed. The story's causal chain is one of mood and perception, which holds together coherently from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building toward a quiet but legible closure. The structure is clear: discovery, investigation, and emotional resolution. The ending, where Emilia leaves with the story collected, serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her knowledge state. However, the felt cost is somewhat muted, relying on a general sense of poignancy rather than a specific, sharp price paid on the page for uncovering the tale of "love and loss."

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where The Oracle's life is "transposed"—is asserted rather than earned. The causal link between the conversation with the stranger and this profound internal shift is missing, as the key interaction is summarized. The final state change lacks a clearly legible on-page cost, weakening the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a ritual that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the causality is weakened by the very late introduction of "the possession." This core stake appears abruptly in the final paragraphs, feeling like an unearned, tacked-on explanation for the ritual's necessity rather than an integrated threat that drives the narrative from the beginning. This retroactive justification severely undermines the plot's structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully establishing its setting and mood. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the writer's purpose is crystallized—lacks a legible, on-page cost. The inspiration is achieved without a visible sacrifice or trade-off, making the final state feel asserted rather than earned. The "spell" breaking from exhaustion is mentioned as a future threat but does not impose a price on the actual resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from an initial state of potential to a decisive, transformed endpoint. Orientation is established immediately, and the progression through the internal "labyrinth" is logical within the story's fantastical framework. The closure unit is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, with the changed landscape and faded viaduct providing a legible conceptual cost for the protagonist's newfound power.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds atmospheric and emotional density toward a clear closure: a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria's internal state shifts from numbness to wonder and peace. The re-contextualization of the broken needle provides a felt sense of a conceptual cost being paid—letting go of a past mode of experiencing music to embrace a new one. The progression is logical within its non-causal framework.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens and successfully achieves closure in the form of Charged Poise, with the protagonist's final resolve. However, the structure is weakened by a highly convenient inciting incident (the random arrival of a plot-critical carrier pigeon) and a crucial plot point—the decryption of the message—that is summarized rather than dramatized. The leap from a "cryptic message" to a fully understood narrative about a "hidden laboratory" feels unearned and compresses the central discovery into a single, unconvincing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building atmosphere toward an emotional climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds peace, is present on the page. However, the key trigger, "the transformation was complete," is vague and lacks a clear causal link to her sudden grieving; it feels more like a convenient narrative signal than an earned development. The cost of grieving is stated but its weight is lessened by the rapid, tidy resolution that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. Orientation is clear, and the story builds density towards a final Conceptual Repricing where the poet's understanding is reconfigured. The closure lands with a felt, albeit abstract, cost—the acceptance of uncertainty. The plot is primarily an internal journey of discovery, which is executed coherently for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure moves coherently from a state of desolate quiet to a communal climax and concludes with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the "chronic hush." The 'before' (oppressive silence) and 'after' (meaningful stillness) are legible, and the emotional cost is processed on the page through the act of musical expression, satisfying the closure requirement for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page as the dealer completes her work and departs, with the cost of her emotional isolation felt throughout. The final image of the grotto's light returning creates a powerful, resonant cadence shift that lands with satisfying finality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on a cascade of extreme coincidences (finding the locket, the owner being right there, the prior connection via a misdirected letter) that serve as resolutions rather than complications, violating causal integrity. The structure is largely summary ("As the night wore on," "Lena returned to her office the next day"), telling the story rather than dramatizing it. The closure, a decision to start a project, is unearned as it comes at no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails structurally by presenting a summary of events rather than a dramatized scene; this is an outline, not a story. The causal chain is a weak "and-then" sequence, fatally undermined by the "Years went by" time skip, which dissolves any accumulated pressure. While a closure unit exists conceptually, it is entirely unearned by the plot's frictionless and overly compressed progression.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere toward a single perception-altering event. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, as Lyra's worldview and art are permanently altered. The cost is somewhat soft but legible—the magical state is temporary and the waking giant hints at future danger—which grounds the otherwise ethereal conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a contemplative mood that leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The before/after state is legible, shifting from "ambiguous loss" to "buried optimism," and the cost is felt during the ritual. However, the causality is weak; the specific mechanics of the ritual feel disconnected from the specific nature of the realization, making the plot feel more like a container for a theme than a process that generates it.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates on an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the connection between the memory-trigger and the climactic shift in purpose is tenuous. While the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—is on the page, the causal logic feels soft. The story accumulates atmosphere effectively but lacks the structural pressure to make the dweller's final stance feel inevitable or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully establishing a contemplative scene and landing a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the central turn—Emilia’s decision to embrace metamorphosis—is causally weak, pivoting on a single, unearned moment of "determination." While a quiet closure is valid, the path to it lacks the necessary pressure or nuanced progression to feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the progression feels convenient. The "wild goose chase" is summarized away, and the plot advances when a mysterious stranger with all the answers simply appears. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is achieved, but the journey to it lacks sufficient struggle, making the final "sense of closure" feel somewhat unearned. The cost is stated but feels thin.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal state toward a clear closure. The structure is simple but effective for this length: inciting incident (pilgrim's gift), rising action (delving into the cave), and resolution (a Conceptual Repricing of her clairvoyance). The final realization that her purpose is to "magnify the everyday magic" provides a resonant 'after' state, though the conceptual cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's structure is its primary weakness; it functions as a summary or montage rather than a dramatized plot. The core action—creating installations and the community's response—is told rather than shown, which flattens the narrative into a sequence of events without causal pressure. While an Accumulative/Textural lens applies, the closure (a healed harbor) feels asserted and sentimental, lacking a tangible cost paid on the page to earn the final, positive state.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a defined closure (a Conceptual Repricing of her worldview). However, the central plot point—the "unraveling" of mysteries—is entirely summarized in one sentence. Skipping the dramatization of the climax leaves a structural hole, making the character's transformation feel abrupt and unearned, even if the before/after state is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a coherent closure. The final image provides a Conceptual Repricing, where the town's memories are integrated into the "eternal symphony," offering a satisfying cadence shift. However, the plot is thin and the causality is entirely magical, with a simple find-transcribe-understand structure that lacks any meaningful complications or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is flawless, with each step logically following the last. The story successfully executes a Conceptual Repricing at its conclusion, where "goodbye" is re-evaluated with a clear, felt cost—the loss of a known, stable existence for an infinite, uncertain one. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly through this strong on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean causal chain within a single scene, culminating in a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The structure is tight, and the closure lands on the page with a clearly felt cost—the tension and risk of the impending action. The plot is simple yet structurally flawless for its length, with the Causal lens holding perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot structure is elegant and effective. The narrative progresses through a series of observations, successfully building density and atmosphere. The closure is a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the stationer's momentary satisfaction concludes the arc with a quiet, fitting cadence. The story is well-oriented and its simple structure serves its conceptual goals perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. There is no causal plot, but the structure builds a coherent mood and progresses toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end ("a sense of clarity emerged"). The closure lands, offering a re-contextualization of the "erased histories," but the felt cost of the journey remains abstract and intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a coherent ritual that builds in intensity toward a clear climax. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's state to "quiet satisfaction" and imbuing the setting with new purpose. The mystical causality holds within the story's established logic, earning its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates as a narrative summary rather than a dramatized scene, following an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. While it successfully establishes a Charged Poise closure where the community is united and ready to resist, the entire progression is told, not shown. The plot lacks on-page beats and tangible causal links, reading more like an outline of events ("She began to reorganize... As the graffiti spread, so did the sense of unity...") than a story with immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear emotional cost. The inciting incident (the message) effectively deepens the stakes. However, the structure is marred by a near-verbatim repetition of a full sentence ("The stillness of the scene was almost palpable..."), which reads as a significant editorial oversight and undermines the piece's structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a resonant atmosphere toward its closure. Orientation is clear, and the final state change (a functional drone) provides a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the structure lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure; the progression is linear and smooth, missing a turn that alters options or knowledge, which limits its structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a single discovery. The plot structure is sound, and orientation is handled well. The ending achieves a valid form of closure (Charged Poise), as Emilia commits to the final journey, but its impact is diluted by repetitive prose and a final line ("the journey was just beginning") that slightly undermines the decisiveness of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through rhythmic repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is coherent and orientation is clear. However, the final closure leap from a "faint" response and a "whispered promise" to the asserted "sound of a town reborn" feels abrupt and slightly unearned, softening the causal payoff of the accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure with a clear beginning, middle, and climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on a poignant image of Earned Stasis with a legible emotional cost ("melancholy and longing"). The plot is simple but effective for the story's length, with all beats logically connected and contributing to the final state.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sense of mystery and purpose. Closure is achieved through Charged Poise, with the sudden mention of "the bodies" crystallizing the stakes. However, this crucial piece of information arrives without prior setup, feeling more like an external injection of plot than a culmination of the preceding atmospheric exploration, which slightly undermines its structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, albeit linear and frictionless, causal chain from setup to closure. The Decisive Change—the alchemist's empowerment and the ghost's release—is legible and has a felt cost ("sense of loss"). However, the structure lacks any turns, complications, or reversals, reading more like a summary of events than a dramatized plot.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the structure is simple and functional, moving from evening to dawn. Orientation is clear. The closure is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, with the completed tapestry re-contextualizing the labyrinth's meaning. However, the plot lacks any meaningful tightening or deepening; the initial state of quiet determination persists unchanged until the work is simply done, making the narrative feel more like a vignette than a structured story with rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration for the character. Orientation is clear and the structure is coherent for this mode. However, the plot is a simple, frictionless summary of an excavation over weeks, lacking a meaningful tightening or on-page causal turn that would elevate it beyond a descriptive vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully establishing a continuous scene and moving to a clear closure of Charged Poise (the letter sealed, the potential released). However, it lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; the process is frictionless. The arrival of patrons, a potential point of pressure, is dismissed without consequence, weakening the structure's overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a clear closure of Charged Poise. The final image reconfigures the character's purpose and the story's stakes with a felt cost—the burden of knowledge. However, the central causal mechanism—how stitching reveals secrets—relies on abstract assertion ("synchronizing stitches with celestial rhythms") rather than a dramatized process, which softens the plot's logical foundation and makes the climactic revelation feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmospheric and emotional density towards a single, resonant climax. The structure is simple but effective, moving from approach to ritual to a cathartic release. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria's perspective is altered, lands cleanly with a felt cost ("a silence that was both peaceful and haunting"), fulfilling the requirements for this mode and length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story successfully builds a mood and lands its closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael finds peace. The structure is coherent for its type. However, the central causal link (decrypting the cast immediately leads to healing) feels overly simplistic and symbolic, thinning the credibility of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is simple but effective for the length, moving from discovery to creation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lena's internal state is changed, and the cost—leaving her art to be reclaimed by nature—is clear and felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory density toward a transformative climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena’s worldview shifts, lands cleanly on the page. The cost is the exchange of comfortable certainty for wondrous unknown, which is felt, even if the thematic statement is a bit too direct.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, establishing a situation rather than a causal plot. It achieves a form of closure (Earned Stasis), but the narrative arc is flat. The piece reads as an extended summary of a process ("As the days passed...") instead of dramatizing a specific, pressurized scene. There is no meaningful tightening or turn, just a description of a successful, unchallenged operation from beginning to end.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. The narrative builds pressure through memory and atmosphere, culminating in a clear on-page closure: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the poet achieves a state of peace (Earned Stasis). The cost—centuries of longing—is established, making the final quietude feel earned within the story's lyric logic. Orientation is immediate and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a resonant final state. The closure is a valid form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the caretaker recommits to her endless task with a felt cost of loneliness and impermanence. The structure is simple but effective, with a clear intensification and cadence shift during the song, fulfilling the requirements for this story length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building internal pressure toward a clear closure. The ending is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's internal state is reset, and she faces a future of new possibilities with a felt cost (the memory of isolation and the risk of it returning). The structure is simple and clean for this length, moving from stasis to a new potentiality without any causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Kaelin’s stance crystallizes. This structure is coherent for its mode. However, the inciting discovery—decoding the message by analyzing adhesive—is recounted as backstory rather than dramatized, weakening the sense that the on-page resolution is earned through action or a genuine causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building an emotional state that leads to a clear closure. The ending is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Emilia achieves a new, stable emotional equilibrium. The cost—accepting the permanent loss of her authentic past—is felt in the bittersweet tone. The structure is simple but effective, with all elements contributing to this final, quiet crystallization of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is coherent, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward a clear closure moment (the reunion). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands. However, the plot's causality is soft; the logbook code acts as a sudden key that resolves the central problem without further complication, making the "test of my resolve" feel less like a test and more like a single, successful step.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is coherent. The narrative progresses from arrival to a deepening attunement, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the character achieves their internal goal. The closure, while quiet, is legible, with the cost being the passage of time and the subtle, permanent change in both the character and the location.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. While the closure itself—understanding that paths are meant to be in flux—is coherent, the causal path to it is weak. The discovery of the seeds by a "migrating bird" functions as a convenient, external solution that moves the plot forward, rather than a development arising from the protagonist's specific actions or choices. The plot progresses but lacks earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story establishes a clear setting and follows a simple setup-performance-reflection structure. The closure is a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian prepares for his next act. However, the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; it's a static depiction of success, and the conceptual "cost" of his art is mentioned but not felt, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure—a Decisive Change where Aria successfully pens the verse on her skin—is on-page and lands with a felt cost, as the "weight of her elective exile" lifts, signifying the price of her prior isolation. The structure is simple but sound, building atmospheric and internal pressure toward a single, decisive intensification rather than relying on external causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The structure builds from observation to a single, catalyzing event (the stone) that deepens the protagonist's resolve, culminating in a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure, where her mind turns to her next creation, is an earned shift from passive contemplation to active artistic intent, with the cost being the acceptance of the moment's ephemeral nature.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Kael's pain is reconfigured as a purpose. Orientation is solid. However, the causality for this profound shift is weak; the magical box from a "mysterious stranger" functions as a deus ex machina, making the climactic epiphany feel unearned and diminishing the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens successfully. The structure is a simple but coherent progression: setup (meditation), intensification (vision), and resolution (renewed clarity). The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the overwhelming vision serves as the felt cost, solidifying her resolve. While the causality is atmospheric rather than strictly logical, it holds together within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building from one discovery to the next. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the cartographer accepts their role in the estate's narrative, with the cost felt in the line "left behind a piece of themselves." However, the structure lacks any turns or complications, reading more like a linear summary of events than a dramatized plot, which limits its structural depth.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere toward a clear climax. Closure is achieved as the painter succeeds in her goal, resulting in a Resonant Reconfiguration of the mirrors' state. However, the success feels asserted rather than earned, as the conflict lacks significant on-page struggle or a tangible cost paid in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the execution is weak. While the story has a clear orientation and a final closure image (a form of Earned Stasis), the entire central progression of the negotiation is summarized. The narrative asserts that a breakthrough occurred ("edged closer to a breakthrough") rather than accumulating the texture, pressure, or minor shifts that would make the final stasis feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story suffers a critical causality failure at its climax. After setting up a conflict against "powerful interests," the resolution bypasses this entirely, offering a magical, unexplained act of "releasing the waters." This deus ex machina resolution feels unearned, as no on-page obstacle is overcome, and the established stakes are ignored, rendering the closure hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is established, and the progression from observation to action to resolution is coherent under this lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands on the page, but the felt cost—"a reminder of all that she had lost"—is stated rather than viscerally demonstrated, slightly weakening the impact of the before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear, if simple, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a valid Charged Poise, where Amaranth's creative purpose is crystallized, and the cost is the felt "weight of her mission" and "trepidation." However, the plot is entirely internal, lacking a decisive on-page action beyond the act of writing, which keeps the causality somewhat muted and reliant on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds in atmospheric and symbolic weight towards a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Aria departs with renewed resolve leaving behind a charged space, lands with a clear, albeit quiet, felt cost related to the ongoing nature of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is sound and orientation is immediate. However, the closure is weakened because the cost (years of study, a long journey) is summarized backstory rather than a price paid or a trade-off made in the present scene, slightly diminishing the earnedness of her final peace.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, with the storm's intensification providing structure for the internal journey. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Hindsight's realization about chosen paths reweights their entire existence. The cost is conceptual—the loss of assumed agency—but it lands clearly on the page and provides a resonant final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure moment. The ending, a Resonant Reconfiguration, provides a new status quo for the astronomer as a "sentinel." The cost is the dissolution of their prior self-concept, which is legible within the story's mystical framework. The structure is simple but effective for its length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a simple, legible structure, but causality is weak. The inciting incident is a deus ex machina ("the music box...had found a way to reappear"), which conveniently enables the climax rather than arising from character choice. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the sanctuary's atmosphere, lacks a tangible, on-page cost; the transformation of the resentful is frictionless, undermining the narrative's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal resonance towards a clear closure. The structure is sound: discovery, motivation, process, climax, and a resonant final image. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the maker merges with her creation, lands effectively with a clear cost—the dissolution of her grounded self. The narrative progression feels purposeful and coherent within its magical-realist framework.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens, but the causal chain leading to the closure is weak and compressed. The leap from planting seeds to the orchard becoming a "place of pilgrimage" is summarized, not dramatized, undermining the earnedness of Aria's return. While the final reunion provides closure, it feels convenient, relying on off-page developments that are stated rather than shown, and the magical vitality of the orchard is a soft resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The sequence of events is coherent, and the final shift in the curator's understanding serves as a valid closure unit. However, the cost—accepting a new worldview—is more asserted than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot follows a logical causal chain but reads like a summary or outline of a longer story. Pivotal moments, such as the "rescue missions" and the crucial "renegotiation," are told rather than shown, which severely deflates their impact. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's purpose, is present but feels disconnected from the summarized events that supposedly earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of "The Garden." However, the closure is weakened by a soft sense of cost; the stated price of becoming "lost" in memory is immediately undercut by the final feeling of "peace," reducing the impact of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a climax. However, the closure—a form of Conceptual Repricing where Emilia gains understanding—completely lacks a visible or felt cost. This is a significant structural weakness, as the resolution is a frictionless acquisition of knowledge, violating the rubric's requirement for a price to be paid.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative structure, moving from a problem state to a resolution. However, the closure, while decisive, lacks any visible or felt cost. The "bloom of hush" is achieved without sacrifice, trade-off, or lingering consequence, which significantly weakens the narrative's impact and sense of earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear, linear sequence, establishing its orientation effectively. I'm inferring an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the narrative builds atmosphere toward its final image. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of hope—is critically undermined by a complete lack of on-page cost. The protagonist succeeds without setback or sacrifice, making the resolution feel hollow and robbing the structure of its potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is clean and effective for this mode: a steady intensification of atmosphere and internal pressure leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, where the archivist accepts her role, lands with a felt cost (the burden of memory) and a clear "after" state of peace, making the internal change definite and earned within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood until a final shift. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs, but the closure lacks a visible or felt on-page cost; the "hopelessness" is a reported past condition, and its resolution comes from a convenient, external discovery (the mosaic note) rather than an earned internal choice with a trade-off. This weakens the structural integrity, making the final inspiration feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a contemplative mood toward a quiet closure. The structure is coherent for this mode, and orientation is clear. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis or Conceptual Repricing as the chronicler finds clarity, is thematically consistent, but the cost—the passage of a night in thought—is too subtle to land with significant weight. The plot lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure before this resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. It establishes a unique condition, builds atmospheric pressure through the "gilded hush" and collected silences, and lands on a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. Eli's internal state is altered, and the cost—the experience fading into a dream—is legible. The story fulfills its structural promise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story operates on an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, and under that lens, its structure is coherent. It establishes a state, deepens it through descriptive texture, and lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration where the initial quiet has become a "palpable" silence. The closure is legible and the cost is the operator's day of work, but the overall lack of narrative turns or causal progression keeps it from higher marks.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical Causal lens, with each discovery leading directly to the next. Orientation is established immediately, and the structure builds effectively to a Decisive Change (claiming the throne) with a stated cost ("forever be bound to this place"). The primary weakness is that the causal chain is frictionless; solutions, like the ruby flake illuminating the path right after she reads the clue, feel convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot progresses logically from an inciting incident (fading threshold) to a clear climax (revitalizing the flame) and a decisive change in the character's stance on isolation. The closure lands effectively with a felt cost—the forfeiture of a long-held, protective solitude—making the before/after state legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story's causal logic is critically weak, relying on magical leaps rather than earned progression. The connection between Lyra using glitchy texts and the complex lab equipment responding is a narrative black box. While there is a Decisive Change at the end, it comes at zero cost, rendering the resolution hollow and unearned under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a single, continuous mystical experience. However, the closure lacks a felt cost; the protagonist's goal was to end the dynasty, and their final emotional state is "peace," which negates any sense of sacrifice. The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of future legacy, weakening the on-page immediacy of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration, where the knight merges with "possibility" and gains purpose, lands with a felt cost (the loss of their former self). The causal chain is mystical but internally consistent, moving from discovery to allegiance to transformation without structural flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure. The discovery of the button serves as the inciting incident, leading to a deepening of Emilia's internal state. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where her purpose solidifies. However, the cost is not deeply felt; her healing seems too easily won, making the final state feel less earned and more of a foregone conclusion from the moment the button appears.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a closure of Charged Poise. However, it fails the Cost proof test; the risk of reappearing and the "challenges" ahead are stated but not felt or paid on the page. This lack of a legible cost for the story's central action significantly weakens the structure's impact, preventing it from feeling earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure atmospherically rather than causally. The structure is clean: setup, performance, and resolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the prophecy's unease is replaced by a palpable peace, with the cost being the saxophonist's focused, intense effort. The before/after state is legible and the ending image is charged, fulfilling the core requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final Conceptual Repricing. However, the causal chain is simplistic (prod -> glow -> reveal) and lacks meaningful pressure or complication. The closure, while present, feels weightless because the supposed cost—the loss of her former self—is never dramatized, rendering the transformation an unearned assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Elian accepts uncertainty and steps into the unknown, is legible and lands on the page. The "cost" is the abandonment of his old, order-seeking self, which is felt. The structure is simple but effective for the story's length and internal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building a mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is sound for a short, reflective piece. However, the closure, while present, feels soft; the "cost" is a purely conceptual acceptance of past failures, making the final state of peace feel intellectually derived rather than earned through on-page struggle and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure with a valid, if simple, causal chain. Orientation is handled well. The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the collector continues her work—is present, but the cost (the "weight of her task") is asserted rather than demonstrated with specificity, weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, simple structure (wake-decide-enter-climax-return) appropriate for its length, and I inferred a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. Closure is achieved with a Decisive Change where the "penance" is lifted. However, the causal link at the climax is weak; the epiphany that resolves the conflict is stated rather than dramatized, feeling more like a convenient magical solution than a psychologically earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lena finds her purpose. However, a key causal link is weak and summarized: "Through the hidden details in the painting, Lena began to unravel the mystery." This crucial step of discovery is asserted, not shown, creating a logical gap that feels like an unearned epiphany. The closure lands, but the structure supporting it is partially hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building density effectively towards its closure. The orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ezra leaves with the story's emotional weight and a symbolic object, lands with a legible, felt cost ("weightless burden"), providing a satisfying and resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear closure moment. The structure is simple but coherent: discovery, inspiration, creation, and transformation. The ending lands as a Conceptual Repricing, where the destabilization of reality is the legible cost, successfully reweighting the story's world. The plot is functional and serves the atmospheric goal, though it lacks any surprising turns.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and reflection rather than causal events. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (an internal shift to a new stasis) with a legible on-page cost—the "burnished sorrow still present, but now tempered." The structure is coherent and well-suited to the story's introspective nature.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. It builds atmosphere toward a single, decisive moment of cadence shift when the music box plays. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, and the cost is made legible on the page with the line, "The golden chip, now dimmer." The plot is simple, but its form is perfectly suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds atmosphere effectively towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the structure is a simple, linear progression without a meaningful turn or intensification of pressure. The journey from entrance to revelation lacks the friction or complication needed to make the closure feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently moving from discovery to contemplation to creation. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Aria gains inspiration—lacks any tangible or felt cost. The inciting GPS failure is framed as a pure benefit, and the storm is an inspirational backdrop, not a threat, violating the requirement for a price paid to earn the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story operates as a compressed summary or montage, not a structured scene, which bypasses narrative tension. The drive is purely Accumulative/Textural, but the progression is a simple "and then" sequence of realizations without any meaningful tightening or reversal. While a final state of Resonant Reconfiguration is achieved, the path to it lacks causal rigor and the cost is so subtle it's nearly non-existent, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood effectively toward its conclusion. The closure is a valid form of Charged Poise, where Naomi's resolve is crystallized. However, the causal chain is weak; the pivotal "parley" that leads to her breakthrough is entirely summarized, making the subsequent understanding feel asserted rather than earned. The story tells us a change occurred but does not dramatize the mechanism of that change.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a contemplative mood. The closure unit—a Charged Poise at dawn followed by a Conceptual Repricing of the cove—is structurally present, but the cost is a weak, generic phrase ("the weight of their task"). The primary failure is the resolution; the entire revival is relegated to a hasty, unearned summary ("the town began to flourish"), which completely bypasses the need for causal, on-page action and deflates all accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end, where the unleashed prophecy and the waiting garden create a potent final image. The cost is the scribe's trepidation and loss of control, which lands effectively without needing a causal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building to a single point of realization. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the "vortex inheritance," lands on the page with a clear, albeit abstract, cost—a lifetime of responsibility. While the structure is sound for its mode, the causality of the final epiphany feels more asserted than earned through the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building a consistent mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure is on the page, and the shift in Ember's role represents a felt cost. However, the inciting incident—hesitating at the bell rope—is weakened by vague interiority like "as if she was waiting for something, though she didn't know what," which softens the causal link to her subsequent obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure, while lacking causal turns, effectively builds density toward its closure. The final image of the janitor leaving at dawn provides a clean Conceptual Repricing, re-evaluating their role with a felt, albeit subtle, cost (acceptance of a solitary life), satisfying the closure requirement for its mode.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive effectively. The structure is simple but purposeful, building atmosphere and weight toward the central act of opening the box. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the recluse accepts their role as guardian of memory, with the cost felt in the line "their heart heavy with the knowledge of what had been lost."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a state of understanding rather than a causal chain of events. The structure is coherent, moving from a problem to a method, a discovery, and a new equilibrium. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the key turn—receiving a response to a message—happens off-page and feels like a convenient, low-friction plot device rather than an earned breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. It builds atmospheric density, using the snapping kite string as a pattern break that reweights the stake of transience. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the poet reaches an Earned Stasis by accepting impermanence, with the lost kite serving as a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, summarizing events over months to build a sense of legacy. While the closure (an Earned Stasis) is clear and the cost (the caretaker's life) is legible, the narrative structure is entirely summary. The lack of any dramatized scenes or causal turns on the page means the plot is told to the reader, not shown, which significantly weakens its structural integrity for this form.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere toward a moment of connection. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the skeptic and entity stand on the brink of a new understanding. While the conceptual cost is legible, it feels somewhat thin, as the "before" state of skepticism was not deeply dramatized, lessening the impact of its transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood toward a single ritualistic act. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the landscape, is legible. However, the 'cost' that gives the act its weight is entirely historical (the past battlefield) and not felt or paid in the present moment, which softens the impact of the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot progression contains a significant and unearned causal leap. The solution to the riddle—Lyra realizing the answer is on the phonograph cylinder after Kael nuzzles the wax orb—lacks a clear logical or even intuitive link. This "and then a miracle occurs" moment undermines the story's structural integrity. While the closure, a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is on the page, the path to it feels contrived and overly convenient, weakening the sense of it being earned.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that shifts at the end into a Charged Poise. However, the closure is precipitated by a convenient coincidence—the compass glowing and aligning with the light—which resolves the character's internal conflict rather than complicating it. The cost of her past life is mentioned but not felt as a price for this new path.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a linear A-to-B structure. The primary flaw is the closure: while there is a Decisive Change (the sky is fixed), it comes at no discernible cost. The mission is a frictionless success, and the protagonist is simply "forever changed" in a positive way. High-level fiction requires a price to be paid for victory, and its absence here makes the resolution feel unearned and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clear, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The arrival of the historian serves as the inciting incident, and the plot escalates through the accumulation of symbolic weight. The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the characters' stances and potential with a felt, albeit abstract, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and knowledge that culminates in a Decisive Change (seeding a new reality). The closure is legible and on the page. The primary weakness is the cost; the "pang of sorrow" feels slightly understated as the sole price for altering existence, making the final decision feel less weighted than it could be. However, the structure is sound and delivers a complete, if simple, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical causal chain under a Causal lens: guilt prompts decoding, which reveals a path, which leads to a confrontation and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change in the tutor's internal state, with the cost being the confrontation with his past. However, the pivotal "confrontation" beat inside the labyrinth is narratively compressed, weakening the sense that the profound change was fully earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure that culminates in a clear moment of revelation. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "forgiveness" and the "ritual," lands effectively with a legible conceptual cost—the burden of a "beautiful and terrible" truth. The structure is sound and purposeful for its lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=2.5)
    This story fails the Orientation Test catastrophically, creating a fatal causality break. The protagonist is simultaneously in a workshop floating *on* an acid sea, working at a workbench, yet also holding her breath as if submerged, finally "break[ing] the surface." This spatial and physical impossibility makes the entire central conflict illogical. While a Resonant Reconfiguration closure is attempted, it cannot land with any weight when the actions leading to it are incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully landing a Conceptual Repricing at the end where the painter's mortality is weighed against her art's endurance. However, the central plot turn—stumbling upon the oasis—is an unearned coincidence ("she took a wrong turn") rather than a result of choice under pressure. This significantly weakens the narrative's causal spine, making the structure feel more like a sequence of thematic vignettes than a cohesive plot.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story's structure is coherent. It builds density toward an internal climax and concludes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elian's changed internal state). The cost—an "indelible mark on his soul"—is felt and conceptual, fitting the lens, though its stakes remain somewhat abstract and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. The plot progresses through the accumulation of clues and emotional weight, leading to a journey that reconfigures the protagonist's internal state. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the navigator confronts the "nothingness" of her loss and achieves peace, a resolution with a palpable, felt cost. The causality is atmospheric and emotional, which holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, where a series of discoveries logically build to a final realization. The closure is a well-defined Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the forager's resolve crystallizes with a felt cost. However, the progression depends on a sequence of convenient discoveries (eye, then messages, then cache) that feels more like a checklist than an organic unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is clean, building pressure through observation toward a clear closure moment. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael picks up the boutonnière, accepting the burden of the mystery. The cost—the "cumulative burden" of memory—is explicitly felt on the page, making the closure earned and legible within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a simple two-shard structure, but the causal linkages are weak and rely on convenience. The protagonist follows ants on a whim, and they happen to lead to the exact cavern needed to solve a mystery unrelated to ants. The crucial "series of trials" are entirely summarized, constituting a significant structural gap where earned progression should be. The closure is on the page, but the path to it feels arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.5)
    While the story follows a simple, linear structure, it suffers from a critical failure of closure. The ending completely summarizes the climax ("she found a truth that was both wondrous, and terrible") instead of dramatizing it. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page, and the declared cost is not felt, rendering the entire narrative arc a promissory note.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a mood and a series of observations toward a quiet insight. The structure is clear: observation, external prompt (the whisper), focused action, and resolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the alchemist's perspective shifts, landing on the final image of shared understanding. The "cost" is minimal, which keeps the score from rising, but the structure is coherent for its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the meditative act of writing. Orientation is clear, and the structure serves the internal journey well. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's view of their nostalgia is transformed from a source of pain to a creative catalyst, representing a legible "before/after" with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a simple, continuous structure that fits the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear, and the closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s perspective is crystallized. However, the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening; the "before" state is not established with sufficient tension, making the final "after" state feel more like an affirmation than a change earned through on-page pressure or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure is legible and the cost is present, if small (the "spent" quill). However, the plot's central turn—the runes whispering their secrets—feels like a convenient external event rather than a direct, earned consequence of Kaito's internal struggle, slightly softening the causal integrity of his breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. The structure is clean and the final emotional state feels earned. However, the introduction of "induced currents" as the mechanism for her magic is an un-scaffolded piece of jargon that clashes with the established ethereal tone, creating a minor but jarring break in the world's causal logic at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear, if simple, structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the universe is balanced and Aria accepts her new role, is on the page. However, the causal links are weak and metaphysical; things happen because the story asserts they do ("she wove together the disparate threads"), not because of a tangible chain of events, and the "cost" is more of a noble continuation than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the causal link between the central action (counting backwards) and the resulting "epiphany" is asserted, not demonstrated, weakening the sense that the final state of clarity is earned. While the structure is coherent and orientation is clear, the central mechanism of change lacks convincing on-page causality, feeling more magical than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a consistent mood. However, the structure lacks a meaningful turn or deepening. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Lena feels her connection to the world, is unearned as it results from passive observation rather than a choice made under pressure. The cost of this shift is not made legible on the page; the story ends on the promise of a breakthrough ("on the cusp," "on the verge") rather than its dramatized arrival, which significantly weakens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, where insights gather to produce a final shift in perspective. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into a state of determined purpose, is on the page and legible. The felt cost is the "clover melancholy" and the acknowledgment of the difficult road ahead, which is sufficient, but the causal chain relies heavily on convenient intellectual epiphanies rather than pressure-tested choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a coherent state rather than a causal chain of events. Orientation is clear. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the operator embraces the loop, a choice which forecloses other paths and lands with a felt, albeit melancholic, sense of peace. The structure is sound for its mode, but the lack of any meaningful tightening of pressure keeps it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.2)
    The structure is fatally flawed. An initial, static scene of reflection is abandoned for a multi-decade summary that tells the reader the story's legacy. This narrative leap breaks causality and deflates any accumulated texture. The on-page closure is merely a quiet moment of resolve before this coda begins, lacking a felt cost or a meaningful reconfiguration of options. The chosen Accumulative/Textural lens fails because the accumulation is simple repetition, not deepening density.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, where the shift in atmosphere builds pressure effectively. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration; Raven's internal state changes with a clear, felt cost, providing a satisfying and earned resolution that fits the story's gentle premise.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a clear, linear progression toward the stillpoint, building sensory and emotional density. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing on the page, where the mapmaker's understanding is reconfigured. The cost is the implied emotional journey, which is legible even if not deeply dramatized, making the closure strong and valid for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a series of reflections that lead to a clear closure. The ending is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Aria, pen restored, accepts her new role. The "cost" is the reframing of her prior failure as a necessary step and the acceptance of responsibility, which is legible but lacks visceral weight. The structure is simple but coherent and effective for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building emotional and atmospheric density toward its climax. The structure is coherent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor's atmosphere is permanently altered, and the old man is left with a transformed memory, a form of Earned Stasis with a felt emotional cost of transience.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a simple Accumulative/Textural structure: arrival, inspiration, creation, and revelation. The closure, a form of Resonant Reconfiguration, is legible as Elian internalizes the uncovered truth and recommits to their solitary path. However, the causal links are weak; the inspiration to create a "trail of artistic creations" for an unseen audience in a lost archive feels contrived and strains credulity, weakening the plot's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds pressure through the intensification of Aria's drumming and the environment's response, leading to a coherent climax. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, where Aria achieves a new level of resolve, and the felt cost—the fleeting nature of the connection—is made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood through a series of discoveries (coin, map, key). However, the causal links are weak, relying heavily on coincidence—the key happens to fall from the map, the stranger happens to be in the new area. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where she proves her thesis, lands as intended but feels unearned by prior choices, making the "and then" structure feel more mechanical than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot is not causal but rather a sequence of symbolic actions that effectively build atmospheric pressure. The structure culminates in a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the guardian remains, but the encounter has re-charged the atmosphere with a lingering sense of connection and loss, providing a clear before/after state with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates on an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the causality is critically weak. The leap from Elian visualizing window displays in a grotto to them manifesting across town is unexplained magical thinking that breaks narrative logic. While the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the central mechanism for achieving it is absent, making the plot feel more like a summary of a fable than a dramatized sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the "island" becomes a "state of being," is legible and lands with a felt, if abstract, cost (shedding a "former self"). The structure is simple but effective for this lens and length, moving from obsession to a decisive, transformative act.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural structure, which is appropriate for its reflective nature. The discovery of the bouquet provides a sufficient deepening beat, re-focusing the narrative. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on a final image of Charged Poise with a legible emotional cost ("a deep sadness") that reweights the story's emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story's structure is a masterful use of the Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure perfectly through sensory detail toward an effective on-page Resonant Reconfiguration as closure, with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but struggles with causality. The progression reads as a sequence of thematic statements rather than events building on each other. The final closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is resonant in its imagery but feels unearned because the preceding "awakening" lacks a visible cost or a credible process of change for the glassblower. The plot is less a structure and more a gentle, tensionless drift toward a predetermined conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully establishing a progression of deepening awareness. The structure is clear: an inciting incident (cleaning the lens) leads to exploration and culminates in a moment of Earned Stasis. However, the plot is a simple, linear sequence of events without any meaningful turns, complications, or causality beyond "and then," which limits its structural sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot structure is sound. The orientation is clear, and the narrative progresses logically within its magical framework, moving from setup (grief, the curtains) to action (origami) to climax (illumination) and closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where the character's hope is renewed, lands on the page with a felt cost (grief transmuted), providing a clear before/after state. The causal mechanism is fantastical, but it remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a coherent, single-scene narrative arc from dusk to dawn. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing, where the "map to a hidden treasure" represents a reconfigured understanding, earned by the night's labor. The structure is simple but well-suited to the story's length and meditative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and layering concepts toward a central transformative experience. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the historian's perception, is present on the page with a legible, if somewhat abstract, cost ("anguish"). The structure is sound for its length, but the causal chain is magical rather than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the shadow is understood as humanity's collective fear. This realization reconfigures the protagonist's stance, leading to a Charged Poise ending as she resolves to act. The cost is the "weight of her task," which is felt, if somewhat abstractly, making for a coherent and complete structural arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the inciting incident—"After the con was revealed"—is a critical weakness. Its vagueness renders the central problem abstract and lowers the felt cost of Lena’s transformation, making the structure feel emotionally ungrounded despite its atmospheric coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Holding an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story progresses to a moment of closure, but fails the cost-proof test. The breakthrough is achieved through effort ("ragged breathing"), but this physical exertion is a negligible price for the profound cosmic insight gained. The initial setup of a reopened wound is a potential cost that is completely abandoned, leaving the closure feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building from a concrete anchor (the film strip) to a resonant vision. The structure is coherent, with a clear setup, deepening, and cadence shift. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding is altered, and this change lands clearly on the page, satisfying the requirements for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the sustained ritual until a breakthrough occurs. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration leading to an internal change, is on the page and legible. The implied cost is the long-term devotion "across an unwritten calendar," which fits the structure, though a more immediate, felt cost at the climax would have strengthened it further.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully. The plot progresses through a series of intensifying actions leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dune's state is changed. The closure lands with a felt cost (Asa's temporary dissolution), but the mechanics of "wave functions" and "charming" the archive are too abstract to feel fully earned, functioning as magical permissions rather than coherent causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through the intensifying "hum." The closure is a legible Conceptual Repricing, where the rainforest is re-framed as a "gateway." The cost is present, if abstract, in the risk of being "consumed." The structure is coherent for this lens, but the lack of causal friction or unexpected turns keeps it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual. The structure is a simple, effective linear journey. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), as the travelers arrive at a threshold, reconfiguring their options and stakes for the next stage with a palpable, if not yet paid, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    For an Accumulative/Textural drive, the structure is very effective. It establishes the situation and dominant stake, introduces a small event to deepen the central question, and builds to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, an Earned Stasis where the bellhop accepts their vow, lands on the page with the felt cost of their lost voice having been present throughout. The story holds its lens consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building Kael's preparations toward a decisive climax. The structure is sound and closure is achieved on the page with the pretender's unmasking, a clear Decisive Change. However, the resolution itself feels unearned; the victory comes from "words, laced with the power of the rune of drift," a magical solution that sidesteps the supposed method of cryptic messages, weakening the causal link between the story's core activity and its outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a coherent mood and internal pressure toward a clear closure moment. The final Conceptual Repricing, where Maya realizes the truth lies in the sea's rhythms, not the data, lands effectively with a felt cost—the abandonment of empirical certainty. The structure is a simple, effective single scene that supports this quiet epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot builds pressure through sensory and atmospheric intensification, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with a clear, felt cost on the page. The causality is perfectly aligned with the chosen narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with each discovery leading directly to the next step. The closure, unsealing the embryo, is a Decisive Change that occurs on the page. However, the plot lacks a legible cost; the ending is framed as a pure triumph, undercutting the narrative's weight by resolving the central problem without a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory pressure toward a clear point of closure. The ending, an Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page; Amira's shift from being actively haunted to carrying a new sense of peace is legible. The felt cost is the acceptance of her permanent trauma, now balanced by a newfound coping mechanism, making the structure sound and satisfying for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the repetition and intensification of images. The structure is a single, coherent scene leading to a clean closure. The ending is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the artist’s new stance is crystallized on the page with a felt cost—the acceptance of "necessary darkness"—making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an accumulative structure, building from clue to revelation. It achieves a form of Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure fails the cost-proof test: the protagonist gains profound understanding without any discernible sacrifice, trade-off, or lingering consequence, which significantly weakens the narrative's structural integrity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal drive. The plot moves logically from discovery to decision to consequence, culminating in a powerful closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Aria's status from archivist to revolutionary with a clearly legible cost of "trepidation" and unleashing uncontrollable events, satisfying the requirements for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story functions effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a coherent mood toward a clear closure of Earned Stasis. The final image of Aria sleeping peacefully provides a resonant affirmation of her renounced path, with the sword's presence marking the cost. However, the structure is entirely descriptive, lacking any causal tightening or plot progression, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through a deepening of atmosphere and spiritual attunement, leading to a well-earned climax. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, where the fisher's connection to the garden is deepened, providing a legible before/after state with a felt (if positive) cost of ritualistic effort. Orientation is immediate and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to build toward a clear moment of closure. The final beat is a well-executed Charged Poise, where Adelaide's decision to act crystallizes with a felt sense of cost ("no matter the cost"). The structure is simple but effective for this internal journey, moving coherently from the inciting call to a formulated plan.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Holding an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot functions by layering atmospheric pressures (firmware, letters, time folding) to force an internal shift. The closure, a resolution of her guilt, is legible and earned within this symbolic logic. However, the causal links are often soft; for instance, the cord tethering her to the present feels more like a convenient magical solution than a consequence of a developed system.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and repetition to a legible closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where the artist's stance toward her unease shifts, is clear and lands on the page. The cost—accepting ongoing mystery—is felt, providing a coherent if somewhat gentle structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmosphere and internal resolve toward a clear point of closure. The final act of renaming serves as a legitimate Conceptual Repricing, redefining the plaza's meaning with a felt cost—the burden of hope Aria carries. The structure is simple, appropriate for the length, and holds together without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through an intensification of atmosphere and magical energy, leading to a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration at the end where Echo finds peace. The closure lands with a felt cost of bittersweet nostalgia, making the "before/after" state legible. The structure is sound for its chosen mode, moving from a clear inciting incident (touching the coin) to a climactic immersion and a quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a sequence of sensory and internal experiences that lead to a creative breakthrough. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is earned as Luna establishes a new, sustainable creative method. However, the static shock as a catalyst feels slightly convenient, a jolt of external causality in an otherwise internal, textural progression that borders on a soft reset of her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a sequence of experiences toward a final emotional state. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Aria solidifies her purpose. However, the required cost is nearly absent; the "unsettling" feeling of being "pulled apart" is mentioned once but is immediately resolved, weakening the impact of the final stasis and making the journey feel frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building toward a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the central causality is critically flawed; the link between the action (cataloging buttons) and the result (unscrambling a prophecy) is asserted but never dramatized, feeling more like a magical convenience than a coherent process.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres as a mood piece culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure unit is on the page, and orientation is clear. However, the causal links are weak; the search for "codes in accumulated snow" is abandoned for a path that conveniently appears, making the progression feel arbitrary rather than inevitable. The cost is the acknowledgment of past trauma, but its lifting feels more like a magical release than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through atmosphere and the duration of the wait rather than causal events. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from solitary waiting to shared, serene understanding is made legible, with the "eternity" of waiting serving as the felt cost. The structure is simple but elegant and holds perfectly from beginning to end.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds atmosphere and internal pressure through a sequence of sensory details (glass, thrumming, honey scent, smoke) that cohere into the final realization. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the oasis is re-contextualized by the idea of infused kindness. The cost is the resolution of Akira's quest, replacing mystery with a quiet, resonant peace.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a deepening of mood and purpose, anchored by resonant images rather than traditional causal events. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page as the gardener accepts their role, with the cost of a "past life" felt in the final image of the lockmaster's tooth. The lens holds perfectly from the inciting petal drop to the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through deepening reflection rather than causal turns. The single-scene structure is coherent and orientation is clear. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra's internal stance crystallizes, which is a valid and earned resolution for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, where images and events layer to produce a final shift. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing ("the thread...was not something to be found, but something to be created"), and the cost is the abandonment of a passive worldview. The narrative progression is coherent and effective for this quiet, internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a simple Causal lens, but the closure lacks weight. The central conflict is resolved instantly and completely by a single action, which reads as a "deus ex machina." The Decisive Change occurs, but there is no visible or felt cost for Lyra or the community, which undermines the stakes and makes the resolution feel unearned and simplistic. The story avoids any genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, causal "A-to-B" structure, and the closure is a legible Conceptual Repricing. However, the associated cost is extremely weak; a "pang of wistful rebellion" lacks the weight to make the transformative climax feel earned. The use of a drafting compass to pick an ancient, rusted lock is a moment of convenient causality that slightly undermines the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens within a single, continuous scene, which is appropriate for its scope. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters gain a new understanding, provides a clear before/after state. However, the felt cost of this change—confronting emotional pain—is more asserted than viscerally demonstrated on the page, slightly weakening the impact of the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure with a discernible accumulative drive. The plot moves from a professional investigation to a personal existential crisis, anchored by the discovery in the journals. The closure is a valid Charged Poise, framing the final stakes, but the cost—the "spongey dread"—is asserted more than it is a direct consequence of a specific, irreversible action within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building from image to reflection to action. The structure is logical, with each element leading to the next, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing where the fiddler's past is re-framed. The closure lands with a felt, if internal, cost (the release of a long-held burden), making the before/after state legible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Conceptual Repricing at the end where Kael reframes his failure. The structure is simple but coherent, and the closure lands on the page. However, the cost of the journey—the failure of "Echo Routes"—is purely intellectualized. There's no visceral sense of what was lost, which softens the impact of his final, peaceful acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building toward a resonant reconfiguration. The structure is a simple, continuous scene, which is appropriate. The closure, an Earned Stasis where Lyra finds peace, lands with a felt cost of her long effort. However, the causal chain for her breakthrough is soft, relying on a mood shift rather than a concrete discovery that changes her options.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a simple linear structure, moving from entrance to discovery to revelation. A Conceptual Repricing (CR) occurs on the page when the mirror's meaning is re-evaluated, providing closure. However, the causal chain is weak; the druid's attribute "finds lost things" functions as a convenient plot device to deliver the climax, and the inciting incident ("after the magic trick failed") is disconnected from the main scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a clear climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the "covenant" is revealed as a "blueprint," lands cleanly on the page. The felt cost is legible in the shift from seeker to creator, captured by the final image of the "boundless canvas," which functions as a form of Charged Poise. The narrative is a single, continuous scene with clear orientation and causality under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.2)
    Holding an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot establishes a clear atmospheric trajectory but fails the cost-proof test for its closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's state feels unearned because the price—"pouring all her energy into the spell"—is merely stated, not made legible on the page. The cause-and-effect of the spell is magical convenience rather than a process with tangible friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the phone call serving as a clear inciting incident. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Jack's perspective shifts, establishing a new stance toward his future. However, the felt cost of this shift is somewhat muted by the overly positive and declarative nature of the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure is critically flawed. The central action—the "work" Elara performs to reestablish the connection—is completely elided ("Elara set to work... As she worked, the mist around her began to clear"). This creates a major causal gap between her internal realization and the external resolution. Furthermore, the ending lacks any visible or felt cost, making the successful outcome feel unearned and robbing the closure of its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, establishing a coherent state of being. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the librarian stands as a guardian. However, the structure lacks any meaningful deepening; it layers concepts without intensifying the texture or shifting the cadence, resulting in a static portrait rather than a progression. The "cost" of this stasis is alluded to (loss of time, a former life) but feels abstract and without weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but its closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, fails the cost test. The narrative states that dissolving her internal barriers was "not a simple one," yet this cost is never made legible on the page through action, struggle, or sacrifice. The causal chain is a series of passive realizations rather than motivated choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that leads to an internal shift. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts the journey over the destination, is legible and earned within this structure. The plot is minimal but coherent for the chosen lens, moving from stasis and reflection to an expressive act (playing music) that enables the final emotional cadence. Orientation is clear from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands with a felt cost as the dreamer is "forever changed." However, the causal chain of discovery is weak; actions like "measure the propagation delays" are asserted without tangible mechanics, making the progression feel more like a sequence of poetic vignettes than a tightly woven accumulation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story establishes a valid closure form (Charged Poise) but fails the causal test required to earn it. The pivotal moment—where Elian gleans the violin's entire history from coffee stains—is a complete black box. The line "the violin's history... now lay before her like an open book" is an assertion that replaces a necessary scene, breaking the because/therefore linkage and making the subsequent resolution feel arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, as Aria achieves a state of readiness for death, with the "threshold of stillness" receding. The cost—confronting her mortality and sorrow—is felt and legible, making the final peace deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the progression is weak. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Aria understands the hairpin's symbolism, feels unearned and convenient rather than the result of accumulated pressure. The link between climbing a tree and achieving this specific insight is tenuous. While a closure unit exists, its causality is flimsy and the associated cost is abstract and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Applying an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is coherent. It establishes a mood and set of symbolic objects that build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure unit—the glimpse of self in the mirror—lands with a clear, felt cost. However, the central plot point, the "unhooking," is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the sense of a process and making the resolution feel asserted rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in the student's understanding—a valid, on-page closure. However, this closure lacks any visible or felt cost. The lesson is imparted flawlessly without sacrifice, struggle, or trade-off, which significantly undermines the structural integrity and emotional weight of the resolution, as there's no price for the earned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at the end. The closure lands cleanly, with the cost being the immense passage of time and the absorption of the wandering pulse. While the structure is sound for its mode, the progression feels linear and lacks a meaningful tightening or turn that truly redefines the stakes before the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a moment of insight. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eira's purpose is renewed, which is a valid form. However, the cost is nearly invisible; the change is entirely positive and frictionless, weakening the "before/after" legibility and making the resolution feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final realization. While the structure is coherent and orientation is clear, the causal link at the climax is fragile; the epiphany arrives via observation, not as a direct result of the preceding actions. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost—that he will be "changed forever"—is stated without being felt, weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a single, continuous ritual. The structure is simple but effective: setup (prophecy), process (distillation), and closure. The ending lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration ("wavelength... align with the purpose") with a conceptual cost—the shift from doubt to certainty. The causality is atmospheric and procedural, which is appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story successfully builds a somber mood toward a clear closure of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The reaper doesn't solve their grief but finds a new way to endure it, a state change with a felt cost of continued melancholy. The primary weakness is the tenuous link between the central action (crystallizing echoes) and the emotional resolution; the causality is symbolic and asserted, not viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, continuous scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from setup to action to resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands cleanly with the tolling of the bell, signaling the restoration of balance. However, the plot lacks any meaningful tightening or complication; it is a simple, linear execution of a task without any turns, making the progression feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens, concluding with a legible Charged Poise. However, it introduces a specific causal promise—"a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory"—that is never fulfilled on the page. This structural failure leaves the narrative feeling incomplete, as the central mechanism for achieving the stated goal is set up but never deployed or resolved, undercutting the entire plot.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is clean, moving from observation to discovery to a climactic insight. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s understanding is reweighted with the conceptual cost of humility, which lands cleanly on the page. The progression feels organic to the story's reflective nature.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sustained focus. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lyra's night of work culminates in a new understanding and a reaffirmation of her role, with the cost being her fatigue and the weight of responsibility. However, the claim that her discovery will "change their mission forever" feels somewhat overstated and unearned within the quiet scope of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens within a single continuous scene, and orientation is clear. It successfully delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as a closure unit. However, the cost is primarily recounted as past pain rather than felt on the page during the final turn, which weakens the causal weight of the transformation; the shift from turmoil to peace feels asserted and abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure. The inciting incident (seed's arrival) leads to a sustained build-up of internal reflection that culminates in a Decisive Change: the proprietor begins outlining the new room. This closure lands on the page with a felt cost of exhaustion, making the before/after state legible. The causal chain is purely internal but coherent under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward an on-page closure: the return of laughter. However, the final third abandons this scene-based structure for a series of summary-heavy epilogues ("Years would pass...", "The maestro's legacy lived on..."). This severely weakens the closure by telling the long-term effects instead of allowing the final, hard-won image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a resolution. Orientation is clear. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the guardian's internal state shifts from melancholy to acceptance, which lands cleanly on the page. The "cost" is the shedding of her former burdensome perspective, which is legible within this non-causal structure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens: the alchemist performs a specific action which therefore results in a changed reality. The structure is sound for the length, with a clear setup, escalation, and a Decisive Change for closure. However, the felt cost is minimal; breaking a "stifling destiny" reads as a pure victory, with the mention of "trepidation" feeling fleeting and not integrated into the final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final realization. However, the closure is critically flawed by a lack of legible cost. The story asserts a "truth that would change her life forever," but this truth is never revealed, and its impact is not dramatized. The final Resonant Reconfiguration feels unearned because the protagonist sacrifices nothing and risks nothing to achieve it, undermining the entire narrative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere towards a clear Charged Poise closure with a felt cost. However, the central plot turn—the deciphering of the symbols—is a critical causal gap. The phrase "She deciphered the symbols via interconnected patterns" is a complete hand-wave, replacing a crucial scene of discovery with a summary, weakening the story's structural integrity at its pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory intensification rather than causal turns. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively; the architect returns to the start, but her perception is permanently altered. However, the structure is weakened by a repetitive final third that summarizes the experience rather than letting the closing image resonate, slightly dulling the impact of the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a simple, linear sequence under an Accumulative lens, but it lacks any meaningful turn or deepening. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the city, is present but feels unearned because no real struggle preceded it. The narrative functions as a straightforward statement of progress without the causal friction that makes a plot compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward an emotional release. The structure is sound for its length, with clear orientation and a single, continuous scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the woman finds peace, is achieved on the page, and the cost of processed grief is legible. However, the causality is softened by convenient symbolism, as when the mist clears precisely as Aria's words land, which feels a bit too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot contains a critical and unresolved causal break: Lyra needs the "gold fleck" from the codex margins to open the lock that protects the codex. The story bypasses this paradox entirely by simply stating, "With the codex in hand..." This failure of logic undermines the entire central sequence. The closure is a Decisive Change (escape), but the cost is asserted ("changed") rather than shown, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. The story progresses from a state of seeking to a state of understanding, accumulating atmosphere and imagery along the way. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, as Akira's new understanding is crystallized in the final action of dropping the shard, signifying a release. The felt cost is the letting go of her obsessive quest for answers in favor of a quieter wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive. It introduces its core elements—the setting, the character, the stakes (dying language), and the tools (birds, diamond)—and builds pressure toward a clear closure. The ending is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the storyteller's voice fades, the diamond's curse is transformed, and the canyon is left with a new, living language. The cost—the death of the old language and the subsuming of the creator into their creation—is conceptually legible and gives the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The structure is simple and effective for its length: entry, reception of tools, internal shift, and resolved exit. The closure is on the page, with Lena's newfound determination representing a clear "after" state, poised for future action with a palpable sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear, linear A-to-B structure fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the closure—a Decisive Change where statues become human—lacks any visible or felt cost. This unearned resolution, where a benevolent action has only positive consequences, severely undermines the narrative's structural integrity, as there is no price paid for the wonder regained.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain under a Causal lens: the mailman receives a task, faces an obstacle, and completes it. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of his work, is achieved on the page with the delivery and his return. However, the final paragraph over-explains this closure, weakening its impact by summarizing the resonant shift that the preceding action had already established. The structure is sound, but the landing is softened by telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot progresses through a deepening of atmosphere and sensory experience, rather than strict causality, which is appropriate for the lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carpenter’s purpose is renewed, is earned and lands cleanly on the page. The subtle, felt cost—the dissipation of the magical moment—is legible and fitting for the story’s quiet nature.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure. The ending provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where the stories are reawakened, creating a legible before/after state. The cost—the "countless hours" and "painstaking process"—is stated but feels somewhat abstract, lacking a more visceral on-page price for her success.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a dense atmosphere around a central ritual. The structure culminates in a valid closure of Earned Stasis, where the character accepts the endless nature of their pursuit. However, the felt cost of this stasis—perpetual unfulfillment—is stated rather than viscerally demonstrated, which softens the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, linear structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from seeking to finding to acting to resolution. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the idea is freed, the clearing is changed, and the locksmith pays a felt emotional cost ("releasing a piece of themselves"). The plot is simple, but it is coherent and its conclusion is earned within the story's own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building mood and purpose toward a clear closure. Orientation is handled effectively in the opening. The ending achieves a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Emilia's resolve crystallizes with a felt cost—"the weight of her task settling onto her shoulders." The structure is sound and well-suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, which it executes flawlessly. The structure builds intensity not through causal turns but through a deepening focus, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist's understanding shifts. The closure lands with a felt cost—the intense mental "wrestling"—and the final image of the quiet library reconfigures the setting from forgotten to resilient, making the before/after state legible.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and effect that culminates in a clear closure of Earned Stasis. The structure is simple and functional for this lens. However, the progression lacks meaningful causality; the magic works because the story says it does, and the transformation occurs without a visible or felt cost beyond the expenditure of energy, which seems to invigorate her.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Causality is textural rather than strictly linear, with the unraveling leading to an intensification of silence that culminates in a clear resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the spirits find stasis and the restorer finds a charged purpose, lands cleanly with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, but the central causal link is absent. We are told the video footage “yield[s] their secrets,” but the story fails to show what specific patterns or changes led to Elara's profound epiphany. This renders the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the henge’s silence becomes a language—intellectually understandable but emotionally unearned, as the cost or price of this new knowledge is not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure excels under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving through a sequence of resonant discoveries. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing of "letting go," with the final image providing a legible cost in the form of emotional and intellectual weight. Causality is effective for this mode; the journey from object to insight is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is coherent: a state of pondering is intensified by atmospheric pressure (the storm), leading to a central creative act that culminates in a quiet but meaningful climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the balladeer establishes a connection and gains self-insight, feels earned within this framework, with the cost being the expenditure of creative energy and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the structure serves this mode well. The elevator ascent/descent provides a clean frame. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's perception of the spire shifts from prison to sanctuary. While the cost—taking on the emotional weight of the diary—is somewhat abstract, the before/after state is legible and the structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a final Resonant Reconfiguration. While the structure is coherent for this mode, the closure lacks a sufficiently legible cost. The final peace settles over Lyra too easily, without a clear sense of what was sacrificed or overcome; the storm's earlier "trail of destruction" feels like distant backstory rather than a present weight that makes her final stasis feel truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere toward its closure. The final moment is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the transient act of creation is revalued in the face of certain destruction, with the loss of the library as a felt cost. The causal chain is slightly weakened by the convenient discovery of the safe, but the core structure holds and delivers a resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical causal chain under a Causal lens: the discovery of the luminance leads to the study, which connects to the hopscotch board, leading to the map. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and pacing for its length. The ending achieves a well-executed Charged Poise, as Eli is ready to act on their new knowledge, reconfiguring their future path with the felt cost of secrecy and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a simple, linear causal structure (finds text, follows clues, opens door) that is easy to follow. The selected drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure lacks a meaningful, felt cost; the protagonist achieves enlightenment without any significant struggle or sacrifice, which weakens the impact of the final realization and makes it feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a simple "and-then" summary structure, lacking causal depth and tension. The central plan unfolds without any significant obstacles, reversals, or complications, making the resolution feel unearned. While a form of closure (Earned Stasis) is present, the cost—"tireless work"—is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening its impact. The Accumulative/Textural lens is appropriate, but the story accumulates description rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Following an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. The story establishes its setting and stakes, builds atmospheric pressure through the deepening dusk and hush, and resolves into a state of Earned Stasis. The closure lands cleanly, with the cost of the adjuster's burden being settled into peace, providing a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot follows a simple and-then sequence. A significant causal weakness occurs at the inciting incident: the falling nut, a pure coincidence, resolves the weeks-long search for the blueprint, violating the principle that coincidence should not resolve core problems. While the final closure (labyrinth reactivated) is on thepage, the cost is minimal, limited to effort and a vague sense of risk, weakening the impact of the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is established immediately, and the internal journey builds steadily to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a felt cost—the transformed memory of lost time with her sister—and successfully reweights her professional and personal purpose. The structure is sound and effective for its aims.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing, which is a valid structure. Orientation is swift and clear. The primary weakness is a causal gap: the connection between the method ("quantifying absence") and the resulting epiphany ("the air around her seemed to thicken... a sense of clarity emerged") is asserted rather than demonstrated, making the crucial turn feel magical rather than earned by the character's specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a coherent two-shard structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The primary weakness is the transition, "At the close of an unspoken dream," which feels like a convenient ellipsis rather than a motivated causal link. However, the closure lands cleanly on the page with a Decisive Change in Elara's state, and the cost of her psychic struggle is legible, making the overall structure effective despite the soft transition.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood toward a final resonant image. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the silos—lacks a visible or felt cost. The transformation feels unearned because it's achieved through a cooperative conversation without struggle, making the final state change feel too easy and diminishing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building internal pressure toward a legible closure. The ending, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara’s identity, is established on the page. However, its impact is significantly diluted by the final two paragraphs, which shift from a resonant moment of completion into a summary-heavy epilogue, softening the felt cost and undercutting the immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain (doodle → grotto → discovery) that is easy to follow. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "seeds of vigilance" paired with a Charged Poise for her future quest, lands with a clear, albeit conceptual, cost of responsibility. The structure is sound for the length, but the central discovery feels somewhat frictionless, progressing from clue to solution without a significant misstep or complication to test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds its atmosphere effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the quality of silence is altered. However, the causal foundation is weakened by the arbitrary, unexplained backstory element of "the hedgehog uncurled." The plot is a simple, successful sequence rather than a structure that tightens or deepens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that leads to a legible closure. The ending, where the tutor rises with a new sense of purpose, functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost ("exhilarating and terrifying"). While the internal causality is soft, the structure is coherent and the final shift provides a clear before-and-after state.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, aiming for a `Charged Poise` closure. However, the central plot mechanism is critically flawed. The obstacle of the locked clasp is overcome by a magical, unexplained ability ("tune the frequencies"), which functions as a deus ex machina. This completely bypasses the core conflict of trust versus curiosity, making the resulting epiphany feel unearned and the closure lack a felt cost for the transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but its causal structure is critically weak. The climax is triggered by an external, undefined event—"the turning of the tide's thought"—which functions as a deus ex machina, resolving the central question of when the seed will bloom without any action from the protagonist. While a Conceptual Repricing closure lands, the narrative arc is a simple, linear summary rather than a structured plot with meaningful turns. The story substitutes magical convenience for earned causality at its most pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens: Lyra's mission leads her to follow amplified phenomena, resulting in a discovery. The closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing, where the understanding of the orchard's resilience is fundamentally changed. The plot is logical and well-structured for its length, with clear orientation and sequencing, but the journey feels frictionless, lacking any genuine setbacks that would test the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building observations toward a final, internal shift. The structure is simple but effective for the length: arrival, investigation, realization, and departure. Closure is achieved as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the investigator leaves with a new resolve and a felt burden of knowledge, effectively reconfiguring her stance toward her mission without a decisive physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure builds sensory density toward a clear climax and resolves into a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian's perspective is affirmed. The closure lands cleanly, but the on-page cost is subtle ("the amber music sheet, now a little worn"), which slightly softens its impact. The causal logic within this textural framework is sound and orientation is clear from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a single climactic event and resolving with a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is handled well, and the structure is sound for its length and mode. The closure lands on the page, but its felt cost is vague; the transformation is framed entirely as a gain ("insights she had harvested"), which softens the impact of the required price for her change.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmospheric decay (vanishing stars) rather than causal plot turns, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear sense of cost—a terrifying new reality—and reconfigures the character's purpose, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood toward a coherent closure. The final encounter provides a quiet but definite Resonant Reconfiguration of Eira's purpose. The "cost" is subtle—the fleeting nature of the connection—but sufficient for the story's gentle arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is coherent and the orientation is clear. However, the closure lacks a clearly legible cost; the "shattering" of assumptions is presented as a frictionless gain of insight, which weakens the impact of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, successfully building a mood that shifts from stasis to purpose. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the protagonist's stance is crystallized for the journey ahead. The primary weakness is that the cost—the "latent sacrifice"—is stated rather than dramatized, making the price of the final decision feel more conceptual than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds density through the forging process and the character's reflections, leading to a clear closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) upon the apprentice's arrival. This arrival reweights the blacksmith's future, with the loss of solitude as a legible cost. The piece is well-oriented and maintains its structural integrity from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR). However, the closure is critically undermined by its refusal to specify the "secret" she uncovers. Stating she "had finally uncovered the secret she had been seeking" without providing any concrete detail renders the entire journey's payoff hollow. This is a critical failure of causality: the climactic effect has no discernible on-page cause, leaving the claimed transformation and its cost entirely abstract and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is a sequence of observations and internal shifts that build toward a resonant conclusion. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where the skipper accepts his role and the emotional cost ("the luminescent ache"), is well-earned and lands with quiet force. Causality is emotional rather than event-driven, which is appropriate for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a single ritualistic moment. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cycle is affirmed—lacks a felt cost. The "weight of her responsibility" is mentioned in a single summary line after the climax, not demonstrated or paid on the page, weakening the entire structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Kaito re-understands charisma. However, the closure lacks a legible cost. The "iridescent caution" is mentioned but never paid, undercutting the weight of the final realization; the ending is purely one of gain ("clarity," "wonder and awe") without a visible trade-off or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sextant is healed). The magical causality is internally consistent. However, the climax trigger—"At the precise moment when a pin dropped"—feels arbitrary and unearned, a cliché of magical timing rather than a result of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a single intensification. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is legible as the realm begins to heal and the keeper's hope is renewed. However, the felt cost is weak; her "never-ending" task is asserted but not grounded in any specific sacrifice or loss within the scene, softening the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a contemplative mood that leads to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure unit lands, recontextualizing the mistake and the invitation. However, the inciting discovery—a perfectly apt note falling from a book—functions as a deus ex machina, weakening the causal integrity of the resolution. The character finds the answer rather than creating it, which feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is coherent. The plot is the protagonist's internal journey, which progresses through repeated visits. The closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where she accepts the seasonal nature of her peace. The cost is the temporary, "tenuous" quality of the absolution, which is earned and felt in the "final visit of the season."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a legible Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding of her role shifts. However, the central causal link—how "sampling frequencies revealed a pattern"—is asserted rather than dramatized. This narrative leap abstracts the core discovery, weakening the sense of an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an "and then" sequence rather than a causal one. The acquisition of the fob doesn't logically precipitate the confrontation with The Shadow, though a connection is hinted at. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lacks a legible cost; the story asks "at what cost?" but fails to show one on the page, significantly weakening the ending's impact per the rubric's Cost Proof Test.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds from quiet observation to a charged climax, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria's worldview shifts. The closure lands on the page with the felt cost of losing a purely explainable world. The causal chain, while textural, is coherent: the intensifying aurora and vibrating ring logically propel Aria toward her encounter and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a simple, effective single scene culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the transformed lock and dissipated sorrow. The cost—the channeling and release of her pain—is legible. The symbolic causality of the lock's transformation works well within the story's magical-realist tone and chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, but its structure is a simple, linear summary that lacks causal tension. The plot progresses as a sequence of events ("and then this happened") rather than a series of choices and consequences that tighten the stakes. While the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, the path to it is dramatically inert, reading more like a synopsis than a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood rather than a causal chain. A closure unit exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculpture is complete, the new era is poised to begin), but it lacks any discernible on-page cost. Since the transition from words to "the language of the heart" is presented as purely positive, the stakes feel abstract and the ending lacks weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the pressure of the fire reconfigures Aria's internal state. The structure is sound for this length, with a clear setup, intensification, and closure. The final image of the reborn roses provides a Resonant Reconfiguration, and the cost is the acceptance of permanent fragmentation rather than a complete cure. The symbolic causality, where controlling the external fire controls the internal, holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot progresses through a summary montage ("She spent the next few days reading... Finally, she managed to arrange a meeting") rather than a causal chain of scenes. This "and-then" structure deflates tension. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the locket's meaning, is on-page, but the journey to it feels unearned, as the key discoveries and interactions are recounted, not dramatized, thus providing no legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a series of symbolic observations (dice, dance, spider) build toward a final shift in stance. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria decides to leave, is achieved on the page. However, the causal linkage is purely thematic and lacks narrative friction, making the progression feel more like a checklist of symbolic beats than a sequence of mounting pressure that forces a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure—a Decisive Change in knowledge—lands with felt cost. However, the narrative structure relies on a sequence of convenient, disconnected plot devices (a whale triggers a feeling, which leads to coffee grounds, which provide a map) that reads more like an "and-then" summary than a tightly woven plot where one event pressures the next.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. Orientation is established early, and the plot builds through a coherent intensification of a single magical process. The closure—releasing the origami wing—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with a felt cost of expended energy, effectively resolving the central stake. The causality is process-based rather than event-based, which fits the story's meditative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere toward a quiet but effective closure. The structure is a single, continuous scene that is well-oriented. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the student's worldview is permanently altered, lands with a clear conceptual cost (loss of mundane perception), solidified by the passing of the seal. The plot is simple, but its progression from lesson to personal breakthrough is coherent and satisfying for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The progression from discovery to resolution is logical, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of Lyra's internal state—is legible. The cost is stated ("memories, though painful") but could have been rendered with more visceral impact on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. The plot doesn't rely on causal turns but on a deliberate intensification of atmosphere and process, which builds steadily toward the closure. Orientation is handled cleanly, and the ending provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the forger achieves peace. The cost is the moral weight of her "treason," which is felt throughout, making the final stasis feel earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a singular atmosphere towards its closure. The ending achieves a Charged Poise, where Aria's quest is reconfigured with a new, deeper mystery. However, the central "discovery" is a magical epiphany ("she saw the webs...and understood") rather than a causally earned step, which softens the impact of the change in knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final shift in understanding. The closure, a Charged Poise where Aria gains purpose, is legible and lands on the page. However, the causal chain is soft; the vision is triggered by the snow globe as a convenient device rather than an earned development. While the structure works for its lens, the progression feels more asserted than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, with the physical journey mirroring the internal one. The orientation is strong and the progression is logical. However, the closure—a moment of Conceptual Repricing—is critically weakened by the absence of a legible cost. The achievement of "profound understanding" lands without the weight of a struggle, making the resolution feel frictionless and predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain from clue to discovery. The structure is sound for its length, and the ending achieves a valid Charged Poise. However, the progression relies on convenient, somewhat cliché plot devices, such as finding and perfectly reassembling shredded letters that contain all necessary information. The final cost—a shift in worldview—is legible but lacks impact due to the thin characterization preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story uses an accumulative structure, summarizing events over years, which is a valid choice. However, it fails on causality by asserting the visionary's transition from passive listener to active guide without dramatizing the decision or action that enables it. While the ending achieves a Conceptual Repricing with the portico's meaning, this closure feels weightless because it resolves a conflict that was never shown on the page, making the final state feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. It builds pressure through a sequence of evocative objects (music box, jars) that trigger reflection and deepen the character's internal state. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the poet's acceptance of his solitude is reframed as a purposeful guardianship, an Earned Stasis with a clear felt cost. Orientation is handled well, anchoring the scene from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. The plot is a single, continuous process that builds to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the artifact is safe but the character accepts the cost of perpetual vigilance. Orientation is immediate and the closure, while quiet, is earned within the story's textural framework.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the revolution begins, is achieved. However, the on-page cost is negligible; the long wait is backstory, and the future fight is off-page, weakening the closure's impact. The causal link between "tracking moon paths" and the climax of raising hands feels more magical than methodical, creating a slight disconnect.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens within a single, continuous scene. Orientation is clear, and the closure is an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's internal state shifts. However, the emotional progression feels more like a smooth, declared realization than a textural intensification that forces a change, and the "cost" of "fortified vulnerability" is stated rather than viscerally embodied, softening the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to achieve a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) at closure, which fits the word count. The structure is sound and orientation is clear. However, the causal chain leading to the chaplain's change of heart is weak; the encounter feels more like a convenient thematic vehicle than a necessary, earned progression. The cost of his past failure is felt, but the resolution on the page is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of observations toward a final insight. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Zephyr's understanding is reconfigured, lands on the page. However, the causal chain is weak, functioning as an "and then" summary of a process rather than a dramatized plot; the climactic "burst of insight" feels convenient because the intellectual struggle was not rendered with any specific obstacles or breakthroughs.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through recurring patterns, which is a valid structure. However, the closure unit is critically weakened by assertion. The story states "Lena finally uncovered the truth" and "The answer, when it came..." without dramatizing the final causal link or discovery. This summarizing of the climax makes the Conceptual Repricing feel unearned and hollows out the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the "burden of her role"—and the structure is coherent for its short length. However, the plot is a simple, linear sequence of find-and-fix, entirely lacking a meaningful tightening or complication that would make the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is simple and effective for this length: arrival, action, and internal shift, all within one continuous scene. The closure—an Earned Stasis of fragile peace—lands with a clear, felt cost: the constant awareness of endings. This makes the before/after state legible without a dramatic external change, fitting the lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, moving from a concrete inciting incident (the letter fragment) to a period of observation and culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where the sentinel redefines her role, is earned within the story's quiet logic. The structure is simple but sound, with no causal breaks or orientation failures.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a state of contemplative stillness. The structure is simple but coherent: a trigger (prophet's arrival) leads to an action (creating the clearing) which culminates in a resolution (achieving Earned Stasis). The closure lands on the page, but the felt cost—ongoing responsibility—is soft and lacks a sharp, memorable price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story establishes a clear setting and mood, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the narrative lacks any meaningful turn or deepening; it's a single, sustained state without progression. The closure feels unearned because nothing has been challenged or risked, resulting in a very low-cost, and thus low-impact, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a static, atmospheric state to a moment of decisive pressure and concluding with a resonant reconfiguration. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands perfectly on the page; the scholar's choice to testify has a clear, felt cost (loss of safety) and redefines their future. The inferred drive lens holds consistently from the oppressive quiet of the library to the determined steps in the city.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Operating under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is exemplary for this mode. The narrative builds density through a ritualistic action, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with a legible, felt cost—the consumed chalk and the fog-erased pattern—making the prophet's internal shift undeniable and satisfying the requirements for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the causal links are extremely weak, bordering on arbitrary. The earth tremors begin and end without cause, and the clock hand starts and stops for similarly unexplained reasons. This lack of internal logic makes the structure feel convenient, as if external events are merely switched on and off to provoke the character's internal monologue rather than creating a coherent plot.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building atmosphere toward a clear closure. The inciting incident (blood work results) logically leads to the climax (Emma's death). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration for Lena, landing on the page with a clear, albeit gentle, emotional cost. The structure is simple but coherent and well-executed for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story structure is Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a valid closure form—a Charged Poise where Lyra's understanding is reconfigured. However, the central turn, "Lyra finally understood," feels unearned, arriving as a sudden epiphany without a preceding, dramatized causal chain of discovery. The story summarizes her research process rather than showing the specific connections that lead to the breakthrough, weakening the causality of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, where stimuli (garden, tooth) and reflection build to a new understanding. Closure is achieved via a Resonant Reconfiguration, as Emilia's internal state shifts from unsettled to purposeful. However, the felt cost of this change is minimal; it reads more as a problem being solved than a path being foreclosed at a price, which slightly weakens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building a state of being rather than a causal plot. The structure is a single, continuous scene that successfully culminates in a form of Earned Stasis ("the star watcher's heart remained still"). The cost is the felt dedication and refinement process ("a crucible... refined... into a vessel"), which is legible, though subtle. The piece successfully executes its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a quiet climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria finds strength in shared silence, lands on the page. The cost is her acceptance of vulnerability. The structure is simple but effective for the story's length and aims, with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood towards a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's internal state. However, the closure lacks a felt cost; she overcomes her writer's block through a convenient spectral visitation with no trade-off or sacrifice. The causal link between the ghostly appearance and the creative breakthrough feels magical and simplistic, weakening the earnedness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration of the community's emotional state. However, the closure lacks a legible, on-page cost. Elara's "countless hours" of work are mentioned in backstory, but the resolution feels effortless in the present scene, weakening the sense that this profound change was truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward a successful climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the enchanted plate and the "moving stillness" of the setting mark a clear before/after state change. The cost—Aria's essence and exhaustion—is present, if somewhat abstract. The narrative is coherent and effective within its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, with a simple, clean structure. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure—fixing the device—is a satisfying on-page change that reconfigures the cavern's atmosphere, and the cost of time is legible, if soft. The final image of the ticking clock provides a strong, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building atmosphere toward a clear closure unit. The final tapestry serves as a powerful Conceptual Repricing of the story's central premise. The structure is simple but elegant for this mode, with a clear before/after state and a felt cost in the weaver's ephemeral nature. Orientation is established immediately and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the meditative act of carving. The structure is simple and effective for this mode, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at the end. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost, captured in the "small, sad smile" and the quiet acceptance of loss, making the before/after state legible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a state of being that culminates in a clear closure unit. The final act of taking the photograph serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new stasis for the character. The conceptual cost—the acceptance that the past is irretrievable—is legible and earned within the story's quiet framework.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a simple, linear structure: arrival, discovery, resolution. An Accumulative/Textural lens fits, and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causal chain is weak; the sextant "seemed to be guiding her" is a vague magical link, and the leap from seeing a maze to rerouting pipes lacks a compelling intermediate step. The cost of her effort is minimal—simply the passage of time—which weakens the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the bear's appearance serves as a catalyst for an internal shift. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elian achieves a new sense of purpose. However, the resolution feels too tidy and frictionless; the story states he finds "peace" rather than dramatizing the cost of disrupting his stable life, which weakens the impact of the before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands, and the cost is the dismantling of a false self-narrative. However, the causal link between Lyra's actions ("training her instincts") and the discovery is tenuous and magical, as admitted by the line "the very fabric of time was bending to accommodate her quest," which weakens the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. The plot is simple—a single, focused task—but the accumulation of atmospheric pressure from the fog and the internal pressure of decryption builds steadily. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (gaining the secret knowledge), which occurs on the page and resolves the central question. The cost is felt in the solitary dedication required, which fits the story's quiet tone.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, building mood effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, a critical and inexplicable causality break occurs at the climax: the narrator states the "thread snapped," but two sentences later is described as walking away with it "still clutched in my hand." This contradiction shatters the integrity of the final image and fatally undermines the story's closure, rendering an otherwise effective structure unsound.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building emotional and atmospheric density toward its climax. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the world's state and the prince's emotions shift into "a deep, abiding peace." However, the final change feels somewhat unearned, happening magically once the device is complete, softening the impact of the felt cost which was his long, emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear two-shard structure (lagoon -> scene -> lagoon) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is driven by an internal, associative logic that is consistent with this lens. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing where Aria finds her purpose, accepting her scars as part of her strength; this resonant final state is earned by the central action of grafting the tree. The structure is sound and serves the story's quiet aims well.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a clear and logical Causal lens, with each step leading directly to the next. The structure is sound for its length, and it achieves a Decisive Change at closure when the fountains are restored. However, the closure critically fails the cost-proof test; Aria achieves a total victory with no visible price paid on the page. The "newfound responsibility" is framed as a positive acceptance of a role, not a felt cost, which significantly undermines the narrative's weight for a high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) for its closure. The final image of a "universe forever changed" by the sentimentalist's vanished presence establishes a clear before/after with a felt, albeit metaphysical, cost. While the plot is a simple transit without significant turns, the structure is coherent and serves the chosen lens and resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The sequence of sensory details and memories (carving, breeze, ghost, ribbon, poem) builds pressure that leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, where "grief" is given a new shape. The closure lands on the page with a felt sense of peace, the cost being the accepted permanence of loss. However, the progression of triggers feels overly convenient, lacking the friction of a less linear discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the central turning point—finding the inscribed rake handle—functions as a deus ex machina. This plot device provides a simplistic, external solution to a complex internal problem, weakening the story's causal integrity. While the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, the contrived nature of its trigger makes the entire sequence feel unearned and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and knowledge methodically toward a clear closure. The final beat provides a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the gardener's reality is permanently altered. The cost—exchanging a finite mystery for an infinite, daunting awareness—is felt, making the ending earned and resonant under this narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens to build toward a clear moment of Charged Poise, a valid form of Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is a single, focused scene that deepens its initial premise, and the closure lands with a palpable sense of potential. The lack of causal turns is appropriate for the chosen lens, and the final image reweights the story's stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a magical event. However, the closure is weakened by assertion; the text states "she had succeeded...the dust would now begin to tell its own stories" rather than dramatizing this new reality. A tangible, on-page cost for this achievement is not legible, which softens the impact of the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from observation to dialogue, action, and final reflection. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing about the value of impermanent art, lands cleanly. The cost—the loss of the "mirage of safety"—is conceptually legible, fitting the story's meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and its structure is coherent for that mode. Orientation is clear, and the closure—a form of Earned Stasis where Kael accepts his path—is on the page with a legible cost of isolation. However, the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; it presents a static state of contemplation rather than a progression, which weakens the feeling that the final stasis was truly earned through escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, which is appropriate for its reflective nature. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Emilia's resolve is reaffirmed (Earned Stasis). However, the plot is static; the central act of playing the zither deepens her mood but doesn't constitute a significant tightening or re-evaluation of her options or the costs involved.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end, where the greenhouse is re-contextualized. However, the closure is critically undermined by a complete lack of cost. Aria achieves her goal perfectly without struggle, sacrifice, or a meaningful trade-off, which makes the transformation feel hollow and unearned. The plot is a sequence of successful actions rather than a causal chain of rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on convenience over causality, operating under a weak Accumulative/Textural lens. The maintenance worker's cryptic riddle is a contrived plot device, and the sudden discovery of a hidden log that explains everything feels unearned. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that reframes "failure" as "adaptation," lands, but the path to this realization is arbitrary and lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final Conceptual Repricing. The structure is sound and orientation is never in doubt. However, the closure, while valid in form, lacks significant weight. The cost of being "forever changed" is abstract, and the mechanics of the climactic ritual—the supposed cause of the epiphany—are too vague ("small, carefully chosen objects") to feel causally robust.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear arc of stasis-catalyst-revelation-resolution, and the closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the garden's history, is legible. However, the plot's primary turn hinges on the coincidental arrival of the ampoule, a 'deus ex machina' that delivers an unearned revelation. This contrivance significantly weakens the story's causal integrity, making the statue a passive recipient of insight rather than an agent who earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection rather than causal plot turns. The structure is simple but effective for its purpose. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the protagonist accepts their fate, with the cost being freedom, which is legible in the final lines. The piece is well-oriented and its logic is internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, a shift to renewed purpose, lands cleanly on the page. The "cost" is the "weight of her task," which is legible but lacks visceral impact. The structure is simple and effective for its length, with clear orientation and a coherent flow from reflection to action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of discoveries that leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the central inciting incident—the ice thawing at the precise moment of the tour—is a significant coincidence that weakens the narrative's causal integrity. While the structure serves the lens, its reliance on convenience over earned revelation is a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal drive lens from start to finish. The plot is well-structured for its length, with each beat logically following the last. Closure is achieved on the page as a Decisive Change leading to a Charged Poise, where the character is transformed and faces a new future. The cost is slightly abstract ("never be the same"), but the final image gives it sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative structure, but its causality is severely damaged by the late, unsupported introduction of "The resuscitation." This detail appears without any setup and fails to alter subsequent choices, reading as a jarring piece of unearned backstory that breaks the established narrative frame. While the final Conceptual Repricing lands, this moment of plot amnesia significantly weakens the story's logical integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. It is well-oriented, establishing a clear who, where, and when. The structure is a simple, elegant arc: observation, creation, and lingering resonance. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the music's completion charges the atmosphere, with the cost being the prophet's exertion ("chest heaving") and the art's ephemerality. This lands cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under a Hybrid (Causal-to-Accumulative) lens. The plot progresses logically from discovery to decision. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, crystallizing Lyra's stance against the unknown with a palpable felt cost—the "weight of the unknown" and "oppressive force" of the watchers. The transition from the city to the wilderness marks a clear, meaningful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the closure is critically flawed by a lack of cost. The Decisive Change (success) is achieved without any demonstrated struggle, sacrifice, or meaningful trade-off; the phrase "the task was not an easy one" is asserted but unsupported by the narrative. This failure to meet the Cost Proof Test makes the resolution feel unearned and hollow, undermining the entire structure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that leads to a clear closure. The ending, where the surveyor departs after completing their work, is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the conceptual cost feels muted and the plot is a simple sequence of observations rather than a chain of events that meaningfully tightens or deepens the surveyor's options.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is sound for this mode: a problem is introduced (the code), a deepening occurs (the need for an "alternative hypothesis"), and it culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's purpose is crystallized. The closure lands with a felt, if subtle, cost—her transformation. The progression is logical and serves the quiet, internal nature of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight through recurring images toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The release of the crane and the internal sense of grief "unfolding" provides a legible before/after shift with a felt cost. The structure is elegant and well-suited to the story's contemplative nature, landing its closure with quiet confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, but the links are conceptually weak and rely on convenience. The leap from finding a geode to seeking refuge in a specific scientific observatory is inadequately motivated. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands clearly by establishing a new mission, but it's built on a foundation of plot contrivances that weaken its overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical Causal lens for the external plot: the drone finds a signal, the signal leads to a map, the map leads to the chip. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's entire quest—lacks a visible or felt cost. The internal realization is not causally linked to the preceding actions and arrives as a neat, unearned reward, weakening the structure's overall integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where atmospheric pressure and symbolic resonance build toward a clear closure. The ending is a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the protagonist's shift to action is decisive and the felt cost ("tempered regret") is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmosphere until the negotiator's speech provides a final reweighting. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands cleanly as the conflict is reframed as a path to wisdom, with the cost being the acknowledged weight of the past. While the plot is minimal, the structure is sound for its length and lens, and orientation is established immediately and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, an internal shift toward hope, is achieved on the page. The felt cost is legible in Jack's continued possession of the broken compass, symbolizing his acceptance of his past. The plot itself is slight, serving as a vehicle for the central metaphor, but it is structurally sound for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The structure is simple and effective for the length: arrival, discovery, commitment. The closure, where Lena accepts the journey and the path forward is illuminated, lands with a felt cost of entering the unknown, foreclosing the option of turning back. The causality relies on the opportune discovery of the baseball, which is acceptable for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra's identity expands—lands cleanly on the page. The structure is sound for this length. However, the sense of cost is muted by the immediate, positive reframing of the transformation, and Lyra's foreknowledge of her metamorphosis ("for she knew that she was on the cusp") feels like an unearned plot convenience that lessens the dramatic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where a sequence of images and memories builds to a final insight. The structure is a single, continuous scene with excellent orientation. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cartomancer's understanding shifts to acceptance; the felt cost is the acknowledgment of irretrievable time, making the ending resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building emotional weight toward a clear closure moment. The structure is simple but coherent: Aurora performs a ritual (stitching) which culminates in the dimension opening. The final image provides a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ship's purpose, and the emotional cost ("sadness, joy") is legible, fulfilling the core requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot structure is coherent. The sequence builds atmospheric pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Aria's worldview is reconfigured. The cost—losing her perception of a random universe for a fated one—is legible. However, the causality is weak even for this lens; events happen *to* her in a simple sequence rather than accumulating in a way that forces a difficult stance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain (Causal Lens), from the inciting blackout to the closing revolutionary act. The structure is sound for its length, and orientation is handled well. However, the closure, a Decisive Change, feels unearned because the pivotal action—activating the cradle—lacks any meaningful on-page obstacle or cost, making the resolution feel convenient rather than won. The stated future risk is not a substitute for a price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot is well-structured. It moves from setup (finding the stardust) through the ritualistic action to a clear climax (the vision). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, revealing the universe's secrets. The cost is the lifting of a burden ("unfulfilled prophecies"), which marks a clear before/after state, fulfilling the requirements for this story length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is clean: a single scene builds atmospheric and psychological pressure, leading to a single decisive action (opening the letter) and a clear closure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of her past trauma, lands on the page with a felt cost of confronting painful truths, resulting in an earned state of peace. The before/after is legible and satisfying within the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal structure (Lens: Causal), and the closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the meaning of victory is re-evaluated. However, the cost of the duel is minimized and tidily resolved by the final epiphany. The physical and mental price isn't felt on the page, which weakens the impact of the final change, making it feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building from reflection to a decisive action. The structure is clean and effective for the length, passing the Orientation Test easily. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet begins the work, and the final image of dawn reweights the library's meaning from decay to hope, landing with a felt cost in the final line's "mix of sadness and hope."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure through a sequence of evocative images. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the pianist returns to the same physical space, but her internal stance toward the static past (the clock) and open future (the compasses) is decisively changed. The cost is leaving the peaceful refuge, which feels appropriately scaled for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure progresses logically from setup to a clear closure unit. The ending, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), feels earned by the preceding accumulation of effort and atmosphere. The stakes are established, and the resolution provides a satisfying, if quiet, cadence where Aria's work is complete for the season.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is sound: an inciting incident (finding the compass) leads to a symbolic climax (weaving and releasing the lace-wrapped object). The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page with a tangible act, and the cost is legible—the regret remains but is transformed. The narrative progression is coherent and serves the internal arc effectively.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern-building reflections, but lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; closure via conceptual repricing in the final realization of peace offers a subtle reconfiguration with oblique cost, yet orientation is anchored early without disorientation payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards in one canyon scene, with orientation anchored early in the luminous glass artist's position on the floor. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the dawn smile, reweighting her purpose with conceptual cost from the scorched testament, but lacks a decisive pattern break or density increase to make the before/after fully legible. The ledger unrolling provides one meaningful deepening, yet the overall linkage feels elliptical without motivated pressure advancing knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned emotional and vibrational layers toward a resonant reconfiguration in the "symphony of silence," with conceptual repricing of stillness as music carrying undeniable cost of the catastrophe's aftermath. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with charged poise as she carries the music outward, reweighting options, though causality feels more textural than tightly linked, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages from package arrival to descent and reactivation, culminating in an Earned Stasis closure where the undertaker remains as guardian with felt cost of his transformed life. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early, with one major transition to the underwater library handled legibly in a two-shard scope. Minor redundancy in reflective pondering slightly flattens causality without breaking the lens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)

    The accumulative/textural lens holds with building insights, but causality is loose, relying on summary montages without motivated ellipsis or clear before/after shifts. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early, but time jumps (night to dawn to days) lack legible transitions, slightly disorienting without serving closure. Closure is a conceptual repricing via the key's metaphor, with felt excitement/trepidation as cost, but it feels more declarative than reconfiguration with undeniable pressure. No meaningful tightening under the lens, as connections accumulate without a decisive pattern break or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Charged Poise closure where Emilia gains clarity, with conceptual cost in the tension between nostalgia and innovation; however, causality is loose with unanchored backstory like "events that had transpired after the substitute body was found," creating orientation debt past 120 words without payoff at ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective deepening and cadence shifts, with orientation anchored early in the grotto setting.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse becomes a laboratory of humility, the cost a permanent epistemic limit. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns reweight meaning—held cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger, frost, and scorched testament converge to reconfigure her purpose. However, the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening beat (ledger → frost pattern) is elegant but under-motivated; causality is lyrical rather than driven by choice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (frost, hum, sunrise light) thickens until the silent “symphony” crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the music now carried inside her—yet the felt cost is more conceptual than tangible. Orientation is swift and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker stays, the signal becomes an invitation, and the cost is the life he gives to guardianship. Causality is causal-lite; the package triggers action, but the underwater sequence is delivered as montage rather than scene, blurring because/therefore links. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causality holds—the bell and donations drive every beat—but closure is soft: the final chime restates solidarity rather than reconfiguring it, so lens (Accumulative) lands without a clear after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aria’s stance reconfigures, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of breath and blossom—not causal. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality break, yet the pilgrim’s exit feels like convenient fade.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“weave its secrets into their next hedge maze design”) but the cost is only gestured at. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is diffuse—no single image crystallizes the reconfiguration with felt price.

    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the liberator slips away while fields flourish, implying success without on-page cost. Causality is present—decoding keys → locating vault → distributing seeds—but the vault infiltration is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the decisive change. The arrow signal is introduced late and never loops back to alter tactics, leaving the ending legible but low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (colors-as-sound, forge whispers, aurora shifts) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—device hums alive, cost is the crystalline shatter felt in her chest—though the causal jump from “absences collected” to “sound captured” is lightly elliptical.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure delivers a conceptual re-pricing: Lumina’s photograph re-shapes existence, but the cost is only asserted (“thrill of luminous disbelief”), not embodied or dramatized on the page; the drive is accu-thematic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb glows, reconfiguring Elian’s stance from isolation to vocation. Yet the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is only implicit; the causality between “abandon” and the orb’s glow is asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—protagonist exits library with new resolve—but the lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and Causal without firm linkage. The “truth is in the shadows” reweights earlier material, yet the causal chain from seashell to stance change is thin. Orientation is clear early; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world “rearranged into a new and mysterious pattern”), but the causal chain is weak: the act of “summarizing the silence” is never grounded in rules or stakes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence deepens, yet the felt cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the ice violin glows as Zeta reweights its own origin story, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of loops and twilight deepening reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One transition (loop shards) is handled cleanly. No causality break, though the final beat is more tableau than decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens reconfigures perception and signals a stance crystallization. However, the causal chain is thin; the doodles’ meaning is asserted rather than dramatized, and the “before/after” shift is more conceptual than experiential. The lens’s payoff is legible, but the cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the dresser smiles at the garden’s “knowledge,” a resonant reconfiguration. Yet the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening (garden’s measurable luck) is introduced late; earlier beats lack causal linkage. Orientation is clear, but the pattern of escalating care is more stated than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—time does move sideways—yet the cost is only “tingling” hands; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early, but the sideways jump feels more scenic than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of lanterns flickering while the water “echoes the music” crystallizes a new, wordless understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each water-formed image layers density until the program’s message reweights the stake. Causality is soft but coherent under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the truth is fluid, the station a crucible, the cost the acceptance of impermanence—felt in the “auroral sorrow.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift (logbook palimpsest → vanishing charcoal) reweight meaning. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the swallowed truth is named but never dramatized as a discrete before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a soft “sense of satisfaction” rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the swallowed truth remains abstract and the beaded wheel does not reweight meaning. Causality is loose—turning the valve and listening to radio calls do not tighten options or raise cost. Orientation is adequate, but the lens never resolves into clear Causal or Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a lyric reprise (Earned Stasis) that reweights the premise: the keeper “remained” in regenerative silence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but causality is loose—burrowing is more mood than decisive act—so cost feels diffuse rather than sharply paid.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the eclipse pattern builds atmospheric pressure whose final crystallization counts as Earned Stasis under poetic logic. No single beat creates reversal; instead, tonal density gathers until the closing chord reweights the moment. Closure is legible and feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Emilia exits with “bronze quiet” inside her, reconfiguring her stance toward the silo. However, the causal chain is thin—no visible forfeiture or new constraint arises from the tapestry or diaries; the cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft conceptual repricing—“life transposed into a new key”—but the causal chain is diffuse; the microdot specs never alter tactics on the page. Orientation is adequate; single-scene default met. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence after sound reweights reality, and the dimensional anchor stills. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sonic layers and silence that intensifies to a cadence shift. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of spectacle for silence, though it could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn light thickens, mirrored horizon intensifies, map folds shut—each beat reweights the stake of creative retrieval. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrored world reconfigures meaning, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative pattern taught early (retracing → labyrinth → transformation); closure image reweights meaning via “ brightness darkening.” Lacks visible material cost, relying instead on tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: seasons rustle, hush thickens, numbness recedes. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a new melody began to take shape”—that reweights the premise with felt cost (the silence she now inhabits). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. However, the tightening is diffuse; the story circles rather than narrows, so the cost is atmospheric rather than sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands resolved with tube in hand—yet the cost is implied rather than visible. Causal chain (message → deduction → decision) is coherent under a Causal lens; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the UV reveal deepens pattern and cadence, culminating in a Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by ~90 words. However, the decisive reconfiguration (“the greenhouse had become a catalyst for her own transformation”) is asserted rather than dramatized, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning stones builds texture until dawn image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise, but cost is conceptual rather than felt—no option is foreclosed on the page. Orientation clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is “tempered” by communal music, a felt shift. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of image and cadence rather than because/therefore—yet the lens holds. Cost is diffuse (shared silence) rather than personal and specific to the violinist, slightly blunting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the amber grotto’s glow thickens like honey, reweighting the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the grotto seemed to whisper its approval”—but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt by the dealer, so the beat lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft “let’s do good” plan rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the cost is deferred. Causal chain hinges on two serendipities—locket and misdelivered envelope—yet neither tightens options nor extracts price. Orientation is clear, but lens drifts from situational to sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—community embrace—but the causal chain is thin: the arbor’s presentation is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is only asserted. The search for the tag supplies a single beat of shared action yet resolves the isolation arc too easily. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds but lacks tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene structure is clean; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by the second sentence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her perception is permanently altered—yet the causal link between “uncaging infinity” and the sketchbook filling itself is more lyrical than legible. The giant’s stirring supplies a faint tremor of cost, satisfying the cost test, but the mechanism of borrowing time remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the moonlit hush yields a resonant reconfiguration—the orchard’s silence becomes possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “a buried optimism stirring” reweights the stake with felt cost (the unrecoverable loss accepted). Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the final image of the dweller “hidden in plain sight” with a “beacon” heart—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern (storm → reflection → resolve) is not taught early enough to feel intentional; closure arrives as a summary statement rather than a charged image. The decisive change (“she would begin her journey”) is off-page, so the cost is conceptual only. Orientation is clear, yet the causality between storm, leaf, and metamorphosis remains associative rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the brooch becomes the painting “Convergence,” reweighting the island’s meaning. Causality is loose—rain-trail code and stranger exposition feel like convenient reveals rather than because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Aria re-weights her clairvoyance toward “everyday magic.” However, the pilgrim’s arrival and pearl’s effect feel like unmotivated gifts rather than earned turns; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final deepening lacks a visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—harbor reborn, exile receding—yet the decisive change is summarized rather than dramatized. Causal chain from valve purchase to community healing is telescoped; pressure flattens. Orientation clear; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Closure cost is felt but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a declared epiphany rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost is extracted from Emilia. The Accumulative/Textural lens is signaled by pattern and cadence, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than crystallizes. Orientation is clear early, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise—Emilia leaves with “newfound appreciation”—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Causality is loose: the tile’s patterns unlock memories off-stage, and the whale-song link is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens tilts Accumulative without a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Narrative tracks a causal arc: boredom → discovery → ritual → emergence. Closure satisfies Resonant Reconfiguration: the doubled Kael reweights “after goodbye” from terror to continuity, with spatial mutiny as Charged Poise. Occasional drifting abstracts—storm “subside” rather than residual energy cost—mutes the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a single, coherent scene and uses a Causal lens: father negotiates → director hesitates → breach proposed. Closure is a Charged Poise (“she would be ready…”), but the cost is only implied; a more palpable forfeiture would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the final “kaleidoscope of sensations” reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise, but the cost is only implied—she walks away satisfied—so the reconfiguration lacks a felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—the survivor’s layered narrative crystallizes erased histories with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and held. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is a declared epiphany (“she knew that she had unlocked the secrets”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained, but the ending summarizes rather than reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is Earned Stasis—residents ready to resist—but the shift from carnival joy to militant unity is summarized, not staged. Causal linkage between graffiti and mobilization is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last photograph of the hourglass grain reweights the entire mission into a memorial act. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the dawn light crystallizes the stakes. The persistent constraint (self-destructing message) shapes tactics, and the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s steady hover crystallizes the new harmony and carries felt cost in the fading mist. Causal chain is light—more Accumulative/Textural—but the lens holds and the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a prospective Decisive Change—she steps onto the ice—but the cost is still ahead, not yet felt. Causal chain is thin: condensation pattern → decipher → walk; no intermediate obstacle or trade-off. Orientation is clear early; no disorientation taught. Lens reads Causal, but escalation is one-step, lacking tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—the town’s “sound of a town reborn” reconfigures meaning—but the cost is only implied, not legible on the page. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds yet lacks a felt forfeiture at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple’s silence after energy harvest reweights Kael’s solitude with palpable loss. Causal chain holds (perfume guides → energy freed → memory preserved), though the “unsnarl” mechanics remain abstract. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    Closure is missing: the piece ends on atmospheric suspension rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught, but the promised tightening never arrives; the labyrinth remains unthreaded and stakes unaltered. Orientation is adequate, yet the absence of a culminating beat breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft fade-out (“presence dissipated”) rather than a decisive change or charged poise; the debt is declared repaid but no on-page cost is felt. Causality is loose: the bead unlocks awakening off-stage, and the ghost’s guidance is asserted rather than shown. Orientation is clear, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern does not tighten meaningfully at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise (glowing tapestry, canyon bathed in light), but the cost is asserted rather than shown. Orientation is clear early, yet causality is weak: the fabric glows “of its own accord,” so the turn lacks agency. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern intensifies but never tightens options or reveals a price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Maya surveys the tomb and feels “cautious enchantment”—but the cost is diffuse and off-stage; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight stakes or foreclose a path. Orientation is clear, but causality is loose: excavation proceeds without obstacle or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the sealed letter pulses with “energy all its own,” reweighting the premise of slow communication. However, the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than causal; the tightening is a cadence shift, not a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early; no causality break, but cost is poetic rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed chart “vibrates with an otherworldly energy” and the embroiderer knows their work is “only just beginning.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a lyric mood-shift rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the “weight lifting” is asserted, not shown. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and rising spirit song—but the final image does not reweight the premise with felt cost. Orientation is adequate by 120 words, yet causality between shard, window, and apparition remains fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single continuous mist-clad scene holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; closure is Earned Stasis as Kael yields to anesthetic, leaving coral in hand "pulse of soft light"—felt cost legible. Cause/effect chain is intact: cast decryption → shared anxiety surfaced → renunciation → acceptance. Orientation anchors early; only minor time dilation under anesthesia, within tolerance. Closure stands.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural glows, the orchard seems reborn, and Lena walks away with “wonder and peace” that reweights her earlier emptiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image crystallizes the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the irreversible surrender of the art to decay.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living mural crystallizes Lena’s shift from certainty to curiosity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—sound loops re-paint pigment—but the cost is atmospheric rather than sharply staked; a clearer forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft thematic summary rather than a decisive change: the greenhouse “remains a sanctuary” and seeds “carry the message forward.” No on-page cost or reconfiguration; the stakes plateau. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely reiterates rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lullaby crystallizes her stance, and the postcard’s image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“blossom armistice” now internalized). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence tighten toward the final image. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. However, the centuries-long frame is summary, not dramatized pressure, so the cost is more elegiac than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing orchids and lingering chime crystallize the caretaker’s endless task with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the “symphonies of truth” shimmer and she steps out, but the cost is asserted (“silence…begin to dissipate”) rather than shown. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern, rhythm, and glow accumulate—but the decisive reconfiguration is under-energized. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the mentor-gift ink well is introduced late and never constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single scene, single POV, orientation clear by 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kaelin’s resolve crystallizes—but the cost is only asserted (“weight of her task”), not dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of breathing stones and dappled light tightens mood, yet no causal turn narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of dust motes and departing pigeon crystallizes Emilia’s earned poise, the cost being her acceptance of an unverifiable past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dust, paper, birds layers toward this charged stillness. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    Closure is present—reunion reconfigures emotional stakes—but the Decisive Change hinges on the logbook code and father’s wave, neither force having causal traction in earlier beats. Accumulative/Textural lens holds pattern; cost is felt, yet unmotivated: why now? This lack of narrowing pressure caps it.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft epiphany—glow “emanated from within”—with no decisive change or reconfiguration; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is muted and the cost is only implied. Orientation is adequate, yet the plot beats are repetitive walks through corridors rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive is Accumulative/Textural: pattern and texture re-encode a missing path; closure re-weights memory and world as fluid, with the cost legible in the humming stone now “a part of the cave”; one minor orientation wobble early (who recollectionist is never named), but the payoff waives the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “set-up / perform / reset” repeats without tightening or deepening; closure is celebratory stasis, not a reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clear, causality within acts is smooth, but no single beat narrows future options or reweights premise. The final image reprises stars and arcade hum at same emotional register as opening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dance layers density until the verse “etches on her skin,” a Charged Poise that reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than stepwise, coherent under the chosen lens. Closure lands on the page with visible transformation and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single continuous scene, orientation anchored early. Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—she turns away having accepted her task—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of reflection holds, yet tightening is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael resolves to become “a messenger,” reweighting his identity. However, the causal chain is thin—no single beat shows the box or memory forcing that decision; it’s delivered by summary. Orientation is clear early, but the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, and the tightening beat is more cadence than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vision reweights the gauge and patterns, but the cost is only asserted (“she knew”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the deepening pattern suffices, yet the lack of felt price keeps it shy of 7.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.7)
    Closure is a soft thematic summary rather than a decisive change; the cartographer simply keeps mapping. Causal linkage between film, diaries, and final stance is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors clear, the painting glows, possibilities open. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift is legible. However, the cost is only implied (“she had succeeded”) rather than felt on the page, keeping it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise—hope asserted while Elian stands alone—but the cost is abstract (“price of redemption had been worth paying”) rather than dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of celestial imagery reweights mood, yet no causal tightening narrows options. Orientation is clear; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: intensifying sonic detail (thunder rising, water roar) tightens urgency and culminates in a Charged Poise—she stands amid the renewed flat holding the egg, renouncing the next move. Orientation is crisp and the on-page reconfiguration carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s glow marks a decisive shift from conformity to self-chosen purpose. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; each thread-untangling beat intensifies the prism’s charge. Orientation is swift; setting and POV are anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual—loss of old identity—rather than tangible, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    A single continuous scene in the dome with clear anchors. Causality is loose: the plan reverses structure, yet the reversal itself is deferred offstage; closure is a future promise rather than a tangible before/after reweighting on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical layering of image and cadence. Closure is a Charged Poise—the grotto left “in suspended animation”—but the cost to Aria is only implied, not felt on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks, yet the ending’s price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (aurora hiss, candle glow, rope vibration) intensifies until the final hum reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sanctum becomes “threshold to a new understanding”—with conceptual cost (she will carry this solitude). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: Hindsight accepts the chosen path with “solace and purpose,” a resonant reconfiguration. Yet the causal chain is thin—dreams grant knowledge without visible trade-off, and the decaying directive never tightens options on the page. Orientation is clear; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant crystallizes in the charged poise of the astronomer holding the tile aloft while the palace holds its breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical return of “dusky harmony” thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the irreversible fusion of mortal and cosmic, though the beat is slightly diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as a soft CR—harmony restored via melody—but the causal chain is vague: how cellular memory converts resentment to peace is asserted, not shown. Orientation holds, yet the drive lens slips between situational pressure and accumulative texture without tightening. No persistent constraint or price shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror becomes a doorway, boundaries erased. Causal chain is soft—breathing sync feels like magic rather than earned mechanics—but the final image reweights premise. Cost is conceptual (self-erasure) yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s thriving and Aria’s return reconfigure the meaning of the vows without resolving them tidily. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat adds density until the final image—but the causal hinge (why these seeds now?) is soft, kept from 8+ by that unmotivated timing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—knowledge reframed—yet the cost is more asserted (“never see the world the same”) than dramatized; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a concept-pricing beat (“the weight… slowly lifting”) delivered abstractly, not dramatized on the page—no definitive trade-off is shown. Cause-effect chains rely on convenient gaps (“researching gaps in pursuers’ knowledge”) left summary-level; props and spatial logic wobble under pressure. Orientation remains loose past 120 words without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra reaches the Garden and redefines it as “a state of mind”—but the shift is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is soft, more mood than irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.7)
    The closure image (rope pattern revealed) is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is abstract and off-stage; no visible forfeiture or stance crystallization occurs. Causality is loose: the rope reconfiguration is described as unlocking truth, yet the mechanism by which this alters Emilia’s options is asserted rather than shown. The “door shouldn’t exist” beat is introduced late and never integrated into the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene; orientation anchors within 120 words. Causal linkage holds: because she studies cracks → infers resonance → conjures bloom of hush → energy beings adjust. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the caves settle into “hammered repose” with felt cost—her ongoing vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orrery flares, rekindling knowledge, with a felt cost in the custodian’s awed stance. Causal linkage is thin—why the shard activates the orrery now is unexplained—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of memory immersion tightens via crystal contact. Closure is a Charged Poise (“guardian of the collective memory”) with conceptual cost, yet the causality between conjecture and crystallized stance is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/T extural lens holds; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is legible—mood shift from “weight of hopelessness” to crystallized optimism—but causality leans on serendipity rather than tightening choice; cost is softly atmospheric, not pinned to a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accurately signals Accumulative/Textural lens; each still-moment stanza deepens texture of transition. Closure (Charged Poise as dawn light arrives) reconfigures meaning with felt stillness, but lacked earlier causal linkage between chronicler’s insight and direct consequence for the two figures—stakes remain largely observational rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a gentle Charged Poise—Eli’s world “stretches” with visible emotional cost—yet the Accumulative/Textural lens is only loosely taught; the hour of inversion is more atmospheric than causally tightened, and the porcelain doll’s payoff is soft rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silence vs. sound deepens through repeated drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—the terrace bathed in hush—yet the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vial stills, but the operator’s stake never narrows.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is linear and coherent: ruby flake → murals → stairway → throne. Closure is a Decisive Change (throne claimed), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—“she would forever be bound” is summary, not felt. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper steps through the revitalized threshold, accepting the cost of leaving isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each descent beat thickens the shadows until the final cadence shift. The only drag is a brief orientation wobble at the start; who/where is clear by line 3, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (diamond rain reweights the quantum promise), but the cost is diffuse—no concrete forfeiture or new constraint is legible on the page. Causal linkage between glitchy texts, bolt, and pressure breakthrough is asserted rather than dramatized; the bolt never functions as a key. Orientation is clear; scope fits single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist leaves the room “ready to face the challenges that lay ahead,” a Charged Poise that reweights the premise. Yet the causal chain is thin; the crank handle’s mystical causality is asserted rather than earned, and the cost is only implied (“they would never be the same”).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the knight becomes conduit and vessel, merging with the shimmering entity. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each repetition of “reality shifted” deepens the cadence until the greenhouse erupts in golden light. Cost is implied but not sharply felt on the page; the allegiance chant never exacts a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Emilia’s stance crystallizes into purpose—but the cost is only implied (“broken heart slowly mending”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final tightening lacks a tangible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: Aria disperses the rebels and walks into dawn still clutching the key, a resonant image but without a legible new constraint or forfeiture. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: beats layer mood and symbol rather than tighten options. The map-by-puddle and key are set up early and return at the end, satisfying pattern coherence, yet the ending does not foreclose a path or exact a price we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph layers sensory echo until the mist clears and the music “lingers.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the grotto glows and the prophecy is “laid to rest”—but the cost is only asserted, not felt. Orientation is immediate; no causality break, yet the stakes remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of leaves, monuments, and glowing dust builds toward a single Resonant Reconfiguration in the final monument-illuminated prophecy. Closure lands on the page with cost—transformation is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian’s new “tool that would allow him to navigate” crystallizes his stance toward uncertainty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence reweight meaning—and the cost is the acceptance of perpetual uncertainty itself, legible in the final image of the path “uncertain, yet somehow, uncertainly certain.”

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes into quiet acceptance—but the cost is more asserted (“luminous regret”) than dramatized. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflective block layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor scaffold: the phrase “rain-washed” recurs enough to feel looped.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman’s spirit dissipates with a “sense of satisfaction.” Yet the causal chain is thin—no escalating obstacle or cost is dramatized; the collector simply listens and hums. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence shift lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft CR (“ultraviolet penance lifting”) announced rather than dramatized; no on-page sentence shows the cost or reconfiguration of options. Causal chain is loose: because she walks into the forest, therefore insight occurs off-stage. Orientation is clear early, but the lens drifts from causal to situational without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise (“eternal instant”) that reweights the premise, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is only implied; the causality between touching the lens fragment and the final resolve is more atmospheric than sequential, so the tightening is felt but not sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust > logbook > ghosts > mainspring recharging final image. A single deepening suffices: the barrel revealed as “key” narrows Ezra’s stance and legibly closes before/after. Cost feels in the hush before city-noise returns, though lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“eternity is a moment’s depth”—but the causal chain is thin: the whisper is released, prints are made, and the library “seems” transformed. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern intensification is asserted rather than shown through a decisive beat. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard becomes talisman, the revolutionary becomes chronicler. Causal chain is lyric/accumulative; each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes the shift. Cost is felt in “burnished sorrow” and acceptance of permanent exile. Orientation anchors early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystalline note reconfigures silence into song with felt conceptual cost (light reclaimed from midnight). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of resonance intensifies until final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. One tightening beat suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of becoming “one with the lagoon” reconfigures meaning and carries conceptual cost. Yet the causal chain is thin—visions from psychometry lead her here, but the leap from “following symbols” to ontological merger is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is clear early; no lens contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: slide → inspiration → sculpture synthesis culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration as the storm subsides, making “timewoven alliances” feel newly charged. The only cost is an internal artistic one (time and stance), but it lands quietly and satisfyingly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Track A single-scene accumulation hangs together. Orientation is sound at 60–70 words; no orientation debt. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: moonlight and cathedral glass re-weight Luna’s perception, a quiet Charged Poise. Yet the “cost” remains conceptual; nothing is given up or narrowed on the page. Causality works via accretion, but the decisive beat lacks a wound the reader can point to, keeping it below 8.8+ excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The diary discovery is the inciting spark, yet its decryption is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the causal link. Closure is a lyrical reprise (“she would return…until the secrets were fully revealed”)—a Charged Poise—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds, but the lens tilts toward Accumulative/Textural without a decisive tightening. The ending’s promise of return forecloses nothing now.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a declared Conceptual Repricing (“after the last wish is granted that true creation begins”), but the causal bridge from memory-reconstruction to physical revival is elided; we leap from vision to flourishing town without on-page mechanics. Orientation is clear early; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden “holding its breath” reweights earlier motifs, but the cost is diffuse rather than legible on the page. Causality is accumulative/textural; the prophecy’s emergence feels atmospheric rather than driven by specific beats. Orientation is clear, yet the final image lacks a concrete price tied to the scribe’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cap’s true key is sharing, not possessing. Yet the causal chain is thin—no prior beat sets up “passing it down” as a live dilemma. Orientation is clear; one continuous scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Ember’s stance crystallizes around listening rather than warning—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the bell’s resonance reweights the sanctuary’s soundscape. The cost is implied (she no longer tends the sirens), but the story could have pressed the price harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sweeping, noticing, meditative resonance. Yet no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the closure merely restates the premise that “strength lies in vulnerability” without a new cost or altered stance. Orientation is clear, but causality stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of sensory memory increases until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the box’s glow reconfigures the recluse’s guardianship with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the capsule’s repair crystallizes understanding—but the causal linkage between garage-sale messages and the decisive insight is asserted rather than dramatized, blurring the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mist, feather, kite, footprints layers toward a Charged Poise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the world “reborn”—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no constraint or price is legible on the page. Orientation is clear early. One transition (mist lifting) is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—acceptance of death—but the causal chain between architectural secrets → copper wiring → interspecies harmony is asserted rather than dramatized. The six-month deadline is named yet never narrows options on the page. Transitions are smooth, yet the drive lens stays Accumulative/Textural without a decisive tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the converging gaze with the entity reconfigures meaning and carries felt anticipation. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the dust-footprint motif is introduced late and never constrains tactics, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: coachman finishes seeding and drives away, land “reborn.” Closure beat lands on page, cost is conceptual (“garden reclaiming battlefield”) and felt. Lens = Accumulative/Textural—repeating floral motifs gather force. One static scene: no causal tightening, no rising pressure, only pattern intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single continuous scene, 600-800 words, closure achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration—final spring-side tableau crystallizes meaning and shared purpose; causality is gentle Accumulative/Textural, held intact without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass rose’s glow reweights the stake, aligning “true north” with the flickering light to crystallize Aria’s new stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery and cadence shift accumulate until the final image reconfigures possibility with felt cost (“trepidation and excitement”).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a tidy success: swap pieces, sky heals, no felt price. Causal chain is linear and unthreatened; no tightening or option foreclosure. Orientation is clear early. Drive lens is Causal but the final beat lacks cost, so closure is legible yet lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trio poised on the threshold reconfigures the void into possibility. Causality is loose—why the historian arrives now is unexplained—yet the final image satisfies the lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words; whispering gallery anchors space.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bookstore becomes “a threshold to new possibilities.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift in the final paragraph reweight the stake. Cost is implied (a world “after remembering becomes painful”) but not felt on the page; this caps the score below 8. Orientation is clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth exit crystallizes a new stance of self-forgiveness with visible cost—the village’s thaw confirms the change. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal, but the lens holds cleanly to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the mist parts to reveal etched symbols—yet the cost is only vaguely “terrible/beautiful,” not legible on the page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of refracting poetry tightens once, but causality between poem and spire revelation remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s decoded pattern crystallizes meaning while the breathless cost is felt. Causal chain holds—pockmarks → parchment match → revelation—but the workshop’s sway and acid sea remain ornamental rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final canvas crystallizes the stake of “temporary eternity” with felt cost. Causality is loose—wrong turn into oasis feels coincidental—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern of painted moments.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn image reweights the premise that “whispers travel farther.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the garden scent and vial cork accumulate resonance until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—acceptance at dawn—yet the causal chain from midnight calls to that moment is asserted rather than shown; orientation is clear, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is only loosely taught.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forager’s vanishing into rain crystallizes the cost of balancing rationality and emotion. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of storm, orchard, and eye reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.3)
    Closure lands on image (Kael holding flower) but the decisive change is asserted, not dramatized: “he knew that he would have to investigate.” The lack of visible cost reads as ellipsis rather than Resonant Reconfiguration. Accumulative/textural lens chosen; escalation relies on repeated atmospheric swirls rather than narrowing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern chamber and note reframe the promise as ongoing legacy, with conceptual cost (she must now curate, not merely decode). Causal chain holds—chip → ants → map → note—but the creek’s rising threat never physically constrains the final choice, muting the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the queen steps into the grotto, reconfiguring her stance with “no return.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—bleeding starlight intensifies pattern rather than forcing choice. Orientation is clear early, but the final beat states rather than dramatizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the shell’s “density of presence” is newly legible. Yet the causal chain is thin—no obstacle, reversal, or visible cost. The whispered phrase arrives late and functions as thematic cue rather than plot pivot. Orientation is clear, but the lens stays Accumulative/Textural without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll glows, stance crystallizes, path foreclosed by commitment to imagination. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-images intensifies until meaning reweights. Orientation clear by line 3. Causality between seeing grave and chronicling dreams is implied, not dramatized, keeping score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she leaves the shop resolved to keep “reading between the lines,” now re-weighted by the screw’s imagined histories. Causality is accumulative/textural: the fog, clocks, and screw layer into a final charged poise. However, the story never risks a decisive change or forfeiture; the cost is purely conceptual, blunting high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass intensifies the hush into a saturated final image. Closure via ‘Charged Poise’ crystallizes when sunset erupts after the written breath; the smaller tremor beats culminate in a visible, felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, perfume hum, rustling scores) tightens the emotional pitch until the final hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lyra leaves with “the weight…begin to lift,” a felt reconfiguration—but the orchard’s fate is told, not dramatized, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the universe’s hiccup resolves into “harmony and balance,” with Aria’s stance crystallized. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of inward/outward steps reweights stakes. Orientation is secure by 120 words. Cost is felt but diffuse; a sharper, embodied forfeiture would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the shepherd returns to vigilance, clocks “at peace,” but the cost is only implied. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ticking density swells, then settles—yet the lack of a decisive change keeps it short of high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure is asserted—she “knew that she had truly begun to understand”—but no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural yet the final image does not reweight the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, but causality stalls in reflective loops.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: Elara crystallizes a therapy plan whose cost is implied but not yet felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of subway rides and graffiti insights reweights the stake. One transition (library → subway → library) is within scope. Orientation is clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a lyrical restatement rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the loop continues unchanged, so no before/after legible. Causality is loose—operator’s ritual answers calls, but no single beat tightens options or exacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single twilight scene, orientation clear by 120 words. Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the archivist walks away having “captured a moment,” but the cost is abstract and off-stage. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early yet final reweighting feels mild.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the station’s atmosphere shifts from despair to community. However, the moon rock’s agency is asserted rather than dramatized, and the rumor chain’s mechanics remain off-stage, blurring the causal lens. Cost is diffuse—no single forfeiture is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint’s convergence reweights the mapmaker’s self-knowledge with quiet blaze. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory pattern builds to cadence shift. Causality is loose but coherent under lyric design; no orientation debt. Cost is felt but abstract, limiting 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of writing with the restored pen crystallizes her new role as “guardian of this threshold,” and the cost is the irreversible step of editing reality. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the harbor is “forever tuned,” but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on the page. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; the lens holds, yet the decisive change feels gifted rather than earned through prior beats. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the trail of art culminates in a hidden alcove message that reweights the promise and the vandalism. Causality is mostly accumulative; each art piece adds density until the final reconfiguration. The lens holds, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt—no irrevocable forfeiture is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the lagoon dims but its glow “lingers,” reconfiguring the stake from loss to continuity. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—drumming intensifies light, light intensifies sorrow—but the tightening is modest; the universe’s “hush” is more mood than constraint. Orientation is clear by 120 words, and the lens holds, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a soft thematic echo rather than a decisive change: the stranger whispers, the worker smiles, stakes remain unchanged. Causal chain is loose—maps, key, coin do not narrow options or exact price. Drive lens drifts between situational mood piece and causal quest without committing; final image does not reweight prior material. Orientation is clear, but closure lacks cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a mood stasis rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; nothing is foreclosed and no cost is legible. Drive lens drifts between Accumulative/Textural patterning and Situational stance crystallization without settling, so the final image lacks re-weighting power.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the town’s “gentle glow of second thoughts”—but the cost is diffuse and off-stage. Causality is lyrical rather than tight; the grotto vision triggers the window plan without friction or forfeiture. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and Situational without decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained: each sensory layer (sunlight fading, whale song, glowing scrimshaw) thickens until the final luminous haze reconfigures meaning. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Kael’s stance crystallizes with the line “the disappearing island was not a place, but a state of being.” Cost is felt in the irrevocable swim into darkness, though the return to shore softens the finality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the farmhouse becomes sanctuary, narration ceases, and the turbines loom as charged poise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hush deepens until it crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in Echo’s unreadable eyes and the swallowed farmhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Lyra walking away bathed in colonnade-light reconfigures her stance toward art and boundary. However, the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the escalation is one long crescendo of lyric density rather than a discrete tightening; the cost is diffuse. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, but the beat-to-beat linkage is more associative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure arrives as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard becomes “a place where people came to see the world anew,” reweighting the premise of imperfection. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned deepening rather than causal linkage—and it holds. However, the decisive change is narrated rather than dramatized; the cost is communal, not personal, blunting the sting needed for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sound-making deepens until a final cadence shift (“music swelled…wonder and awe”). Closure is a Charged Poise, but the cost is only atmospheric; no concrete forfeiture is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory brightens, curtains peak, and the maker’s subdued ardor rekindles with a felt shift in stance. Causal chain (origami → star alignment → curtain glow → brooch) is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn light and coiled tape crystallize her stance without visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases—but the tightening is more mood than irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda reweights perception of the lost city. However, the causal chain is thin—avoiding patterns is told, not shown altering tactics—and the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—she “disappears into the clouds” with new insight—but the cost is only asserted (“weight of her task”) not dramatized. Causality is loose: the pattern she traces in the footage never narrows her options on the page; the shadow remains atmospheric rather than a force that compels a final decision. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights her vocation; however, the cost is felt conceptually rather than through an on-page forfeiture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the tightening beat is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chamber’s “stories in the scars” reweight Elian’s quest, and the hourglass pulses with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each descent beat deepens pattern—but the link between coffee-ring divination and chamber revelation is asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of letters thickens atmosphere until a Charged Poise reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (“weight of unused love lifting”) with felt cost, but causality between film strip and epiphany remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn arrives, creativity is “freed,” and the path is “illuminated.” Yet the cost is only asserted (“weight lifting”) rather than dramatized; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern held, but causality between ritual and breakthrough remains asserted, not proven.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing dune’s zenith reweights the archive’s purpose and Asa’s guardianship. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification rather than because/therefore—taught early by the “occasionally everywhere” box and paid off in the swirling light. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is a soft fade-out rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no felt cost is legible on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is too gentle to reweight the stake. Orientation is clear early, yet the ending drifts into summary. The gear’s hum never crystallizes into a final image that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as a threshold image (mist clearing, shore reached) but lacks a decisive change or felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final cadence merely repeats earlier mood. Orientation is clear early; causality is loose—travelers follow because they follow. No meaningful tightening or deepening reweights the stake before the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis (the bellhop accepts the silence), but the causality is weak: the tightening of the piano bench bolt is thematically suggestive yet has no causal bearing on the bellhop’s stance. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of snow and stillness intensifies, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present—pretender unmasked, Kael vanishes—but the decisive change occurs off-stage via spoken words whose power we never see built. Causal chain is summary: months of cryptic messages are asserted rather than dramatized, so the final confrontation lacks felt cost. Orientation is clear, yet the lens drifts between causal and accumulative without firm anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    A textured Accumulative pattern is taught early: returning reef, drum, atlas, charts. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the rhythm reframes how “truth” is heard—though cost is more conceptual than viscerally shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum crystallizes her stance and reweights the future. Causal linkage is thin—legendary stone circle solves inner crisis rather than arising from prior tactics—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the cost (accepting the rebellion’s continuation) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s glow reweights Akira’s stance toward tradition and future. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of plant-whispers and symbols tightens until the orb is lifted—but the kite-script decoding arrives late and resolves too smoothly, muting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Amira chooses to carry the stillness forward—but the causality is thin; the shift from trauma to resolve feels more accumulative than driven by a decisive beat. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the redesign of perception is legible, and the lighthouse beam reweights meaning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of untangling threads tightens once. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds: eclipse ends → ink trace → ridge encounter → shared gaze. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the moment of “shared understanding” reweights the mystery of time dilation without solving it, leaving a felt cost in Kael’s simmering anger. Orientation is anchored early; causality is thin but intact under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Aria watches the conversation ignite, her role irrevocably shifted. Causal chain (thaw → read → transmit) is clear and the lens (Causal) holds, though the cost is implied rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated images of roses, stone, and sword layer toward a final hush. Yet no single beat tightens or forecloses a live option; the tower collapse, airship wreck, and visitor influx are all back-story exposition. Orientation is clear by word 60, but causality remains slack—no because/therefore chain pushes Aria to a decisive moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise (“tranquil blaze”) but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Story obeys an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern breaks and deepening hum intensify toward Echo capture. Closure—goddess echo internalized—is on the page as Charged Poise (cosmic reweight), cost is cosmic wonder without quantifiable consequence. Arc structure is single-scene spiral; orientation anchors early and never drifts. No causality breaks, though agency is largely attentional rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain is outline-thin: journalist’s call → Adelaide decides to “intervene” by assuming the opposite → story ends before any contradiction is actually tested. Closure is a declared intent (“she was ready to uncover the truth”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is adequate, but the plot stalls at intention.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a soft atmospheric fade rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the cord tether and meteor hush are evocative but do not foreclose a path with felt cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative, yet the lens is not taught early enough to justify the final drift.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mandala’s completion crystallizes a new stance under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose—tile flake arrives by chance—but pattern break reweights perception with lilac unease as felt cost. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza is renamed, reweighting its meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens toward the final vibration. Cost is legible in the “shattered sky” that remains, but the renaming act itself is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s stillness and coin’s glow reconfigure Echo’s stance with lingering cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though the timeline repair feels asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn painting crystallizes her new stance with a felt cost (solitude traded for creative breakthrough). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens the pattern—though the recall’s causal weight fades after the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is a gentle affirmation (“she was at peace”) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final cadence merely restates earlier wonder without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the turner smiles at ongoing work—but the cost is abstract. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Orientation is clear by line 3. However, the prophecy-to-possibility shift is narrated, not enacted, blunting the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the reunion image, but the lens drifts from causal search to situational acceptance; the pillbox and snow codes never materially alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the fog lifts and both travelers share “deep understanding.” Yet the cost is only asserted (“never forget”), not dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mist, drip, needle—but the final cadence shift is gentle rather than charged. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, but stakes never tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass becomes talisman of kindness-infused resistance. Causality is textural/accumulative; the lens holds, but the cost is diffuse—no concrete forfeiture on the page. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the gardener finishes pruning, dawn rises, and the city is “wrapped in a soft blanket.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift lands, but the felt cost is diffuse rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure effect is Earned Stasis in the final paragraph—renunciation of solitude into acceptance—but the causality bridging memory → action → cost is outlined rather than dramatized.  Missing “how” the sundial epiphany reconfigures her stance on being alone; linkage stays thematic, not causal.  Orientation safe; library stone hum used well as anchoring device.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s realization that connection must be created, not found, reweights the premise. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of observation → participation → insight—yet the cost is diffuse (loss of solitary stance) rather than dramatized on the page, slightly blunting the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a declared victory (“the response was immediate… influence waned”) rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost. Causal linkage is weak: the counter-signal is transmitted in a single sentence and the cosmic opposition instantly folds off-stage. Orientation is clear, but the plot is an and-then sequence without meaningful tightening or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “vital key” becomes an insight, reweighting the quest. Causal chain is thin—organ music guides, crystal reveals—but the spatial mutiny is asserted rather than shown. Cost is implied (“leave this magical place”) yet not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is achieved through Charged Poise: the portrait and the shared gaze reconfigure their stances, leaving the felt cost of ongoing mystery and renewed empathy. Causality is soft-link rather than because/therefore: the ribbon cues memory, the memory cues empathy, empathy fuels painting, painting crystallizes new stance. No option is explicitly foreclosed, but mist and parting satisfy as earned stasis. One minor ellipsis: how “unified opposites” translates into concrete method remains asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.7)
    Closure is missing: the story circles the mystery of reversible exile without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. Causality stalls in recursive questioning; the final paragraph merely reiterates dread. Orientation is clear, but the lens drifts from causal to vaguely accumulative without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—music reframes the fiddler’s past—yet the pixelated-amnesty mechanism is introduced late and never tested on the page. Causality is lyrical rather than tight; the scaffold-wrap “secret” arrives as coincidence, not earned tactic. Orientation is clear, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is only loosely held.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a reflective RR (Charged Poise) that reweights the journey, but the cost is abstract—“a pang of empathy”—rather than dramatized. Causality is thematic, not event-driven; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a soft epiphany (“world seemed a little brighter”) without decisive change or felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the cadence shift is too gentle to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear, yet causality between telegram, stars, and breakthrough remains asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a thematic epiphany (“mirrors show the soul”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain is loose: the seed never activates, the expanding circles remain metaphor, and the mirror cracks without altering live options.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated sensory intensification toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands as a crystallized final moment (“the possibilities were endless”) that reconfigures stance, but the cost is only gestured (“anxious elation”) rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, yet the beat-to-beat linkage is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the orchard itself seems transformed. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing corridors reconfigure the space and her stance—yet the causal link between weaving the spell and the orchard’s approval is more atmospheric than mechanical, blunting the cost edge needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-scene structure is clear; orientation is swift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) crystallized in the final walk-out, but the causal link between phone call and resolve is thin—escalation is emotional, not tactical. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening beat lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration—“a deep sense of connection” and arbor bathed in understanding—earned through her pattern-linking labor; causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens where each analogy and seed response layers toward the unifying pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a quiet, lyrical stasis—librarian continues ritual amid timeless tides—but the causal chain is thin: no decisive change or felt cost is dramatized on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final paragraph reiterates rather than deepens or reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aria’s stance toward connection crystallizes with felt cost. Causal linkage is light—more textural accumulation than because/therefore—but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure lands as quiet reverie rather than decisive change—lovely, but lacks visible cost from the inferred lens; cause-and-effect linkage is aesthetic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a declared readiness (“she was ready to turn the page”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no cost is made legible. The causal chain is loose: coffee-stain prophecy → vague resolve → no irreversible act. Orientation is clear, but the lens drifts between situational pressure and lyrical accumulation without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene Accumulative/Textural arc: each sensory layer deepens until the emerald’s glow reconfigures the grotto’s hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the threshold recedes but remains felt—yet the cost is atmospheric, not character-specific. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural meditation, but no single beat tightens or reweights the stake; causality is loose and repetitive. Closure is a summary epiphany (“she realized…”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is clear, yet the lens never sharpens past atmospheric drift.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the cloak is “unhooked” and the client’s certainty is “tempered,” but the decisive change is asserted rather than dramatized on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of chimes, mirror shard, dawn light—but the final beat lacks a visible, felt cost to the conscience. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of withheld detail and rippling pond reweights perception. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—student’s “perfect clarity” reconfigures understanding—but cost is conceptual only, not dramatized. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—stillness becomes a new mode of movement—but the cost is conceptual, not dramatized. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the pattern of layered dust repeats without a final intensifying shift.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained: each paragraph layers sensory density until the keystone’s glow reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden’s light crystallizes Eira’s stance—but the cost is only implied (“memory of the keystone’s gentle glow”), not felt on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Causal thread feels causal only in patches; the library key appears too late to be the signal cause for final wonder. Closure lands lyrically—an Accumulative/Textural image of lanterns, not a decisive reconfiguration—so lens stays mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—wavelength aligned, prophecy set—but causality is thin: coins → static → distillation → alignment happens without intermediate reversals or stakes. Orientation holds; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory density until the final image reweights the atlas page as a charged relic. Closure is a Charged Poise—the reaper’s silent renunciation of forgetting—felt but not yet paid, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s toll crystallizes the mage’s stance and reweights the world’s balance. Causal chain is clear—ritual drip → bell rebirth → cosmic shift—yet the “cosmic imbalance” remains abstract, blunting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative lens: patterned tightening via photographs links beats of decay toward a resonant stillness. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—“a precisely humane endeavor… silent now”—but lack of a demonstrable pivot or new constraint undercuts causal impact. Anchors clear early; no Orientation dent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the orchard glows and she “knows she is on the right path”—but the lens drifts between Accumulative/Textural and Situational without tightening causality; no concrete cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene structure holds; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise. However, the causal linkage between star-chart revision and trust preservation is implied rather than demonstrated, and the cost of her vigilance is only named, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    No discernible before/after caused by the meditation sequence; the eccentric premise signals an Accumulative/Textural lens yet adds texture without cohesion. Closure is asserted (“He was free”) rather than dramatized—the dojo doors opening does not foreclose any path or make the cost legible. Historical flux remains background static; timeline slippage fails to narrow Kaito’s options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn light crystallizes the proprietor’s new theme but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of imagery and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (night → dawn) is handled cleanly. Closure lacks a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the household’s silence is reweighted into bittersweet resonance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the leaf-blower melody accumulates memory-whispers until laughter returns. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mist clears, statues shift, and she embraces uncertainty with the pendant glowing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of mist and statues reweights the stake. Causality is loose; the turn hinges on reverie rather than a concrete trigger, but the final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the broken crozier is transformed, destiny is interrupted, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of twilight, scent, and vibration tightens until the new creation crystallizes. One transition (gathering fragments → weaving pattern) is coherent and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers sensory fragments until the final crystallization. Closure is a Charged Poise—the city’s silhouette “whispers” a reconfiguration of meaning, cost felt as irrevocable wonder. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props. Minor drift: the shard’s causal role is more thematic than tactical, slightly softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara steps into the unknown with cost implied by the “permanent transient-ness.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density rises, but the vanishing-ferry mystery is never tested on-page, so the tightening is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gallery resets, the thread lingers, and the architect’s stance toward “rational enchantment” is crystallized. Cost is implied (she leaves altered) but not dramatized on-page; the price is conceptual rather than felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight meaning. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a thematic summary (“beacon of hope”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no cost is dramatized. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final paragraph merely reiterates earlier uplift without a cadence shift that reweights stakes. Orientation is clear, yet the sequence of beats—walk, teach, watch students leave—lacks causal tightening. The anchor chain returns only as symbol, not as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the mist clears, the woman leaves lighter, Aria stays behind changed. Causality is situational—Aria follows pulses, speaks comfort, atmosphere responds—but no tightening choice narrows options or exacts visible price. Orientation is clear within 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Cost is implied, not legible on the page, keeping the score below 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she escapes with codex and altered perception—but the causal chain is thin: gold fleck appears only at the exit, phase transition is asserted rather than prepared, and tidal deadline feels ornamental. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens (Causal) wobbles because the critical mechanics (cable travel) are withheld until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final letting-go of the shard crystallizes a stance rather than fixes a plot. The causal chain wobbles—how spilled ink translates to code is hand-waved—but the final image satisfies under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of birds, shadows, and echoes intensifies toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and sustained. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canyon “reverberate[s] with a newfound sense of purpose”—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative lens: static voices layer into a final harmonic revelation. Orientation is clear by word 60, but causality is loose—arrowhead energy and phone confessions arrive as gifts, not choices that narrow options. The “metamorphose” beat is declared, not dramatized, so the closure image (“frostbitten hope”) lacks a felt price. No persistent constraint or foreclosed path is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory music until the orchard “vibrates with renewed vitality,” a clear cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statues walk free and the sky-bridge glows, reweighting the premise. However, the cost to Luna herself is only implied, not dramatized, slightly thinning the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mailman’s quiet nod crystallizes risk and hope while drones still hum overhead. Causal chain holds—absence pattern → crossing → delivery—but the “linking absences” method is asserted rather than shown in scene, blurring the lens clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise—the carpenter returns to work “infused with a newfound sense of purpose”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of mist, bells, halo glow thickens toward dawn. However, the oasis detour is a gratuitous coincidence that does not tighten the pattern or foreclose an option; it merely supplies mood.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—she achieves the goal and rests—but the price is asserted not enacted: "for a little while" signals duration without dramatized limitation. Causal chain hangs entirely on belief ("believed that stories...dwelt beyond the physical") rather than demonstrated evidence or compounding choice narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn accretes more pigment of longing. Yet the closure is a lyrical reprise, not a tightening; the “mystery” remains identical to its opening state, so no decisive change or reconfiguration occurs. Cost is asserted (“elusive dream”) but not made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the freed idea disperses, reweighting the world. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of starlight → lock → release. Orientation is clear by 80 words. Cost is conceptual (locksmith releases “a piece of themselves”) but not visibly tethered to a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mood thickens, image of glowing mushroom recurs, final stance crystallizes. Yet closure is a declared intention (“ready to see it through”) without on-page Decisive Change or felt cost; it remains prospective.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist’s annotations crystallize into a “quiet triumph” that reweights the shadow’s exile. Causal chain is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the exact moment of cost is diffuse—felt but not sharply legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft CR: the world “seemed to whisper a gentle thank you,” but the conceptual reweighting is asserted, not dramatized, and lacks a felt price. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence intensifies through repeated lyrical swell, yet no single tightening beat narrows options or reveals cost. Orientation is clear, but causality remains loose—seed planted → world restored with no intermediate reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence thickens, colors intensify, spirits disperse in a single cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—as the restorer accepts perpetual return to the craft; cost is the accumulated silence she now carries. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One transition (walking away) is within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene; orientation is swift and stable. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map “now seemed whole” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of attention deepens rather than pivots—so one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty snow globe reweights the premise that letting go is reframing, not release. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (logbook, net, globe) layers density until the final image crystallizes the cost. One causality wobble: the net-message arrives as pure gift, not earned by prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charcoal stroke thickens the pattern until the mural crystallizes into a Charged Poise—the ghost’s breeze reconfigures both courtyard and self. Orientation is swift; the mist, bench, and storm are anchored by line 3. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: the balladeer leaves “forever changed,” the courtyard likewise. Minor drift: the causal link between bolt plate and final beat is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene elevator ride cleanly anchored; causality is soft-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as Charged Poise—diary’s love story reconfigures Elara’s stance toward the spire—but the cost is felt obliquely rather than visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical density and cadence shift memorialize the storm. Closure is a Charged Poise—“sense of spooled wholeness”—but the cost is atmospheric rather than a concrete forfeiture or reconfiguration of options. Orientation is clear early; no causality break, yet stakes feel internal and low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the rising density of stillness, scent, and mirrored sky tightens toward the Charged Poise of the glowing portrait. Closure lands cleanly, though the demolition countdown is announced rather than shown ticking.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft CR (new map, new resolve) rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the reconfiguration lacks felt price. Orientation is clear, and the pattern of decoding is legible, yet the ending drifts rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kael steps into the hall of mirrors and feels “the secrets of the universe were now within their grasp,” but the causal chain from deciphering prophecy to opening the door is thin; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the cost is only implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is a communal celebration that reconfigures the planet’s energy, but the decisive change is collective, diffuse, and off-stage; Aria’s agency is spectral guidance, not a choice with visible cost. The chalked messages are clever but appear late and are deciphered in summary rather than dramatized beats. Causality is more inspirational than causal; the nebula’s energy feels like grace rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lullaby spreads across the hush, reweighting the premise with felt awe. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is clear—nut → blueprint → labyrinth reactivation—yet the decisive change (glowing stones guiding travelers) is narrated rather than shown on-page; cost is implied but not felt by the caretaker in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; the ravine observation triggers the causal insight that reconfigures her research goal. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the new purpose is crystallized, the cost is the irrevocable loss of Sofia and the old self. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ember returns the bottle, now hearing the library’s “ethereal music,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she forfeits immediate knowledge for guardianship. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of attention (quantifying absence) thickens atmosphere until meaning crystallizes. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Minor time-line wobble: “first opening day” lull stretches without clock or customer intrusion, but this does not breach closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s touch absorbs the pavilion’s remorse and reconfigures it into “no longer jagged,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—why the pavilion calls now is unexplained—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the ending image reweights earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft conceptual shift—silos “now seemed to be bridging”—but lacks on-page Decisive Change or felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the lyrical cadence intensifies, yet the final image does not reweight stakes with undeniable pressure. Causality remains loose: the conversation does not visibly alter the town or Emilia’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored mirror now holds accessible memories, reweighting Elara’s identity. Causality is soft—her “chaotically precise” mind is asserted rather than shown steering key beats—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural. Cost is conceptual (she is “changed”) but not rendered on the page as a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves with knowledge and burden—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, though the grotto’s rules are asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory density until the porcelain insulator reweights the sculpture and the grove resonates. Closure is a Charged Poise—the grove “still swaying” after the sculptor leaves—yet the cost is diffuse, more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure is a lyrical mood crystallization (Charged Poise) rather than a Decisive Change; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, but the cost is atmospheric, not legible on the page. Orientation is clear by 120 words, yet causality is loose—no because/therefore linkage tightens options. The ending reconfigures meaning but without a felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the closure beat—“she knew that she would carry the lessons…”—is summary, not a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is clear, but causality is loose: the clasp glows and releases without prior setup or constraint. No meaningful tightening or deepening reweights the stake; the story drifts to a reflective stop rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: seed → bloom → expanded senses → earned stillness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the fragrance crystallizes her stance; cost is felt in the irrevocable shift of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s worldview shifts when she witnesses the echo-pool. However, the causal linkage between the arrow-tip and this revelation is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she exits the labyrinth “one step closer,” but the cost is only implied. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of wind notes and container geometry—but the final reconfiguration lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks, yet no decisive pivot either.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the hush released, wonder certified), yet the causal chain from song to silence is lyric rather than because/therefore; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flute’s silence and the sentinel markers reconfigure her stance toward future returns, with the cost felt in her “newfound reverence.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though driftwood markers appear late and lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the print’s “lucid turbulence” reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies until stars vanish. Orientation is clear by 70 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained, but closure is only a mood shift—no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration with visible cost. The final image (“pendant’s vibrations seemed to echo”) is decorative, not a reweighting of stakes. Orientation is clear, yet the plot drifts along the ridgeway without tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is clear by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as mist lifts and she “knows” truth, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern deepens but lacks tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the loom spinner’s resolve crystallizes in the final image, but the cost is only implied (“latent sacrifice”) rather than felt. Causality is loose—puzzle completion is metaphorically linked to reconnection, yet no concrete beat shows how the puzzle or weaving materially bridges the silence. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (orchard scent, pickaxe echoes, silk shimmer) thickens until the sword’s shimmer crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the apprentice’s wonder reconfigures the smith’s solitude into mentorship—yet the cost (loss of isolation) is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the multiverse is “never seen the same way again.” However, the lens drifts between Accumulative/Textural and Situational; the doorway’s rules are never constrained, so causality feels ornamental. Cost is asserted (“changed forever”) rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the extinguished lamp, anonymous letters, and stone cairns layer pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the cairn’s glow reweights the ache—yet the cost is more atmospheric than concrete. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the dawn arrives and the herald walks away, her task “done,” yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the ritual’s steps feel predetermined. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene default is met, but the ending’s reweighting is more decorative than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light-play thickens toward a resonant image. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a deepening understanding”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized; nothing is foreclosed. Orientation is clear, yet the ending drifts into summary rather than final, visible beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant’s restoration glows with lunar light, sorrow dissipates, and the worker steps into a wider vocation. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than tight; the pin-drop moment feels symbolic rather than causal. Orientation is swift and sustained; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the greenhouse brightens, the realm stirs, and she steps back into darkness carrying the mica’s pulse. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—song layers build luminous density—yet the decisive change is more mood than irrevocable act.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single continuous scene, clear orientation by line 5, closure lands as Charged Poise: Elys re-weights the invitation and the paradox, foreclosing avoidance with a felt but quiet cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten once at the slip of paper. No causality breaks; however, the “mistake” backstory is delivered in one reflective block that slightly dilutes present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—the noticer’s gratitude and promise to return reconfigure her stance with a felt, if subtle, cost of leaving the sanctuary. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated visits and sensory layering tighten the emotional cadence. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—Elara returns the slide with “satisfaction”—but the cost is abstract and off-stage. Causality is loose: the lantern slide glows, frequencies reveal a pattern, yet no concrete choice narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene structure holds; causal chain is present (find fob → confront Shadow → fragile truce). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the truce reweights the market’s social fabric. However, the “sound of trust breaking” remains off-page, muting the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a CR image (cosmic connection) but arrives via coincidence—the stranger appears exactly when the ring pulses—rather than because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early, yet the drive lens shifts from causal to situational without teaching the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken lock’s crystalline transformation mirrors the internal unblocking, making the before/after legible. Causality is accumulative/textural—pressure builds through pattern and cadence rather than strict because/therefore links—yet the lens holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the chamber of gilded scripts reweights her art. Causality is causal-lite—each step follows plausibly—but the map’s mechanics are elided; the postal plate’s decoding happens off-stage, softening the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is a declarative Conceptual Repricing (“era of words ending”) rather than a dramatized pivot; cost is abstract. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is diffuse—repetitive paragraphs of rising wonder without tightening stakes. Orientation is clear early, yet causality between iceberg arrival and universal linguistic shift is asserted, not built.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the controlled burn reweights the box and the dome’s meaning, with the cost of scorched roses and Aria’s irreversible shift in stance. Causal linkage holds—burn announced → Aria chooses containment → aftermath reframes her identity. One minor ellipsis: how the enclosures actually “miniaturize” chaos is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is a soft thematic affirmation, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the courtyard’s “haven of peace” is restored without any price paid or path foreclosed. Causality is loose: the locket’s discovery never alters tactics, and the mailbox mystery resolves off-stage via communal storytelling summaries. Orientation is clear early, but the story drifts into montage rather than tightening pressure. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return of the dice, journal, and spider web layers pattern until the final Charged Poise. Yet the causality between decoding and the door opening is elided; the cost is felt but not visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—memories restored, stance shifted—but the causal chain from whale → gravity shift → coffee-ground vision → crystal is asserted rather than demonstrated. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern and mood deepen, yet the tightening beat is the crystal’s touch, not the lighter’s. Cost is implied (overwhelming memory) yet not dramatized as forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: silence thickens line by line, reweighting the prophecy into static. Closure as Charged Poise—the glowing wing drifts away—costs the summoner their vigilance; hush is achieved. Causality intact, if lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: handing over the seal crystallizes the transfer of curiosity, but the cost is abstract rather than felt. Causal chain is loose—meteor shower decorates rather than narrows options. Orientation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a soft epiphany rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the garden’s farewell is ornamental, not causally tied to Lyra’s new stance. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely re-states earlier motifs without reweighting them. No persistent constraint or price shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she steps back, “peace wash over her”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light, scent, and color intensifies toward the pearl-twilight page. However, the causal chain between key, thorn, and textual subversion remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: Aria absorbs lingering echoes and chooses to keep listening. However, the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening—her song “weaving truth”—is described rather than enacted; the cost is only implied. Orientation is clear, but causality between song and revelation remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a lyric reprise—melted snow globe now empty, shrine glowing—creating a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of images (candle, ice, starlight) intensifies toward final glow, yet no single beat narrows options or forces a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, but causality between vision and action remains soft (“she stepped out… ready to face whatever lay ahead” is prospective, not enacted).

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as quiet Charged Poise, but the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is only implied. Orientation is clear early; no causal reversals, only deepening mood. The whisk and moon path serve as pattern, not plot.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Aria stands before the pulsing stillpoint, options reconfigured, cost implied by the eerie glow. Causal chain is thin—shredded letters lead directly to diamond—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the visionary smiles back at a dawn already achieved, but the decisive change occurs off-stage in the populace, not through her agency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—mood and image accumulate toward a final tableau—yet the ending lacks a felt cost exacted from her. Orientation is clear early; causality is loose, more montage than because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet resolves to write, reconfiguring isolation into purpose. However, the causal chain is thin—no prior beat shows why this dawn differs from any other, so the turn feels convenient. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (light, ice, gull-cry) thickens until the final “silence that was a tapestry” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—artifact safe, world unchanged yet re-perceived—cost is the fading light and her vigilance renewed. Orientation anchors early; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moon-tracking and viaduct hum build density toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands as moon dips and hum crescendos, reconfiguring stakes. Cost is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maya exits “changed”—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the lantern’s reprise reweights meaning rather than causing a decisive act. Cost is implied (“no longer controlled”) yet not made visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the chaplain leaves with “renewed purpose,” but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. Causal chain is thin—clockwork heart and music box act as thematic mirrors rather than active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the unheard bell reweights the workshop into “harmonious entity.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterns accrue through kaleidoscope turns until insight crystallizes. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens contradiction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of 4-1-5-9 tightens until the reveal that files were archived, not deleted. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt absence, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse adds density until the crystal’s reconstitution crystallizes stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing crystal reconfigures her role and the landscape’s breath. One smooth transition from orchard to lighthouse keeps scope tight. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of standing amid wreckage with “windborne solace” reconfigures the protagonist’s stance with visible emotional cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of labor and sensory detail tightens toward acceptance. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single continuous scene; orientation is clear by 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sentinel’s realization reweights premise—but cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Causal linkage is loose; events accumulate rather than tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration (sanctuary secured, peace felt), but the causal chain is thin: the prophet’s arrival triggers no concrete obstacle or trade-off. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the deepening calm is legible, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The implied Accumulative/Textural lens tracks a single deepening—photographs piling toward “a masterpiece”—but closure is delivered in the vaguest “ready… work that lay ahead.” No DC, RR or CR is crystallized; absence of a legible cost blunts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-seeking and silence accumulate until the summons ruptures the hush. Closure is a Charged Poise—scholar stepping into dawn with crystal—reconfiguring options. Causality is loose; the summons arrives without prior trigger, and the cost of testimony is gestured at, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the prophet accepts that the “sound of growing older” is to be felt, not found, discarding the chalk with visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density build until the fog reclaims the driftwood path. Orientation is fog-soft but legible by 120 words; no causality breaks. The ending beat lands cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the still clock hand reframes escape velocity as transcendence of self. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterned reflection and tremor imagery tighten toward the final image. However, the causal bridge between “earth tremors” and Eli’s insight is asserted, not demonstrated; the cost is poetic but not materially legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: Emma’s eased passing reweights the vinyl shard and the scent of hope, and the cost is Emma’s life, felt on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final lullaby crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece presents a single, continuous scene that meets length defaults, but causality is weak: research steps are summarized rather than linked by “because/therefore.” The clockwork key’s significance is declared in the final paragraph without prior causal setup that would make the revelation inevitable. Closure is a thematic statement (“key as metaphor”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Emilia exits the garden with clarified purpose—but the cost is only implied, not felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening beat (picking up the tooth) is underplayed and the final cadence shift is gentle rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing strokes layer density until the sea glass glows, reweighting the grotto’s hush. Closure is a Charged Poise—the zephyr bloom suffuses the space—but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s hush and the flower reconfigure Aria’s stance toward vulnerability, and the amber pendant’s reweighting is legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern, silence, and gift accumulate to a crystallized moment—though the causal chain is light, the cost is felt in her lighter heart.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of mist re-settling reconfigures the novelist’s stance with felt cost (she must “continue… against the current”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mist/shell/muse tightens cadence. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the melody’s density increases until the arbor becomes sacred space. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lingering hush after song—yet the cost (time, risk of failure) is stated rather than embodied on the page. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks, but the final beat lacks a felt personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each patterned meditation adds density until the plate’s glow reconfigures meaning; closure lands with felt cost as Aria channels life-force, sealing her essence into the map.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the ticking clockwork re-animates, re-weighting the cavern’s silence, yet the cost is only implied (“carry the wonder… stored safely”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reflection study—but the single tightening beat lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is secure; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the tapestry reconfigures meaning and the grotto hums—but the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; causality is atmospheric rather than because/therefore, which is acceptable under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the finished carving crystallizes grief into “rust-hued peace.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory detail and cadence shift reweight the stake. However, the cost is more asserted (“something manageable”) than dramatized; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks, yet escalation is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the shutter click reweighting the scavenger’s stance toward the past. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but the tightening beat is more cadence shift than option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern of “discover–restore–glow” repeats without tightening or deepening; the closure image of the glowing terminal is lovely but does not reweight the premise or foreclose a path. No felt cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhythmic return of “glacial hush / petrichor nostalgia” deepens the stake until the sunrise reweights it. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elian returns to duty with “spirit renewed,” a credible reconfiguration, yet the cost is only asserted (“not too late”), not dramatized. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—when the sundial’s glow reframes her past motives; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft “she had uncovered a piece” rather than a decisive change or charged poise; the rope’s decoded message is withheld from the reader, blunting reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds, but the ending drifts into summary. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s silence is reconfigured into “quiet, otherworldly music,” and the cost is the irrevocable snap of the thread. Causality is accumulative/textural; the pattern of absence and writing tightens into the final image without contradiction. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural pattern—each pattern-dense detail layers until the mechanized world slow-shifts—holds; closure lands as resonant reconfiguration when the heartbeat stills and beauty stirs, visible cost felt in the prince’s tears and world-wide hush.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Aria standing watch reconfigures her stance from passive healing to active guardianship, and the cost is felt in the open-ended vigil. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each reflection and sensory layer tightens the thematic stake without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the stained glass box is opened, memories released, fountains stir—an unmistakable Decisive Change with felt civic cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each breadcrumb tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the city’s future. Orientation is secure by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the burden of sharing light without fire, reweighting earlier motifs. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift carry the cost. No causality break, though agency is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk thickens, butterflies arrive, ribbon unrolls, and the greenhouse’s lunar glow crystallizes the reconfiguration. Closure is a Charged Poise—grief reweighted by beauty—yet the cost (accepting loss as cyclical) is only implicitly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive drifts; causal link between seeing inscriptions and walking is inferential rather than dramatized. Closure beats with Charged Poise—“I step into light” echo—but no external price is shown or foreclosed, so the cost feels conceptual, not lived. Orienting landmarks are clear; no caps invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft epiphany (“journey just begun”) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent—images layer toward a mood—but the ending merely promises continuation, not a before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poised pen crystallizes stakes and reconfigures possibility with felt cost (“the future was being written”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though causality is more lyrical than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust swirls into ephemeral storyform, reweighting the alcove from solitude to portal. Causal chain—broadcast → transcription → dust animation—holds cleanly. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is present but generalized (“obsession that had driven her for years”).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the ash dispersal crystallizes the theme of impermanence with a felt, if muted, cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift replace causal linkage. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props. Yet the tightening is modest; one could remove the final Eli line without breaking the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise (the smile in darkness) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight the stake with new density or pattern break. Orientation is clear early, but the piece never tightens—Kael’s digging and thinking loop without a decisive beat that forecloses an option. Causality remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of stillness and rosette imagery deepens toward a Charged Poise. Yet the decisive reconfiguration is atmospheric, not causal; no concrete cost is legible on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The plot traces an Accumulative/Textural arc: vignettes of preparation cumulatively charge the greenhouse until the alignment reweights everything. Closure is a Charged Poise (“new story was growing”) with conceptual rather than visceral cost; the lens holds but could be more taut.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing (“failures that preserve wonder”) but the cost is abstract; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Orientation is clear early. The riddle and log arrive late and do not alter tactics; the ascent feels like scenic tour rather than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the house’s aliveness is newly legible and Eli’s stance toward it is crystallized. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hush and object placement tightens toward the charged image—yet the causal chain from shard to revelation is more associative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—garden re-seen as thriving—earned by the statue’s telepathic synthesis. Causality is soft: the ampoule’s arrival triggers revelation rather than a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear early; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds elegantly—the staircase and dice serve as coherent iterations of obsession. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the final line crystallizes a self-aware perpetuity. Minor causality wobble: the rupture roll has no tangible consequence within the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the dawn image crystallizes the painter’s commitment with felt cost (“weight of her task”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of moonlight, memory, and brush-stroke density builds to cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. However, causality is loose: memories arrive as grace notes rather than triggers that foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena’s resolve crystallizes as the group exits, reweighting the opera glass and bread sculptures as symbols of duty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of revealed histories tightens the stake. Yet the decisive change is off-stage; we are told she “felt a sense of purpose” rather than shown a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands (stone glows, lighthouse lit) but the causal chain is thin: the yoyo puzzle is introduced late, solved off-stage, and the cost is only rhetorical. Orientation is clear early; lens is causal but under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.7)
    Closure is a fade-to-black followed by summary; the decisive change (if any) happens off-page. Causal chain stalls at the mirror beat; the final “funhouse is always waiting” is a tag-line, not a reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—music fuses with night, orchard drifts to sleep—but the felt cost is diffuse. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a situational Charged Poise: Lyra steps beyond the city, watchers looming, cost implied but not yet felt on the page. Causal chain is loose—pattern reading triggers crack, reveals map, but no therefore linkage between map and the decision to leave; motivation is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. Lens holds as situational pressure crystallizing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a tidy success beat—sunlight, smile, ivy relaxing—without a felt or conceptual price. The causal chain is clear (find letter → decode → leave), but the ending lacks the required cost under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamped mark crystallizes her altered stance and links past to future. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of deepening insight—held cleanly to the final image. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lantern and crane layers density until the closing image reweights grief into radiance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief “unfolds like lotus petals”—with felt cost, though the basilica remains ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pair chart a course into the unknown, reweighting the stakes from personal grief to global potential. However, the drive lens drifts from situational trauma to conceptual quest without a decisive on-page pivot; the “shocking revelation” is delivered by summary, not dramatized choice. Causality holds but feels outline-like in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory and intellectual density until the star-map → chip → console pattern crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise (“brilliant dimness” reconfigures meaning), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks into the night “with a sense of resolve,” reconfiguring her stance toward the withheld truth. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—images (watch hand, carvings, terrace) accrue pressure until the final crystallization. However, the cost is only implied; no forfeiture or irrevocable act appears on the page, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—the negotiator walks away with the pull in pocket, claiming peace—but the cost is asserted, not felt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; moon phases pattern tension, yet the decisive shift is narrated rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks, but escalation is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-scene structure is clear; causality is causal-lite (“because compass broke, therefore paddle”). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he keeps the broken compass yet feels hope—but the cost is asserted, not visible. Orientation is fine; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.7)
    The cryptic ad and glowing ball set up a quest but the causal chain stalls: Lena walks, finds, feels, and keeps walking. Closure is a fade-out rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the “journey beginning” line undercuts on-page resolution. Orientation is clear, but escalation and cost are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra’s expanded perception—but the causal chain from fortune → ritual → metamorphosis is asserted rather than tested. The “paradoxically steady” beat is told, not shown, blurring the decisive change. Orientation is clear, yet the lens drifts between causal and accumulative without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is a single, continuous scene with one transition (memory flash), fitting the 600–800 word default. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “cloudbound repentance” crystallizes as acceptance of lost time. However, causality is more associative than because/therefore; the cracked saucer and hand-tracings mirror loss but do not force a narrowing of options. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.5)
    Shadow-work-as-dimension-key appears first at paragraph four, too late to anchor causality; closure offers a “creaked open” dimension but no on-page Decisive Change or visible cost, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—Aria’s worldview shifts—but the causal chain is loose prophecy coincidence rather than because/therefore; the cost is asserted (“never see the world the same”) rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cradle ignites and the fort is “reborn.” Yet the blackout’s cause, the conspirator’s identity, and the mechanism of the cradle remain off-stage conveniences. Orientation is clear, but causality is soft—events happen “as if” ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vision reweights the premise and the herder’s stance crystallizes with a felt conceptual cost (“weight of unfulfilled prophecies had been lifted”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density tightens toward the final image without causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s beauty reframed by new self-knowledge. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lens holds, yet the envelope’s payoff feels slightly unearned because its earlier concealment is only asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure beat—“the hidden overture was revealed in all its glory”—is asserted, not shown; no on-page sentence lets us witness the conceptual repricing or feel its cost. Causality is causal-lite: because he studied the sundial, therefore he wins, but the linkage is summary. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene frame is respected. The lens holds (Causal), yet the decisive change is off-stage, blunting the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the poet surveys the dawn-lit library and feels hope. Cost is gestural (“not yet saved”) rather than concrete. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of rising hope—but the final image does not reweight prior stakes; it merely restates them. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she steps back into the arbor “ready” to follow compasses, but the cost is asserted, not shown. Causal chain is loose—film-reel mechanics are never taught, so stepping into the hidden world feels like teleportation. Orientation is dreamy but coherent; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the monsoon arrives, memories are “safe,” but the cost is diffuse. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tending seed + interpreting dreams tightens toward rain. Orientation is clear, yet the decisive change lacks a palpable forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene structure holds; causal chain (find compass → weave lace → release compass) is legible. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: releasing the compass forecloses reunion and carries felt, if quiet, cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Minor drift into summary weakens tightening.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lacks visible cost: final image restates theme without reconfiguration ("dust... shaping the universe" echoes opening). Under Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights stakes; thematic echo replaces earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern convergence (ledger/frost), but cost remains conceptual ("fragility and beauty") rather than legible on-page. Orientation is crisp early, yet the Charged Poise closure lacks tangible forfeiture—peace settles without visible tradeoff, weakening the stakes reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof: "pang of gratitude" and "music carried" show no legible sacrifice or altered options; lens (Accumulative) holds but pressure never tightens beyond aesthetic refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: the undertaker's endurance as guardian forecloses his old life with visible cost ("Years passed"), crystallizing stillness as tangible sanctuary; minor deduction for near-moralizing in "path to serenity" muddying the final image's purity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the bell's final chime crystallizing resilience, but cost remains abstract—no visible price paid on the page for sanctions endurance. Orientation anchors early but cost proof fails; cannot point to exact sentence where cost manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Orientation debt: "twilight viaduct" setting anchors only at 138 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise: "love flowing into darkness") carries conceptual cost but lens ambiguity—Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid—undermines escalation. Pilgrim's disappearance lacks consequence, weakening causality in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lens ambiguity past midpoint: shifts from causal ("determined to unlock") to accumulative without clear teaching. Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof—"boundaries began to blur" is vague, not visceral. Orientation solid but lens instability undermines escalation coherence. No visible price charges the final gathering gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lacks legible cost—liberator succeeds effortlessly with no sacrifice. "Chained" metaphor never operationalized; vault guards bypassed without consequence. Violates cost proof test: no sentence/image where price is felt at ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("dull ache" persisting despite success), but cost legibility falters in final image; aurora-to-dawn shift deepens stakes under Accumulative lens without tangible price escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: Lumina trades artistic purity for occult pursuit, signaled by jar tucked away. But lens ambiguity—Accumulative/Textural pressure lacks density increase; moonbeam jar appears too late to reweight stakes organically.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—dripping water "reminder" feels decorative, not consequential. Accumulative lens holds, but "daunting prospect" resolves without felt sacrifice. Missing cost proof per Q2 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors library setting early, but decryption process lacks causal pressure—no tangible obstacles or cost during puzzle-solving. Charged Poise closure ("trembling certainty") qualifies but conceptual cost remains abstract; the "truth is in the shadows" revelation feels unearned without prior constraint. Lens holds as Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("shadows rearranged"), but the "felt cost" remains oblique. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the single deepening lacks sufficient causal pressure for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Charged Poise RR) lands with conceptual cost but escalation lacks density increase—looped reflections repeat without pattern break. "Twilight deepened" cadence shift too subtle for meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens. Cost proof vague ("growing understanding" not legible price).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure (freedom via lens) lacks felt cost—mistrust dissolves magically without trade-off. Accumulative lens holds but pressure never tightens; "resonant hush" offers no reconfiguration beyond abstract peace. No price paid for honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative lens holds but lacks meaningful escalation; closure (garden knowing dresser) carries emotional weight yet cost remains conceptual without on-page dramatization of sacrifice during the polishing ritual's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "icy warmth of discovery spreading" crystallizes irreversible cost with causal lens intact. "Subdued awakenings" phrase slightly muddies the pressure at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "sense of peace" replaces concrete stakes, with no before/after reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds through imagery density, but water-damage "revelation" feels coincidental, not earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("truths provisional and ephemeral"), but Accumulative/Textural escalation lacks decisive intensification—logbook note accumulation shows density without meaningful pressure shift; one non-closure issue caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lacks legible cost: logbook discovery yields instant "satisfaction" with no enduring consequence for the "swallowed truth." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but Charged Poise fails without felt price at "newfound clarity."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "crumbling peace" ending offers no visible consequence for burrowing deeper. Accumulative lens holds but regenerative silence lacks felt price—closure reads as thematic echo, not reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails cost proof test: Eli’s "awe" is asserted without legible consequence ("she had done her job" declares success but shows no trade-off), violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for felt cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("sense of completion") lacks legible cost—no altered tactics or tangible loss; "bronze quiet" atmosphere accumulates but fails to reweight stakes with felt consequence, undermining the Accumulative/Textural lens at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure fails cost proof test: dawn departure shows no legible consequence ("lives forever intertwined" is assertion, not earned change); Accumulative lens weakens as microdot specs never impact choices, leaving pressure untransformed.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands but cost remains narratively asserted ("possession averted") rather than dramatized. Accumulative lens holds, yet the "unraveling stillness" lacks causal pressure—escalation feels atmospheric, not earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the writer's resolved departure, but cost ("exhaustion hit") is future-tense and conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page. Orientation flawless within 120 words, yet accumulation cap -0.8 applied for two distinct non-closure issues: vague time pressure and thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in echoes and shifting labyrinth, culminating in valid Charged Poise closure where coalescing darkness charges the final image. Cost is conceptual (viaduct's light drained, reality reshaped) but lacks visceral specificity—felt stakes remain atmospheric rather than personally sacrificial at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence/image showing tangible price paid for Aria's peace beyond stated "numbness recede".

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "newfound purpose" shows determination but no legible on-page cost (e.g., sacrificed safety, altered state). Accumulative lens holds, but Earned Stasis lacks visible consequence for the "rogue quarantine zone" stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test fails: unclear who/where/when past 120 words (vague "greenhouse for extinct plants" anchor delayed). Accumulative lens holds, but Earned Stasis closure lacks legible cost—tears release isn't charged with tangible forfeiture. UV light activation feels coincidental, not pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when dawn reveals patterns as permanent truth with cost ("weight of those choices"), under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 3, but escalation lacks one decisive intensification—patterns deepen without narrowing options beyond the rope's symbolic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis valid (hush transformed but persistent), cost legible in "reminder of beauty." But Accumulative escalation falters—music's transformative effect occurs without pressure buildup or narrowing options, violating lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: grotto holding memory of crafted emotions implies emotional labor's residue. Lens ambiguity early (Causal vs Accumulative) weakens escalation until midpoint crystallizes textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("cycles of compassion"), but cost proof fails—no exact image concretizes loss beyond abstract "fulfillment." Causal lens holds cleanly through locket discovery to project initiation, though escalation lacks narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (transformed ache), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—finding the tag resolves isolation instantly without narrowing options or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lens ambiguity caps score: Hybrid elements (Accumulative/Textural buildup with causal hints) aren't clarified by midpoint. Cost is legible ("giant stirred... tremor beneath her feet") but lens instability prevents higher band despite solid Charged Poise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("fluid landscape" insight), but "ambiguous loss" lacks pinpoint legibility; Accumulative lens holds yet cost feels diffuse despite moon-silence escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the whispered rumor of hidden treasures, but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation—the tape reel discovery doesn't measurably alter tactics or deepen the visibility struggle. Cost of perpetual invisibility feels implied rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation test fails—no clear "when" until paragraph 3; closure lacks felt cost as transformation remains abstract ("she would begin") without tangible forfeiture or altered tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but conceptual cost ("weight of convergence") lacks visceral legibility; rain-trail pattern break reweights stakes yet final image avoids tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("changed her" implies humbling transformation), but cost legibility falters—no exact sentence crystallizes the price. Orientation anchors by 120 words, and Accumulative lens holds through density increase in sensory escalation. Missing one tightening that forecloses a path with tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation debt: harbor setting unclear past 120 words ("ivory harbor" undefined), triggering -0.4 penalty; accumulative lens holds but disorientation doesn't charge closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation test failed: "starlit vault in mist" remains vague past 120 words without payoff at closure. Accumulative lens holds, but cost proof fails—the mist clearing is atmospheric, not personal; no legible sentence shows Emilia paying a tangible price for her knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis (tile's work "done," memories "given a voice") with conceptual cost—the entangled memories' permanence resonates through the whale song. But the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks meaningful escalation; transcription proceeds smoothly without pressure shifts or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure (Charged Poise with "I am what remains after goodbye") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—solar storm pressure doesn’t narrow options. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for weak causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with felt cost ("breach boundaries... get us caught") under Accumulative lens. Final image reweights ink pot’s meaning while maintaining textural pressure; cost legible in "uncertain future" and "risk" without softening.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails cost proof test: no legible price paid for texture collection beyond lamp fading. Earned Stasis potential undercut by lack of prior stakes—dawn's arrival isn't a foreclosed path but natural progression.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with "sense of clarity emerged," but cost remains abstract ("time was always in motion") rather than visceral; poison bottle label’s final reappearance charges the image yet lacks tangible consequence. Lens (Accumulative) holds cleanly through tidal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (worldview transformation), but "sense of triumph" lacks concrete price. Orientation test passed early, yet Accumulative lens escalation feels thin—density increase lacks pattern break beyond volume crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative lens holds with density increase in graffiti beats, but escalation lacks narrowing options—unity emerges without obstacles. Cost proof weak: foundation stone chip's significance told, not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works (enduring to capture images), but Patel's warning creates no meaningful pressure escalation. Cost remains abstract "melancholy" without concrete on-page price paid during the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure fails Cost Proof Test: mist clearing is atmospheric but not character-based cost. Ship's departure feels coincidental (Situational lens ambiguity), resolving the problem it didn't create. Orientation passes but closure lacks legible pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong orientation anchors outpost/lake by 120 words; closure achieves Charged Poise with crystallized options on the ice. But cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page (no tangible forfeiture or altered tactics).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with dawn's "sound of a town reborn" reconfiguring silence into renewal, but cost remains conceptual (patience) without tangible sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds via rhythmic density.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("deep sense of loss," "heavy heart"), but lens ambiguity (shifts between Accumulative and weak Causal) undermines escalation. "Unsnarling" lacks causal logic—no visible mechanics for how mind-focus alters energy—hindering pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test fails: no clear who/where/when by 120 words beyond vague "lighthouse prison." No discernible drive lens—neither causal progression nor accumulative density—and "before they found the bodies" is unearned foreshadowing. Closure lacks cost legibility; "pressed on" forecloses no path.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "mournful elation" crystallizing cost, but debt repayment causality remains abstract—no dramatized friction in the ghost bride's fading beyond atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks unmistakable cost proof; "weight of her task" is abstract, not felt.

Dawn completion lacks conceptual repricing as ruin-to-reverence shift remains asserted, not reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: "sense of pride" isn't a felt sacrifice. Orientation succeeds early, but Accumulative lens falters as pressure never tightens—no narrowing of options or deepening stakes. Cost proof test fails; no on-page image concretizes loss.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails: "thrill of excitement" shows zero cost or reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds, but rising sun/patrons exert no pressure; "futuristic nostalgia" claim isn’t charged by prior causality. No felt cost at ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lacks legible cost: conspiracies are "uncovered" but no visible sacrifice or consequence (e.g., "secrets would change history" is thematic assertion, not earned cost); lens ambiguity between Accumulative/Textural and Causal weakens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise at the dual reflection) lands with felt cost ("weight lifting"), but the Accumulative/Textural drive lens isn't solidified until the clearing scene (~350 words), risking mid-point ambiguity per guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: coral's glow crystallizes options with felt cost ("aching but hopeful"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through decryption sequence, but the anesthetic's role in enabling closure slightly softens the cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ephemerality of art), but "if only for a moment" lacks visceral legibility. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently with density increase toward final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Lena's exchange of certainty for curiosity crystallizes in the living mural's final image with conceptual cost ("world was a richer place"). Accumulative pressure builds through sound-wave density shifts, but the cost ("certainty crumbling") feels under-embodied; needed physical toll from the feedback loop to elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative lens holds with density buildup, but conceptual cost remains abstract future promise ("carrying message forward"). Orientation delayed past 120 words (thoughts-tax revealed paragraph 4), weakening causality anchor. Closure lacks felt price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost ("weight... begin to lift"), but escalation is static reflection-driven. Non-closure accumulation: two issues (no present-tense pressure, backstory overuse) → −1.5.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise but cost remains abstract; "task never truly done" is stated not dramatized. Wind chime vibration during song feels decorative rather than causal escalation under Accumulative lens. No exact image conveys loss—cost proof test fails despite conceptual stakes. Orientation solid but weak pressure reweighting.

    Orientation Test failure: no spatial anchors or character motivation by 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost; "achievement" is declared without on-page forfeiture or reconfiguration. Accumulative lens fails as density increase doesn't reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("paths emerged and disappeared in response to the world's constant change"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens falters slightly as the seed-trail mechanism feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    No legible cost at closure; "infinite possibilities" ending avoids Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orchestrated serendipity remains abstract concept without narrowing options or altering tactics under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise (verse etched, exile lifting) under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost remains abstract—no on-page moment where nostalgia ban's price manifests concretely during the dance. Pressure deepens via sensory density yet lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works for accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract ("urgency to capture moment") with no legible on-page price paid. Orientation solid (anchors by para 1), yet escalation fails: stone-throwing causes ripples that immediately still without narrowing options or altering tactics. Cost proof test fails—no exact image where consequence crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof test—the "weight of experiences" is narrated but never legibly paid through constrained action; reflection density doesn't deepen stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as vision fades to grotto patterns, but cost ("heart pounding") is told not shown—no visceral consequence alters her final stance. Strength: Accumulative lens holds as decorations/gauge deepen "serene upheaval" toward crystallized peace.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "sense of peace" and "work would be part of the estate’s legacy" lack visible or conceptual price. Lens (Accumulative) holds, but Earned Stasis isn’t charged—no foreclosed path or altered tactics despite revelations, violating Q2’s closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes options as mirrors clear to show "glimpses of worlds," but cost proof fails—no on-page consequence for borrowed heartbeat or success. Bells tolling drives escalation under Accumulative lens, yet breakthrough feels coincidental, not earned by agency.

    Orientation debt: vague "ancient terrace" fails anchor test by 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—delegates' hope is asserted, not earned through Elian's agency. Lens ambiguity (hybrid attempted but unresolved) undermines causality; celestial dance offers no pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise works with the restored ecosystem, but the cost is conceptual only—the philanthropist vanishes without sacrifice, and the map's mechanics lack causal demonstration ("using the map... to guide her" feels handwaved during the pivotal release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands under Accumulative lens but cost remains abstract—"fading echoes" lacks palpable consequence. No visible price paid for transformation; prism glow resolves tension without narrowing options. "Time it took was brief" undermines escalation, violating pressure coherence for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (structures as testament) lacks legible cost; "glowing" moth wing feels symbolic not earned. Accumulative lens holds but final image doesn't reweight fragility with undeniable pressure. No sentence makes cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with aurora celebrating preserved memories, but cost of self-forgiveness remains abstract—stated in reflection rather than dramatized with visible on-page consequence during the rope plucking climax.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "path had chosen them" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; storm escalation under Accumulative lens tightens thematic pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lacks legible cost: "universe forever changed" is declared but no felt price paid (e.g., physical toll, lost opportunity); Earned Stasis fails as astronomer gains everything without visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (irreversible worldview shift), but escalation lacks meaningful density increase under Accumulative lens. Humming-to-figures sequence feels like linear progression rather than pressure accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof: pursuers vanish when door closes with no consequence, and "weight lifting" is abstract. Renegotiation lacks visible trade-off, breaking causal linkage at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred (pressure builds through narrative density), but closure lacks legible cost: "peace wash over her" contradicts Earned Stasis requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks visible cost—Emilia gains clarity without sacrifice. Causality breaks as rope’s power emerges deus ex machina. Lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural intent undermined by unearned causal climax ("jolt of insight" without setup). No on-page proof of conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is Earned Stasis (balance restored), but cost is abstract—"delicate harmony" threatened, not paid. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via crack-pattern shifts, yet escalation lacks agency; cave "begins to change" passively. No Orientation Test penalty, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence showing sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight lift," moon's light), but causal escalation is passive (storm clearing); protagonist agency in pressure buildup is underdeveloped despite valid Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lyra's renewed purpose crystallizes options with felt cost (the "gravity of hopelessness" she carries forward).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands but cost proof test fails: "forever changed" is abstract, not legible on-page. Lens ambiguity ("prophecy" implies causal stakes unresolved by textural accumulation) prevents higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (waterfall, leaves, compass glow) tightens into Charged Poise closure where "uncertainly certain" path crystallizes stance; cost (surrendering control) is felt but not viscerally shown during device assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (peace with transformed regret) with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—realization about "weight of names" occurs off-page between "weeks turned into months" with no on-scene pressure shift.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of apology begin to lift") under Accumulative lens, but orchard destruction's conceptual cost remains abstract. Missing one persistent constraint shaping final tactics weakens high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost as Aria unifies cosmic fragments, but cost isn't pinpointable on-page; "fragments of her own being" implies transformation without showing its felt weight in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("clocks seemed to be keeping perfect time") lacks legible cost; dawn brings "satisfaction" without altered stakes or tactics. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof fails—no on-page sentence shows paid price for the counting ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "quiet wildfire burning brighter" is vague metaphor, failing Q2’s "cost proof test." Orientation is strong (anchored by para 1), but Accumulative lens suffers from undramatized stakes—no constraint shapes tactics, and the laser button’s "significance" remains untested.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (acknowledging the path's difficulty), but the Accumulative lens weakens causality—subway insights accumulate without narrowing options. Cost proof falters: "long and difficult" is stated, not viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "felt a sense of peace" shows no visible/felt cost for the "continuous cycle." Accumulative lens holds, but Charged Poise lacks undeniable pressure as operator faces no narrowing options or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.7)
    Orientation test failed: "blooming jetty" and archivist's role unclear past 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—no on-page sacrifice for "haunted euphoria," violating Q2 cost proof test. Lens (Accumulative) holds but closure inert.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (loneliness as ongoing process), but the Accumulative lens wavers—rumor chains lack causal mechanics. Cost proof test fails: no on-page image concretizes the price paid beyond Raven's internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "weeds... seemed like a necessary step" crystallizes stance with emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds via sensory thickening, but "contingent relationships" method feels tacked on without causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "volcanic tenderness" and archive "whispering" lack legible stakes or consequence. Accumulative lens intended but density never reweights promise motif; final message restates rather than reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("fragile entangled memories," "vulnerable to time") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by 100 words; pressure deepens via drumming cadence shift that narrows options to fleeting connection, though escalation lacks a decisive intensification beat beyond rhythmic crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through storm intensification and sensory density, but Charged Poise closure lacks legible cost: she gains validation without sacrifice. The "different energy building" feels abstract, failing the cost proof test for a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (stars twinkling as "value of light") lacks legible cost—dissipating "stillwater tension" is conceptual but feels unearned. Accumulative lens holds, yet no felt price anchors the reconfiguration at the pivotal ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) reweights meaning with conceptual cost (status quo lost), but escalation falters: rebellion succeeds magically with no on-page obstacles. Critical flaw: cost remains abstract—"forests of second thoughts" lack legible price in final beat (e.g., no sacrificed relationships or personal toll).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens, but cost ("shedding past burdens") remains abstract without visceral on-page evidence at the swim's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "stillness both profound and unsettling" crystallizes the emotional void with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density of "remade hush" imagery without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolved boundaries), but "ban lifts" setup lacks tangible stakes payoff. Lens (Accumulative) holds, yet causal progression of artistic liberation feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise (courtyard as "testament to imperfection"), but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page—the painter pays no price for his insight. Accumulative lens holds, yet density fails to tighten stakes; "bartered awakenings" concept never faces tangible test.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation failure: "power grid stabilized" appears past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff; no closure with cost—ending ("simply smiled") shows static contemplation, not Earned Stasis or Charged Poise; Accumulative lens fails as sensory density never reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with stars intensifying and maker feeling "oneness," but the cost ("subdued light") remains conceptual rather than legible on the page. Orientation is solid, yet felt stakes lack tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise at dawn) lacks cost proof: no on-page sentence concretely shows sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost ambiguity prevents higher band despite atmospheric cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is valid Charged Poise with crystallized options ("sense of closure"), but cost isn't legible on-page—no specific sentence shows the price paid for transformation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase, though pattern break lacks causal testing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works but cost feels conceptual rather than visible; river stone warmth lacks tangible sacrifice to ground the "shape of hope" preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "convictions reshaped like a river" offers poetic resolution but no visible price paid for shedding assumptions; the "con revealed" backstory remains unexplained, undermining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric deepening, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in "weight of quest settling," yet causal agency remains passive.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation fails: no temporal anchor by 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—"weight lifting" is abstract with no on-page proof of change. Two distinct non-closure issues (orientation + cost ambiguity) trigger -1.5 cap, preventing higher score despite Accumulative lens holding.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as creativity barriers dissolve, but cost remains conceptual ("mist evaporating") without concrete forfeiture; Accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks sufficient pressure buildup before the dissolution beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise works (re-solidifying at dawn), but cost of dissolution remains conceptual, not legible—no sentence shows Asa paying price for merging. Lens (Accumulative) holds, but cost proof test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolution of reality boundaries), but cost proof fails—no specific sentence makes cost legible ("perspective shifted" is abstract). Escalation lacks pressure; translocation occurs passively without narrowing options or trade-offs under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with "trepidation and anticipation" at the shore, but cost remains conceptual ("unknown challenges") not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: snow clearing crystallizes silence's reconfiguration from burden to strength with conceptual cost ("price of their own voice"). Lens is Accumulative/Textural, but "nerve regeneration" ambiguity undermines causality early. Cost proof lands via "silence was no longer oppressive," though medical metaphor muddles stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost (pretender’s exposed facade), but causality frays: pretender’s arrival feels coincidental, not driven by Kael’s cryptic messages. Constellation timeframe lacks tactical pressure—no narrowing of options before climax. Orientation clear early (temple library established by para 1).

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—"truth not in maps but rhythms" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase; pressure plateaus without meaningful deepening past midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens—the final image of stars refracted through opera glasses reweights rebellion's meaning with conceptual cost of insignificance—but the felt price of her insignificance confrontation lacks visceral specificity in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: embryo retrieval brings "warmth" not sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but pressure never escalates meaningfully—plants' agitation doesn’t hinder action. No price paid for decoding or unsealing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails cost proof test: no on-page legible cost for the "unshakeable sense" ending. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Situational) persists past midpoint, violating gate rules. Orientation test passed but closure invalid.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (time's mystery accepted), but orientation falters: "wind-carved encampment" lacks spatial specificity past 120 words, muddying tactical constraints; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet causality feels passive (drone "darted ahead" vs. Kael's agency).

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise (monitoring screens as conversation unfolds) lands with conceptual cost ("difficult to control"), but causal lens wobbles: dormant networks appear deus ex machina without prior setup, weakening escalation logic at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis (she renounces her father's path), but escalation fails: the tower's chaos never pressures her oasis.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with atmospheric reconfiguration, but cost is invisible—no legible sacrifice for the goddess's echo. Orientation is strong, yet Accumulative lens suffers from static pressure; vibrations intensify but don't narrow options or alter tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "orbits of regret begin to dissipate" as mist clears, crystallizing Adelaide's stance with conceptual weight on legacy transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise (dawn peace) lands with felt cost of lifted guilt, but amber's glow lacks causal link to resolution; lens ambiguity at midpoint (-0.3) caps score despite solid Accumulative/Textural escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in the transformed "lilac unease," but escalation lacks protagonist agency—tile falls coincidentally, mandala "reveals" truths passively, failing cost proof test as no exact line shows paid price beyond vague unease.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence/image shows price paid for renaming (e.g., physical exhaustion, social risk). Closure (Charged Poise attempt) lacks felt cost despite "weight of mission" telling. Lens (Hybrid) holds but cost invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (dawn realization), but cost remains abstract—"catalyst" phrasing avoids felt sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, yet the static shock's "recalibration" feels coincidental not earned. Missing tangible price paid for new creative path.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) fails cost proof test: "darkness was no longer daunting" states rather than shows cost. Accumulative lens holds, but final image lacks undeniable pressure—contentment washes over her without tangible sacrifice. Missing on-page cost legibility caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost in "unearthed silence," but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—button cataloging never creates tangible pressure. Orientation clear early ("amber warehouse beneath towering cliffs"), yet accumulation never deepens stakes beyond description.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise works (mist clearing, walking together), but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; "weight lifting" lacks concrete on-page manifestation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mist/snow pattern, though escalation lacks tightening pressure before the self-meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens—the fog clearing crystallizes the cost of waiting ("patience worn smooth") with the final lapping water echoing eternity. Orientation anchors firmly by 100 words, and lens consistency elevates the resonant reconfiguration despite minimal causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: the wasteland's perceived "less desolate" state is subjective, not a felt forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but density fails to reweight stakes with tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise (city wrapped in tranquility) but cost remains conceptual—"fleeting nature of life" is stated, not shown through tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (coalescing understanding) with conceptual cost in "fragility" theme, but cost legibility falters—no specific on-page sentence where sacrifice crystallizes beyond vague "weight lifting." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as valid Charged Poise: Lena's paradigm shift ("thread... to be created") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost, crystallizing options through the twig's integration. Accumulative lens holds via sensory accumulation to the installation's reveal. Minor deduction as cost legibility lacks physical manifestation in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—disturbances "dwindle" without sacrifice. Causal lens holds but cost proof test fails; no on-page price paid for vigilance. Orientation solid but cost invisibility caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Conceptual Repricing: "key" as insight) lacks legible cost—wistful rebellion feels abstract, not visceral. Spatial mutiny occurs via deus ex machina without buildup. Lens (Hybrid) holds but cost proof test fails: no concrete image anchors sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the ribbon-tucked departure crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible cost ("thaw a part of the detective's heart"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (dread crystallizing her resolve) with felt cost, but "spongey dread" remains abstract—no concrete image to anchor the conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds, yet escalation lacks pressure tightening beyond atmospheric thickening.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure fails the cost proof test: the fiddler's "weight lifting" and "world unfolding" depict relief without legible sacrifice, violating Earned Stasis requirements; hitchhiker disappearance remains an untested backstory echo rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Charged Poise closure works but orientation test fails: "dusky sky" anchor arrives at 127 words, past 120-word limit, capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lacks legible cost: Lyra's renewed purpose shows no sacrifice or altered tactics. Accumulative lens holds but "midnight solace" resolution feels unearned without concrete price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Achieves Accumulative/Textural closure via Conceptual Repricing (mirror=soul revelation), but cost remains abstract. No on-page sentence makes stakes tangible—revelation changes nothing materially for the druid.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise (stepping into unknown) lands with conceptual cost of infinite possibility, but "possibilities are endless" weakens felt stakes. Orientation succeeds early, yet vague "after the future arrived early" fails to concretely pressure choices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("darkness still there, but no longer overwhelming"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density builds to the card's reconfiguration, with the orchard's transformation making the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost of "after tomorrow disappears," but orientation fails: unclear who/where at 120 words despite poetic vagueness. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet no pressure buildup precedes the crystallized ending.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lacks legible cost: "dissolved walls" is asserted not dramatized; Accumulative lens fails as "latent radiance" repetitions accumulate texture without reweighting stakes or altering tactics in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ongoing journey), but cost legibility falters—exact moment of sacrifice ("weight of secrets lifted") feels abstract rather than viscerally earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (watch's ticking, mist parting), but "forever changed" overstatement weakens legibility; lens (Accumulative) holds though causality gaps linger in watch's function.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "pulse synchronizing" is vague, not a felt/conceptual price. Orientation debt resolved by payoff (canyon hum central to closure), but accumulation fails to tighten stakes—dust layers without altering skimmer’s static tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "renewed purpose" is stated but no visible sacrifice or consequence shown. Mist walking/unstrapping lacks meaningful tension, resolving conflict through convenient discovery rather than agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise at lantern window) lacks on-page cost—Kael gains revelation without forfeiture, endurance, or tactical shift; Accumulative lens holds but cost proof test fails at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lacks felt cost: "stars fading but essence captured" soft-resets pressure without dramatized consequence. Two distinct non-closure issues (soft reset + undramatized burden) apply -0.8 cap. Orientation solid but Earned Stasis fails due to unearned "sense of pride" contradicting prior weight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds but cost proof fails: no legible forfeiture or endurance cost in closure beat. History-rewriting backdrop creates disorientation debt despite early anchors, weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost (exhaustion, bittersweet permanence), but hourglass redundancy ("after the final grain slips...") breaks causality in pivotal beat, triggering Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("weight lifted") without on-page sacrifice. Mist clearing reconfigures meaning yet lacks felt price—where is the irreversible loss?

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is valid Charged Poise (new creation crystallizes options) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost proof fails: "trepidation" lacks legible felt/conceptual price. Orientation clear early, but lens ambiguity at climax ("penny drops" vs transformation) caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation anchors instantly ("twilight descended, mist-clad atrium"). Closure is Earned Stasis (Aria's continued work) with felt cost (woman's tears subsiding = emotional price paid). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: mist clearing reweights stakes via density shift. Cost proof weak—"grip relaxed" shows relief, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with physical cost ("gasping with sudden change in pressure"), but the gold fleck illuminant's role is underdeveloped, weakening causal escalation at the chamber sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with cost in shard release, but causality breaks: ink patterns magically reveal ghost without struggle. Escalation fails—snow depth and radio static don't tighten options, violating Accumulative lens requirements for density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: storyteller's voice fading into echoes with diamond's transformation shows conceptual cost. Orientation anchors immediately; accumulative lens (density/pattern shift) holds through closure without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Accumulative/Textural Charged Poise fails cost legibility: "newfound purpose" lacks visible sacrifice. Wind bells' return charges final image but no felt price anchors the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—peace replaces stakes. Orientation failure: who/where/when unclear past 120 words, capping Q3 at 7.0. Accumulative lens holds but deepening doesn't narrow options or charge final image with tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.3)
    No closure with cost: the "endless pursuit" ending avoids decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration. Charged Poise fails as the final image ("dream that shone brightly") offers no reweighted stakes or felt cost—only cyclical repetition of the dawn ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation Test fails: "shadowed nexus" remains unanchored past 120 words, harming spatial coherence. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("releasing a piece of themselves"), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative pressure weakens during hair-unlocking beat.

    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—uncertainty is declared but not embodied in the final image. The "weight of her task" remains metaphorical; no concrete price paid on the page for the resolve to recover memories.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise (reversing exile "first step" with eased tension as cost) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost legibility falters—the "quiet triumph" lacks visceral stakes despite atmospheric pressure. Lens holds cleanly through sensory density escalation, though orientation anchors library/POV early without debt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no price paid for restoration beyond vague "deep peace." Orientation clear early, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Situational) weakens escalation; "parched earth" problem resolves without tangible struggle or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("silence she accumulated" as "gentle disturbance"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact sentence shows sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds, yet orientation anchors (prism sanctuary's rules) lack clarity past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.3)
    Orientation fails at 120 words (no temporal anchor beyond "rainy day"); closure lacks legible cost—peaceful resolution ("found a piece of herself") contradicts Accumulative lens requiring density shift with felt consequence. Rain's role as pressure source remains passive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost in final snow globe image, but orientation falters—Eli's expertise isn't anchored until paragraph 3, weakening early causality. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet isn't clearly taught before midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise ("courtyard forever changed") under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page. No exact sentence shows tangible sacrifice, failing cost proof test despite atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise (spire reconfigured as "sanctuary") lands with conceptual cost, but the price isn't legible on-page—the "sense of peace" contradicts expected anguish. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, yet escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; discoveries happen to Elara, not through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lacks legible cost: "spooled wholeness" realization feels unearned as Lyra passively observes calming clouds with no sacrifice; orientation is clear but Accumulative lens fails cost proof test at ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with "fleeting instant of beauty that would soon be lost," but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Hybrid) prevents 8.8+; demolition clock tightens stakes sufficiently though causal links feel thin.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (Eli ready to sail into unknown) with felt cost in "sociable isolation" contrasted against crew's exhaustion. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern-density buildup to crystallized decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is Charged Poise (Kael's cosmic connection), but conceptual cost ("fragile world") remains undramatized. Orientation solid, yet Accumulative lens falters—pressure lacks density increase; discovery sequence feels linear rather than intensifying, with no narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.9)
    Orientation debt: "settlers" identity unclear until paragraph 3 (~180 words), violating the 120-word anchor rule with no disorientation payoff. Closure is vague celebration without felt cost—energy "shifts" but no visible consequence or constraint reconfiguration. No causal linkage between chalk messages and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (enduring vigilance), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure accumulates atmospherically without narrowing options or altering tactics under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with glowing labyrinth guiding travelers, but cost remains conceptual (untested frost deadline). Blueprint discovery lacks causal motivation—triggered by nut without prior setup—compromising lens coherence. Orientation clear but midpoint lens ambiguity weakens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lacks legible cost: "spirit renewed" negates grief's weight without showing sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds but final image ("messy and beautiful place") states theme rather than reconfiguring stakes through action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (preserving bottle) holds under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility falters—restraint lacks felt consequence beyond "renewed determination." Orientation anchors by line 3, yet the "quantifying absence" method never concretely alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Elara's endurance at the pavilion forecloses path with visceral cost ("memories swirling within her"). Orientation delayed past 120 words (no who/where anchor until sensory details), but disorientation pays off in tidal pool revelation. Accumulative lens holds through memory density buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.7)
    No on-page closure: silos "seemed to be bridging gaps" is hopeful summary, not earned change. Cost invisible; dawn resolution lacks felt consequence. Orientation anchors clear but drive lens (Accumulative) fails at closure without reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis through moonlit restoration, crystallizing Elara's transformation. But cost remains abstract ("changed her," "newfound purpose") without visceral on-page legibility—violating Q2 cost proof test despite strong Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) has conceptual cost ("weight of discovery") but legibility fails—"responsibility" remains vague without specific forfeiture. Non-closure accumulation: two distinct issues (cost abstraction + gravity inversion underutilized as mere plot device) cap score.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (silence persists but is transformed), valid under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure accumulates through music's spread from trees to creatures, reweighting the dominant stake. Weakness: escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options; the "analysis" deepening feels preordained rather than earned through struggle. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    No legible cost anchors closure; "weight of exile lifting" contradicts promised stakes, violating Q2's cost proof test where final image lacks visible sacrifice for renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building toward Charged Poise closure, but cost remains abstract ("lessons she would carry") without on-page legibility. Orientation anchors (workshop/stars/fireworks) established cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation succeeds (Elyria established by para 1), but closure lacks legible cost. "Impact was lasting" tells rather than shows consequence; final image of flourishing spirit reads as soft reset. Cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence evidencing price paid for wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation fails at 120 words (unclear planetary rules/location anchors), costing 0.4. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost ("never see the orchard... same way again"), but gravity countdown pressure isn't meaningfully tracked as a live clock despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("secrets would stay with her") reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual without unmistakable on-page dramatization. Orientation succeeds early, yet cost proof test fails—no specific image conveys sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("memory of the experience lingered"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) weakens escalation; "sculpted hush" unfettering lacks specific forfeiture beyond sheet wear.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Charged Poise closure with driftwood markers pulsing as cosmic stillness crystallizes, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—static ritual without narrowing options. Cost ("felt changed") remains abstract despite vivid final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost remains atmospheric rather than character-specific. Vanishing stars create pressure yet fail to manifest tangible forfeiture; the stakes never concretely narrow Echo's options beyond vague "urgency."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the final image reweighting wonder's cost, but the felt sacrifice remains abstract ("sense of peace" lacks tangible forfeiture); orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 yet cost proof feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    No discernible drive lens: "shifted hush" and "truthful lies" are reiterated concepts, not causal/accumulative pressure. Critical failure—closure declares transformation ("change her life forever") with zero dramatized cost or altered stance; "truth" remains untested assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with the raveling silence becoming a bridge, but cost feels conceptual not visceral. Escalation lacks one decisive intensification beat; puzzle assembly creates gentle rhythm but no narrowing of options under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "azure defiance" and sword success show triumph without visible sacrifice or altered state; Charged Poise undermined by absence of legible price for transformation despite "felt cost" claims; lens (Hybrid) holds but cost gap breaks Q2 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands conceptually but cost remains unlegible—final transformation summarized ("senses reeling") rather than dramatized. Accumulative lens holds via density escalation, yet protagonist's passivity undermines causal pressure in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (resolve to protect the lighthouse), but the cost of the lamp’s failure remains felt rather than visible; the sea glass’s final glow lacks tangible consequence beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise (dawn arrival) lacks legible cost; "weight of responsibility" is stated not dramatized. Orientation succeeds early but escalation fails—no meaningful tightening of options or knowledge shift under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but fails cost proof test—no exact moment where conceptual price becomes legible. Sunset observation passively happens to protagonist rather than arising from agency, violating Accumulative escalation requirement for density increase with cost. Lens ambiguity at midpoint weakens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost (sorrow dissipation → mundane miracles), but lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3) caps high-band eligibility. Storm/moon pattern break reweights stakes cleanly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails cost proof test: realm "begins to heal" with no visible sacrifice. "Renewed determination" lacks legible price under Accumulative lens; Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure, but darkness recedes without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise at dawn) lands with felt cost but lacks causal buildup; the backstory mistake never pressures present choices, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens. The "truth in the journey" ending resonates yet feels unmoored from on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "tenuous absolution" is repeatedly stated but never tested or paid for. Accumulative lens holds yet density increase lacks conceptual reweighting—bread's mystery unresolved without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks concrete cost proof; "fading illusions" implies loss but no on-page forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost remains abstract despite quartz hush motif.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no on-page evidence for "at what cost?" beyond abstraction. Two non-closure issues (vague cost + no persistent constraint) trigger -1.5 cap. Orientation solid but causality falters as sunrise resolves tension coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "futuristic nostalgia" is abstract, not felt/conceptual price. Orientation clear early but climax fails cost proof test—no on-page sentence anchors sacrifice for her paradigm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Valid Charged Poise closure as transformed lock crystallizes creative rebirth, but cost remains abstract ("weight begin to lift") without concrete on-page forfeiture; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but "cost proof" fails—perseverance through heat/smoke is summarized, not dramatized with visible sacrifice; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but cost legibility weakens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with locket display note, but mailbox mystery escalation relies on convenient exposition ("mailman revealed...") rather than causal narrowing of options; cost of writer’s loss remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the escape into light, but cost remains nebulous—no tangible price (time lost, emotional toll) is legible on the page despite the spider’s web completion, undermining escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise (smiling at future secrets) lacks legible cost—no sentence pinpoints emotional or conceptual price paid. Whale-triggered gravity shift establishes causal chain, but coffee grounds method feels retrofitted without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("never see the world the same way again"), but meteor shower's fading feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven escalation under accumulative lens. Interrogation beat lacks sufficient buildup—student's answer flows too easily without complicating the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works under Accumulative lens, but cost ("doubts dissipate") lacks visceral legibility—no concrete tradeoff or persistent constraint shapes tactics. "Ghostly resolve" image charges the ending, yet the memory confrontation yields only abstract relief without felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: "sense of peace" replaces concrete sacrifice. Auroral peak signals climax but no pressure escalation occurs; "calibrated treason" concept remains undramatized despite early setup. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    No felt cost at closure: dawn brings peace, not sacrifice. "Journey continues" undermines Earned Stasis; unresolved mystery isn't closure without foreclosed path. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation fails: "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" concept isn't anchored within 120 words, muddying comprehension.

Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through patterned firefly/moon imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) valid under Causal lens but cost proof fails—no legible price paid for discovery beyond conceptual "complexity." Dust storms heighten atmosphere but never constrain tactics or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.3)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "disappeared into the dawn" offers triumphant legacy without legible sacrifice. Orientation debt past 120 words (no concrete who/when anchors) triggers -0.4 penalty. Lens ambiguity (hybrid/accumulative) undermines pressure coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure: "heart a little lighter" crystallizes stance with felt cost of isolation; music box's fade-to-write sequence tightens pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands but cost proof fails: no on-page sacrifice, only "satisfaction." Lens ambiguity hurts—Accumulative/Textural pressure lacks density increase; causal links (key→resonance) feel underdeveloped. Orientation solid but closure image dulled by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("fragile peace... might shatter"), but paraphrase loops ("I felt a sense of windborne solace... I felt my heart respond") and late thematic echo ("reminder to cherish every moment") constitute two distinct non-closure issues requiring -1.5 deduction under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sentinel's realization about "destined mismatches" crystallizes options with cost embodied in the burned letter fragment clutched in her hand during the final amber-lit contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)

    Closure as Charged Poise works (sprout symbolizing rebirth amid ruins), but cost remains abstract—rebellion's price isn't concretely felt despite celestial alignment fading. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through sensory build.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing fails cost proof test—the adaptation revelation alters nothing practically. Resolution relies on coincidence (workers' riddle) rather than protagonist agency. No visible price paid for the discovery despite thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.9)
    Closure fails cost proof test: final gratitude lacks legible price ("secrets revealed" is thematic echo, not earned consequence). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) collapses as sensory details don't constrain choices—ritual described via summary ("began to walk," "leaving objects") not dramatized action. No meaningful tightening; pressure evaporates when streetlights "flickered to life" without altering Eli's path. Missing causal link between shard and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost (abandoned certainty), but ampoule revelation arrives deus ex machina without prior causality. Structural weakness insight lacks setup, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building pressure, but closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—phrases like "weight of obsession" remain vague. Orientation is solid (staircase established by line 3), but "rupture" beat fails to reconfigure stakes as required; cost proof test fails with no on-page cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) fits Accumulative lens but cost remains conceptual ("smog receded") without felt trade-off. Critical failure: zero escalation—no narrowing of options or deepening pressure beyond static internal resolve. Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies for two distinct issues (weak cost, no escalation).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with "weight settling like a mantle" crystallizing Elena's commitment, but cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through ice thaw cadence shift reweighting cultural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal lens holds cleanly but closure lacks legible cost: radiance fades yet no specific sacrifice shown (e.g., "bleak exhilaration" contradicts hopeful transformation). Yoyo resolution summarized ("puzzle finally yielded") without dramatized struggle, undermining escalation. Orientation clear by 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory escalation, but closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost. "Forever marked" is abstract; no specific price paid beyond psychological unease. Orientation solid early.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost under Accumulative lens. "Chest heaving" is physical exertion but no reweighted stake—cloud interpretation succeeds effortlessly. Blue hour deepening doesn't constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with "watchers watched" crystallizing options, but cost remains abstract ("weight settling") without specific on-page manifestation. Accumulative lens holds through dread accumulation, yet crack-triggered map discovery feels passive rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (sunlight on dust motes) with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks tangible pressure. Ivy's "relaxing" feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative vs Hybrid), capping score despite valid Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "hushed blaze" metaphor but lens instability undermines escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("she had been changed"), but cost proof fails—no embodied image shows transformation, only abstract statements. Orientation perfect, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens causality at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative lens holds with sensory density tightening stakes, but closure lacks causality: "grief begin to unfold" feels unearned without prior struggle. Cost ("luminous torment") legible yet decoupled from action—release of crane doesn't alter tactics. Valid Charged Poise RR but missing escalation through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure attempts Charged Poise but lacks concrete cost—crystal’s "otherworldly energy" feels unearned. Orientation is clear (wedding wreckage → observatory), but "unused potential" remains abstract, failing cost proof test at ending.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Lena's cosmic connection epiphany reconfigures the "frequency" with felt cost (solitary journey's emotional toll). But cost legibility falters—trepidation vanishes too neatly into belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure fails cost proof test: final resolve ("she would uncover truth") lacks legible cost; "sieved hush" remains thematic echo without reconfiguring options; lens ambiguity (textural → causal) undermines payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise (drawer pull in pocket) lacks visible cost; "mist closed in" is atmospheric but fails cost proof test. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Causal) weakens escalation despite parapet anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: "backlash of regrets would always be there" forecloses denial while accepting tools to navigate. Accumulative lens holds, but the "flickering flame" metaphor slightly obscures the felt cost's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Valid Charged Poise closure under Accumulative lens: mist clearing crystallizes options with visible cost (past weight lifting). But lens ambiguity early ("labyrinth" metaphor introduced mid-scene) nearly triggers cap; cost proof ("weight lifting") feels abstract, not concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Charged Poise closure succeeds but cost lacks concrete legibility; "strange sensation" remains abstract rather than an undeniable image like the luminescent figure, failing cost proof test under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "lost time accumulates in spaces between memories" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost in the saucer's crack symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Aurora's dissolution, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—the "perilous journey" claim contradicts smooth stitching progression. Cost (her fading) legible yet insufficiently earned by prior pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands (Aria's crystallized understanding of cosmic connection), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Prophecy resolution feels coincidental, violating Situational lens guardrails; old woman's appearance lacks causal buildup. Non-closure accumulation cap applies: two distinct issues (unearned prophecy + abstract cost) → -1.5 from base 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—final "road ahead fraught with danger" is abstract telling, not dramatized consequence. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof fails per Q2 gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lacks visible cost—revelation brings "completion" without sacrifice. "After friction disappears" premise is stated but never pressures choices; the aurora fading is poetic but not a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: masks slipping with visible cost ("confront the truths she had hidden") crystallizes her stance. Storm dissipation parallels internal shift, but escalation lacks tangible pressure—vigil remains static observation rather than tested endurance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in physical exhaustion and thematic realization, but the "hidden overture" concept lacks causal integration—sundial angles inform arguments only via telling, not demonstrable cause/effect during the duel's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("city not yet saved"), but stakes remain abstract—no on-page resistance pressure tests the poet's resolve. Moonrise timeframe creates gentle escalation but no narrowing of options; rebuilding feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation failure: "tidal arbor above the clouds" remains spatially unanchored past 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost in "steely longing" and frozen clock, but lens ambiguity early nearly caps score. Accumulative pressure holds at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lacks legible cost: monsoon transforms from threat to purification without sacrifice, and "luminous doubt" resolves to "deep conviction" via assertion rather than earned struggle. Orientation is clear early (ridge/seed/monsoon deadline), but causal escalation stalls—urgency declared but never concretely tested through obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative lens holds but cost remains abstract; "weight lifted" lacks concrete legibility. Orientation clear early, but closure (compass release) feels unearned without prior struggle escalation.
