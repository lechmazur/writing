  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit is present: Maria begins examining dust, reflects on patterns, and ends still reflecting with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that creates a before/after with cost. The piece follows an accumulative lens but fails to deliver the required tightening or deepening—pressure never escalates, and the final image merely restates the opening meditation. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when established early), but the absence of on-page closure with felt cost is disqualifying. The lens (accumulative/textural) is held but never pays off with a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the piece lacks a legible drive lens—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught by midpoint, creating drift between lyric description and vague discovery. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the artist claims new purpose), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture, no option foreclosed on the page. The ledger strip discovery and frost observation do not narrow tactics or change knowledge in a way that alters her stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (survivor, Eli), where (winterglass conservatory), and when (post-catastrophe silence) anchor by the fourth paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the heat-map device and tuning fork vibrations layer atmosphere, but no causal because/therefore linkage tightens options. The ending offers Charged Poise—the "symphony of silence" and the survivor carrying the music forward—but the cost is asserted ("no longer alone") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The closure unit exists but lacks the undeniable pressure or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture is signaled by the lyric tone, but the piece also attempts causal escalation (package → journey → reactivation → peace). Orientation anchors arrive within tolerance. However, closure lacks visible cost: the undertaker's peace is asserted in the final paragraphs without a decisive change, renunciation, or reweighted stakes legible on the page. The "years passed" summary evacuates agency from the ending, leaving only atmospheric assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens with clear spatial anchors (arbor, ridge, lanterns) and situational context (sanctions, exile community). However, no decisive change, renunciation, or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page. Akira's final declaration and the community's agreement simply restate the opening premise without narrowing options or introducing felt cost. The ending summarizes her future readiness rather than dramatizing a moment that forecloses a path or reweights meaning. Closure form is absent; the story presents a static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation (who/where/when) anchors by paragraph three, avoiding the test penalty. However, closure lacks decisive cost: Aria "discovers" a path and feels peace, but no prior option is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no tactical constraint imposed. The pilgrim arrives, instructs, fades—pure convenience plotting. The "past life memory" and "unused love" remain abstract declarations never tested by on-page pressure. Under a Causal lens (evaluator-inferred), the because/therefore chain breaks: breathing exercises → vague connection → asserted understanding, with no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words and remains vague (who is Elian beyond a label, where precisely in the garden, what time window). The lens appears accumulative/textural by design, but no meaningful before/after legibility emerges—Elian begins studying hyperbolic geometry and ends studying it, with the fragment's "power" asserted rather than demonstrated through altered options. The closure image (gathering the fragment to weave into a maze) is told intent, not an on-page change with visible cost. The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of time"—is claimed but never tested or narrowed by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal progression (wall falls → liberator acts → seeds distributed) but key turns occur off-page or in summary ("worked to distribute," "as the seasons passed"). Closure lacks on-page cost—the liberator simply vanishes after success is declared in exposition. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague; the carnival center and vault never cohere spatially. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page; the "staggering grace" at the vault is told, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page escalation or reversal occurs; Lyra tinkers, recalls her mother, calibrates the prototype, and succeeds without obstacle. The "sound of trust breaking" materializes as a gift ("like a shattering of glass") rather than emerging from protagonist struggle or agency. The ending offers declarative summary ("her work was far from over," "always a way forward") in place of a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. Orientation is present (greenhouse, aurora, forge) but the piece remains a static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story opens with unclear orientation—Lumina's identity, purpose, and the station's significance emerge slowly through装饰ive descriptions rather than anchoring who/where/when by ~120 words (−0.4). No meaningful reversal occurs: Lumina spots a couple, notices flowers with a cryptic message, takes a photo, and leaves. The cryptic flower message does not alter options or impose a cost; it merely extends the existing quest. Closure is a Charged Poise attempt, but because no prior constraint was foreclosed and no cost is legible on the page, it reads as a vague setup for a sequel rather than a reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who (Elian), where (control room), and when (winter thaw) early enough. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Elian begins contemplative and ends contemplative with the same goal (craft safe zones) unchanged. The closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: finishing the orb and smiling does not foreclose a prior path or reconfigure stakes. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) would require a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake; instead, the narrative loops declarations of purpose without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: "who" (stunt double) and "where" (rusted library under stars) anchor by the opening lines, but "when" (after discovering you're not who you thought) remains vague past 120 words and never sharpens into a concrete timeframe that constrains choice—deduct −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (protagonist steps out of shadows with the seashell as talisman), but no visible cost is legible on the page: no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship or opportunity lost. The decryption beat offers a micro-turn ("the truth is in the shadows") but the final paragraph summarizes a shift in feeling rather than showing a decisive act or forfeiture. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is weak; under Accumulative, the pattern lacks a meaningful cadence shift or density spike at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure is asserted rather than dramatized: "the world was transformed" and "secrets now forever changed" tell transformation without showing a single altered option or felt price. The piece accumulates atmosphere but never tightens—listening, rising, walking, returning form a circular path with no because/therefore linkage or deepening that narrows choice. Orientation anchors who and where adequately early, but the timeframe "last star...dimming sky" appears once and never constrains action. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake at closure; the final paragraph returns to the opening's sandalwood-and-candles tableau unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The looped timelines are mentioned but never constrain a present choice or complicate tactics on the page; they function as backstory color. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding achieved), but no before/after options shift with felt cost—Zeta continues sweeping, gazing, and appreciating exactly as in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens weakly: density does not increase, and no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal linkage operates: the registrar walks, raises a lens, smiles, and leaves without any because/therefore pressure or motivated ellipsis that narrows options. The "closure" is a declared state ("she was free") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost on the page. The piece reads as a single static tableau with synonym churn ("mistrust melting," "transparency," "honesty") rather than escalation under any identifiable lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when anchor after ~120 words; "after luck became measurable" remains abstract and unexploited. The piece follows an Accumulative lens but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page—the dresser continues tending, polishing, and vanishing into shadows without foreclosing a path or crystallizing a stance. The ending offers atmospheric repetition ("the garden maze...stood as a monument") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material. No causal linkage or meaningful tightening; the narrative describes a static devotion across seasons without escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (xenobiology station, Kaelin, twilight repair task) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Kaelin touches the nexus, experiences sideways time, returns confirmed—qualifies as Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost is unclear: she gains data and excitement without visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The "reluctance" to return is mentioned but not dramatized, and her post-return state ("confident," "excited") shows no loss. The inferred lens (Causal) holds, but cost legibility at closure is weak, triggering the Cost proof test deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is established early (orchestra pit, flooded opera house), but no meaningful causal escalation occurs. Rachel discovers the program, tilts it to reveal markings, reads a hidden message, feels peace—each beat simply unfolds without resistance or narrowing options. The "code" resolves itself through water damage without Rachel making a choice that forecloses anything. The ending offers Charged Poise language ("forever changed") but no legible cost or before/after distinction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece sets up a quest for "hidden truth" but the closure—Aria grasping that truth is "provisional and ephemeral"—arrives through summary rather than on-page discovery with visible cost. The weather station setting and botanical illustration seed early but their causal linkage to the final realization is asserted, not dramatized through a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending states "auroral sorrow" and "weight of the swallowed truth" without an image or action that makes the cost legible on the page. Orientation is clear early; lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final reconfiguration lacks felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, closure is minimal: the explorer reads a logbook and feels "satisfaction" without visible cost or a decisive change in stance. The story operates in a loose accumulative mode—atmosphere, radio program, valve wheel, logbook—but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The "swallowed truth" is discovered off-page (in text) rather than forcing a choice that narrows options. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, and the ending simply stops rather than crystallizing a before/after with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The chronicle keeper's burrowing and the obsidian refuge's "regenerative silence" are described extensively but do not alter options or impose visible cost. Orientation is established early (library, catacombs), satisfying that test. However, closure fails: the final paragraphs offer only summary and thematic restatement ("crumbling peace," "regenerative power of silence") without an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Aria, Sage Ridge, twilight, guitar). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the eclipse ritual, keepsake curl, and Eli's arrival, culminating in a shared moment. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the eclipse peak charges the final image with connection and belonging—but the cost remains atmospheric and asserted ("fragile and easily lost") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or visible trade-off on the page. The ending reweights prior material via mood and image, meeting the RR threshold, yet lacks the sharp felt price that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test is satisfied early (silo library, Emilia as historian), but the piece lacks a coherent drive lens. The narrative reads as a leisurely tour through atmospheric description rather than causal progression or accumulative pressure toward a closure unit. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page; Emilia departs unchanged, carrying memories but without visible or felt cost. The "displaced axis" of the dragons is mentioned twice but never reweights options or meaning at closure, leaving the ending diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs. The Oracle "continues to write" with no visible cost, no foreclosed path, no felt pressure at closure—merely declarative summary ("their life would never be the same"). The encounter is stated to be transformative but never dramatized as such. Drive lens is indeterminate: elements suggest situational pressure (stranger arrives), but the piece delivers only summary loops and thematic echo without a coherent closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural attempted but underdelivered. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening lines, waiving that penalty. The closure unit—"the stillness...was beginning to unravel" followed by the priest's satisfaction—asserts completion without demonstrating a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page. The "possession...averted" appears as summary two paragraphs before the end, undercutting closure immediacy. No meaningful tightening or pattern break reweights the dominant stake; the ritual proceeds in a single register from start to finish. Cost is claimed ("he had played a small part") but never shown through a forfeited option or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure effect: the writer finishes the map and walks away with resolve, but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs. The ending declares transformation ("became the conductor") without dramatizing the moment of shift or the price paid. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but causality is thin—mapping memories does not narrow options or alter tactics on the page. The lens reads as intended Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delayed beyond 120 words and remain vague—"gravity defier" is a title without grounding, the viaduct's function is unclear, and the temporal frame "between the drop and the ripple" reads as metaphor without scene-level clarity. The piece attempts an accumulative/textural lens but delivers summary rather than pressure: "She confronted these echoes, integrating their experiences" tells transformation without showing a single dramatized encounter. Closure claims victory and transformation but no decisive choice, renunciation, or cost appears on the page—the world is simply "remade" by assertion in the final paragraphs. The inferred lens never coheres into clean causality or accumulative intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but no causal linkage drives the narrative—each paragraph offers a new poetic observation without because/therefore logic. The piece lacks a legible closure unit: Aria begins seeking relief from numbness and ends "at peace," but this shift occurs off-page between ornamental descriptions. No decisive change, renunciation with cost, or resonant reconfiguration is dramatized; the final image ("Aria was at peace") summarizes outcome rather than showing a moment that reweights prior material. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal turns, accumulative pressure, nor situational crystallization coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn who (storm recorder), where (courtyard), and the inciting object (message tube) across the opening paragraphs, but the "after being followed home" timeframe arrives only at line 10, creating mild disorientation. The closure offers no decisive change—she "stood up" and "walked away" with resolve, but no option is foreclosed and no visible cost appears on the page. The rogue quarantine zone discovery generates no on-page pressure or consequence; the protagonist contemplates in solitude without facing a test or trade-off. The piece reads as a single meditative scene under an Accumulative lens, but it delivers no pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the poet arranges stones, reflects on humanity's choices, feels wonder, and leaves—each beat restates mood without narrowing options or raising cost. Orientation is delayed (who she is, why this night, what changed) and the "energy beings" arrive as vague backdrop with no causal work. Closure reads as summary ("she would continue to pattern") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no visible price is paid and no prior material is reweighted. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4) and closure cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within bounds. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens—violinist wanders, encounters group, plays music—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the "chronic hush" lifts because the text declares it does, not through escalating pressure or a constraining choice. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration claim ("the chronic hush...was now a reminder of the beauty"), but the cost is not legible on the page: the violinist departs with a smile and lingering music, no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The lens wobbles between lyric description and a causal search without committing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost occurs. The dealer completes her task and departs; the grotto "waited" and "remained" in static description. The story presents a single extended tableau without a meaningful tightening, deepening, or reversal that narrows options or changes knowledge. Under any inferred lens (likely Accumulative/Textural given the atmospheric density), closure fails to land with felt or conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by line 2, no penalty. Drive lens reads Situational (chance meeting, serendipitous connection), but pressure never crystallizes into a stance with cost; the women simply agree to uplift contributors with no on-page obstacle or trade-off. The mistaken-envelope backstory arrives as retroactive explanation rather than lived causality. Closure lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—the final image ("their friendship, kindled under the stars, would continue to flourish") restates the premise without reweighting it or showing visible cost. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence makes sacrifice or foreclosed path legible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story summarizes years of activity rather than dramatizing a single pressurized window. Orientation is present but the drive lens remains unclear—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density governs the final paragraphs, which offer retrospective summary instead of on-page closure. The arbor's acceptance by the community is told, not shown, and no felt cost accompanies the resolution. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the ending beat makes sacrifice or foreclosure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the rooftop canal, city context, and Lyra's task emerge slowly without clear spatial or temporal anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure effect—"forever changed," art "infused with the essence of the infinite"—is declared but not demonstrated through a decisive on-page change in options, stance, or cost. The causal chain is weak: Lyra's spell succeeds without complication, the giant stirs as convenient backdrop, and the final image ("city's rhythm return to its normal cadence") resets rather than reconfigures. No meaningful tightening or deepening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (conjurer, cavern orchard, night ritual) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, ritual gestures, and thematic assertions toward a tonal shift ("buried optimism"). However, the closure—"a spark of understanding" and a contemplative walk away—lacks visible cost or a decisive reweighting of prior material; the "secrets revealed" via mosaic patterns is told, not shown, and the final image (conjurer vanishing, glass eyes watching) recycles mood without meaningfully reconfiguring stakes or knowledge established earlier. One transition (ritual begins, ritual ends, dawn arrives) but no meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: gathering fragments and arranging treasures to invite discovery. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise occurs on the page—the dweller's final disappearance mirrors the opening routine without foreclosing a path or reweighting the dominant stake. The ending asserts mythic presence ("whispered rumor") but does not dramatize a cost or consequence that reconfigures the dweller's options or the library's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the piece summarizes a transformation ("Emilia felt herself becoming more attuned") without a decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance. The storm season functions as ambient backdrop, not causal pressure that narrows options. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty, but the piece never moves from reflection to dramatized event. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) would require a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; instead, the prose loops through synonymous claims about growth across 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal lens: brooch discovery → marking investigation → stranger exchange → art creation. Closure lands as Decisive Change (the finished piece titled "Convergence" offers resolution), but cost is largely conceptual—"weight of the convergence bearing down"—and the final image ("otherworldly light") drifts toward mysticism rather than embodied consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (stranger's revelation connects brooch to convergence), but the climactic exchange is summarized, weakening causal grip at the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early enough. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds atmosphere and adds the pearl, then spirals through increasingly abstract meditations. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page. Aria's "realization" in the final third is asserted ("discovered a truth") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path or reweights prior material. The pilgrim's arrival functions as setup but never complicates or tests Aria's stance; the pearl amplifies her abilities without friction, and the ending offers thematic summary instead of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the story operates almost entirely in summary mode: years of collecting are told, installations "take shape" off-page, and the community's healing is recounted rather than dramatized. No decisive on-page reversal occurs; the valve purchase and installation sequence lack causal pressure. The ending offers declarative satisfaction ("she had done more than simply compile fragments") rather than a felt cost or reconfigured image, failing the closure test under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who Emilia is beyond a label, where she stands in relation to the world, and when this occurs remain vague past the opening third; the "hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is poetic but anchors nothing concrete. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative (mist, vault patterns, cracks forming arrows) but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Emilia walks, finds the fortress, emerges unchanged with knowledge summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) lands: the final paragraph asserts transformation and possibility without showing a single visible, felt, or conceptual cost that forecloses a path or reweights prior material. The narrative is outline sequencing ("as she walked," "with each step," "as she turned") without causal linkage or motivated ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is adequately anchored (tower, sea, autumn fog) within the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns on the tile, whale songs, and transcriptions layer toward a final reconfiguration. However, closure lacks visible cost—Emilia finishes her work, "felt a sense of peace settle," and the ending delivers thematic echo ("the memories that remained, entangled and forever connected") without a decisive alteration of stakes or a felt price. The Resonant Reconfiguration is asserted rather than dramatized on the page, and no option is foreclosed or path charged with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. However, the closure unit—Kael's realization about goodbye being transformation—lands as an asserted epiphany without dramatized cost; the story tells us Kael's boredom is replaced by awe but does not show a foreclosed path or visible price. The causal chain from fragment discovery to duplicate manifestation to thematic understanding reads as a sequence of escalating declarations rather than because/therefore pressure that narrows options. The drive lens appears causal but the final turn lacks the felt cost required for clean closure under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~200 words ("funeral home's director" clarifies setting late). The dominant stake (securing asylum for a client) is declared but never dramatized: the father's offstage negotiation and the director's unseen "reconsideration" deny the reader causal linkage. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("ready to make their move") but the cost remains hypothetical and the breach itself occurs offstage, leaving no visible or felt consequence on the page. The lens reads Causal but the "because/therefore" chain is missing at the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never deepens or tightens pressure; it circles the same texture-collection activity from start to finish. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only gradually across the opening paragraphs, breaching the ~120-word anchor window without taught pattern or payoff (−0.4). No closure unit is legible: the stationer ends exactly as she began, with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the final image merely restates her ongoing project without visible cost or reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract motion. The piece lacks a legible closure unit—no decisive change, no visible cost, no reconfiguration of stakes on the page. The final lines loop back to the opening frame ("labyrinth remained," "story was never truly complete") without reweighting prior material or landing a felt consequence. Under an attempted Accumulative lens, the ending deflates rather than crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed; we learn "myth buster" as a role but no name, and the spatial anchors drift between cliff edge, observatory halls, and an undefined "mystical realm" without clear transitions. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with a vague causal quest, but neither coheres at closure. The ending declares success ("unlocked the secrets") rather than showing a decisive change or felt cost on the page. No meaningful price forecloses a path; the protagonist simply wins, rendering closure asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening paragraph and the threat is signaled early, satisfying basic structure. However, the piece offers no on-page closure: the ending asserts that "residents stood ready" and Ava "would remain," but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs—the final lines summarize future intention rather than landing a cost-laden image or act. The drive lens reads Causal in setup but dissolves into summary, with no because/therefore linkage tightening options at the end. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat makes visible what Ava or the community has sacrificed or irreversibly altered.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is vague: "moonlit summit" during "the space age" with "dawnlit" lighting creates confusion about time of day and astronomical setting (moon's glow plus dawn plus space-age context suggests off-Earth, but flora "swaying gently in the breeze" contradicts airless lunar surface). The closure—Elara feels satisfied, packs up, descends—lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; she completes her mission as intended without foreclosing options. Causality is weak: Dr. Patel's warning that flora is "on the verge of disappearing forever" does not create new pressure or narrow choices. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies for unclear spatial and temporal anchors past 120 words, and the Q3 cap at 7.0 is triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn Emilia is blind only after several paragraphs of repair-shop action, and the depot's spatial anchors remain vague throughout. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with the drone calibration, light refraction, and ship departure layering atmosphere, but no meaningful tightening or reversal occurs—Emilia adjusts, then succeeds, with no visible cost or foreclosed option. The closure image (drone flying, mist clearing) reconfigures nothing; it simply confirms success without felt consequence. The coincidental ship departure is noted as "auspicious" but does not complicate or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-quest with Accumulative texture, but the closure unit is absent: Emilia walks onto the ice toward an off-page convergence with no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The pattern on the glass is cracked as a puzzle but does not reweight prior stakes or foreclose a path with visible cost—she simply continues her journey. Orientation anchors (outpost, frozen lake, Emilia) arrive early, waiving that penalty, but the ending delivers anticipation rather than closure. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a price paid or option foreclosed at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: footsteps accumulate, the fork hums, cobblestones stir. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands with visible cost—the town "begins to respond" and is "reborn" via assertion, not dramatized pressure. The ending declares transformation without showing a before/after that the reader can trace through concrete action or forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but causality is thin—Kael's success in "untangling" and "harnessing" is asserted via summary rather than dramatized through reversals or obstacles that test her method. The temple's energy "responds" without resistance, and the climax ("with a final burst of energy, Kael succeeded") skips the peak moment entirely, summarizing the outcome instead of showing the decisive act. Closure form is unclear: the device preserves memories, but no before/after choice or felt cost is legible—Kael waits for rescue with "bittersweet" reflection, not a path foreclosed or stance crystallized with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive by the opening paragraph, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout—touches of accumulative texture clash with attempted causal pressure ("driven to uncover them all") that never narrows options. No on-page closure: the boy stands at a locked door contemplating possibilities; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The final phrase "before they found the bodies" introduces a timeframe element without dramatizing its cost or integrating it causally. Lens ambiguity at closure triggers −0.4 and cap at 7.2; absent closure lands the score in the 3–4 band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who-where-when anchors arrive by paragraph one, but "when" remains abstract ("endless night," "hush of winter-cracked fields"). The closure unit—alchemist gains mastery, ghost bride fades—occurs on the page but lacks visible cost; the "debt slowly being repaid" is summary, not a decisive forfeiture or trade-off the reader witnesses. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (luminous atmosphere, recurring bead imagery) but the final paragraphs loop thematic restatements without deepening pressure or reweighting prior material. The alchemist's discovery happens through lucky contact with the bead rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit appears on the page. The story loops through decorative description of Aria's weaving without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the tapestry glows, dawn arrives, and the narrator summarizes thematic hope in place of dramatized cost. Causality is replaced by synonym churn: "the threads weaving together" → "fabric began to glow" → "creation took shape" with no because/therefore linkage or price paid. The final paragraphs offer meta-commentary ("a testament to the power of art") rather than an image that reweights prior material. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when anchors emerge gradually across the first 15% without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern, and the delay does not serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with cost. Maya completes the excavation and "felt a sense of pride"—no decision narrows options, no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The narrative reads as pure summary across weeks ("days turned into weeks") with no causal linkage or decisive change at the end. Orientation is present early (who/where), but the accumulative lens never crystallizes a final image that reweights prior material. The ending paragraph asserts restoration without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (arcade, dawn, Cipher on bench). The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—Cipher seals the letter and vanishes into the crowd without visible cost or altered options. The piece reads accumulative/textural in aspiration but lacks a pattern break or cadence shift at closure that reweights the stake. The inferred lens (Accumulative) is not held; the final beat asserts continuation ("journey had just begun") rather than crystallizing pressure or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "where, when, who" anchor by ~120 words but the embroiderer's agency and the conspiracy remain vague throughout (−0.4). No causal turn occurs on the page—the chart's completion is narrated as inevitable rather than earned by a decision that alters options. The "coup" arrives as summary in the final third without on-page stakes or cost; the closure unit (chart complete, secrets uncovered) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible consequence. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density increase reweights the dominant stake with cost at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents atmospheric wandering rather than causality: Aria moves through the labyrinth, finds letters, approaches a clearing, raises the shard, speaks to an apparition that dissipates—each beat feels like "and then" rather than "because/therefore." No on-page choice narrows options or imposes cost; the manifestation's arrival and departure are externally triggered, not earned by Aria's agency. The "instant before deciding" is invoked in opening and closing but never dramatized as a stake with a legible before/after. Closure reads as thematic echo, not Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.1)
    The opening anchors who and where adequately; time is signaled ("twilight," "anesthetic starting to take hold"). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: mist deepens, coral is studied, anxieties "surface," peace settles—but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The final paragraphs assert transformation ("heart begin to unknot," "sense of peace") without dramatizing a before/after that forecloses a path or reweights prior material through action or image. Closure remains declarative rather than landed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors Lena in the ruined orchard by the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena rediscovers joy and the orchard is symbolically reborn—but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page: "she had rediscovered the lost joy" is told, and no prior option or path is visibly foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, fragment, film, colors layering toward a thematic payoff), yet the final image—colors seeping into trees—recycles the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure. Under the selected lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the mural's completion feels like fulfillment of setup rather than a turn that narrows or transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words, but the "pause between question and reply" timeframe remains decorative metaphor rather than dramatized constraint. No causal linkage drives the mirror arrangement: Lena simply decides to "bewitch" without prior pressure forcing the choice. The mural's transformation at the end ("the forest was now alive") registers as visual effect rather than a decision or renunciation with visible cost; the closure reads as narrated epiphany ("she had done it") instead of an on-page change that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=2.8)
    No on-page closure unit: the piece summarizes Lyra's ongoing activities across seasons without a decisive change, crystallized stance, or reweighted image at the end. The narrative lacks a single causal turn—events are presented as-and-then sequencing (she obtains seed, plants it, watches it grow, reputation spreads) with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending offers thematic echo ("her work was far from over") instead of felt cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no payoff, triggering the penalty and Q3 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet gazes at the postcard, sings, and settles into peace. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (rare peaceful slumber after centuries of insomnia), but the cost is conceptual and off-page—no live option is foreclosed in the final beat, and the "weight lifting" is told rather than demonstrated through a decisive action or renunciation. The causal chain is present but does not tighten; the postcard and song serve as catalysts without narrowing tactics or raising stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece has no decisive change, no visible cost, and no before-after legible on the page. The caretaker begins her task and continues it; singing awakens light and glow, but this changes nothing—stakes, knowledge, and options remain static. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (no clear temporal or spatial anchor until well into the text) but does stabilize. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the ending is a static restatement rather than a pattern break or cadence shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through transcription work, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara steps toward diverging paths. However, closure cost is asserted ("paths that lay before her diverging") rather than made legible through a concrete on-page forfeit or crystallized trade-off. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The "before paths diverge" warning and final image gesture toward stakes but do not demonstrate what specific option she has foreclosed or what price she has paid beyond completing a transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the piece declares harmony achieved without a decisive change, visible cost, or meaningful reconfiguration. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early), but causality is absent—Kaelin decodes the message off-page, and the restoration project never faces a concrete test. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (atmospheric detail) and Causal (a puzzle to solve), but neither delivers a legible closure unit. The final paragraph asserts peace and purpose without dramatizing the turn or its price.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where adequately, but no meaningful closure effect lands on the page. The ending offers mood ("peace settling over her") and readiness without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing. The story describes a static ritual (dust-mote watching) across an unspecified timeframe without a causal turn or deepening that forecloses a path. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake; instead, the final paragraph paraphrases prior mood ("balance," "peace") without visible cost or altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit: the protagonist simply walks, finds the father waiting, and they leave together without any decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing on the page. The "drifting prism terrace" shifts constantly yet no action by the protagonist alters tactics or options—the setting morphs by fiat. The weather code is examined but never decodes into a choice that narrows paths or imposes cost. Orientation is delayed: who the protagonist is and why they are in this terrace remains vague past the opening third, and the phrase "butterfly effect" is invoked without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors emerge piecemeal across the opening paragraphs without a stable frame by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). No on-page closure unit exists—the protagonist walks in, senses vague vibrations, then claims discovery without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The stated goal ("to captivate the essence") never narrows options or faces a test; the story ends with assertion ("they knew that they had achieved their goal") rather than a visible cost or reweighted image. Drive lens is ambiguous (neither clear causal linkage nor pattern-taught accumulative structure), and no meaningful tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors early (cave, geode, character role). The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled but never meaningfully tightened; the scattered seeds lead her directly to the chamber without friction or reversal. The closure unit is a summary epiphany ("the symbols held the key... flux and transformation") that tells rather than shows a decisive change; no on-page action or image reconfigures options with felt cost. Drive lens reads Causal by intent but collapses into summary at the end, violating the lens requirement for because/therefore linkage at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is functional: who/where/when anchor by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of performances, stars, waves, chess piece reprised). However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; the story ends with Elian rising to perform again, unchanged, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The final paragraph ("testament to...") delivers thematic summary rather than a closure image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a clear spatial frame (twilight garden) and names a goal (cosmic verse), but no causal linkage drives the sequence: Aria stands, touches the moonstone, dances, and finds the verse "etched on her skin" without obstacle, reversal, or cost. The "spontaneously anchored" hand and glowing dust speck are inert descriptions that do not narrow options or alter tactics. The ending declares success and emotional shift ("weight of her elective exile lifting") without on-page evidence of what was risked or foreclosed. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible; the closure reads as wish-fulfillment summary.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    No on-page closure: the protagonist undergoes no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or stance crystallization that reweights prior material. The piece opens with reflection, sustains reflection, and closes with reflection; the fisherman's stone creates ripples but no causal pressure or narrowing of options. The "before everything shifts" timeframe is declared but never tested. Orientation is present early (who, where, when), but the absence of a legible closure unit with felt cost prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, no decisive change occurs on the page: Kael walks, reflects, opens a box, reflects more, and walks on. The piece offers Conceptual Repricing language ("translate pain into a universal language") but the cost remains abstract and the closure image (disappearing into shadows with the box) does not reweight prior material with legible pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, no decisive change occurs on the page; Aria begins in contemplation, has a vision, and returns to the same state with identical decorations and gauge in hand. The "crucial step forward" is asserted rather than dramatized through altered options or cost. Under a blended lens (leans Accumulative/Textural but never commits), the vision sequence should reweight stakes, yet it resolves into generic affirmation without legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the first paragraph. However, no on-page closure unit exists: the cartographer discovers artifacts, reads diaries, and decides to continue work—a summary of intent rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The ending ("departed...left behind a piece of themselves") is abstract declaration without a final image that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as intended Accumulative but never tightens or breaks cadence to land a closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors are delayed and vague: "echoing terrace" appears early but who the painter is, where the mansion sits, and when in her pursuit this moment occurs remain unclear past the first third. The piece drifts through accumulative description without a causal tightening or meaningful reversal; the painter begins at the parapet, paints, hums, and "succeeds" without cost. The closure claims breakthrough ("the mirrors would now show her the possibilities") but offers no on-page proof of change—no image shift, no price paid, no option foreclosed—only assertion. Under any inferred lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the ending lacks visible, felt, or conceptual cost and reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is vague: we never learn which factions are negotiating, what specific conflict divides them, or what concrete terms are at stake. The negotiation itself is summarized in passive constructions ("negotiations progressed," "delegates departed") rather than dramatized through reversals or choices. No on-page decisive change occurs—Elian feels hope and exhaustion, but no before/after is legible in his options or the world. The piece gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but supplies no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The protagonist walks out, raises the egg, and "released the waters" via unexplained means; no prior causality earns this moment, and no felt consequence follows—she simply "vanished into the rain" satisfied. The orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until paragraph 8+), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: is this causal (her plan), accumulative (landscape restoration), or thematic meditation? The ending offers thematic summary ("legacy," "echo of extinct birds") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable window. However, closure fails the cost-proof test: the courtesan "walks away" changed, but no on-page sentence identifies what path was foreclosed or what she renounced. The "untangling threads" sequence summarizes process without showing a single concrete choice that narrows options. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (snow, prism, echoes recur), yet the final image ("disappeared into the snowy landscape") does not reweight the dominant stake with undeniable pressure—it asserts transformation via travel metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but the piece lacks causal linkage—Amaranth enters, sets up, works, and leaves in an and-then sequence without meaningful tightening or a decision that narrows options. The ending offers satisfaction and renewed purpose but no visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply packs up after a productive session. Under a best-case Accumulative lens, the "meteor hush" and creative flow accumulate atmosphere but do not crystallize into a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with felt pressure. The heated argument mentioned in the opening never returns to complicate or charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the story presents a continuous, static mood rather than escalating density. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but no on-page closure with felt cost: Aria's departure is merely described as an intention, not a renunciation or shift that forecloses a path. The ending asserts "presence lingered" and "power of the human spirit" without a decisive image that reweights prior material. Closure form is RR-aspirational but lacks the undeniable pressure or visible cost required.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens infers Accumulative/Textural but delivers static description rather than pressure accumulation. Akira begins with her goal (preserve names) and methodically executes without reversal or meaningful tightening; the rope works on first attempt. Closure—"she had done it"—lacks felt cost: no on-page choice forecloses a path, and satisfaction is asserted rather than earned. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sanctum, Akira, rope), averting penalty, but causality remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost: Hindsight emerges from dreams with "enriched understanding" and walks forward into "possibility," but no option is foreclosed, no path refused, no price paid on the page. The storm functions as atmospheric window-dressing rather than a causal constraint. The "decaying directive" remains abstract setup; it never narrows tactics or choices. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce slowly across the first 15% without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.8)
    No identifiable closure unit. The astronomer performs a ritual ("raised the tile to the fading light") and the universe simply responds in harmony—no reversal, no cost, no reconfiguration of prior material. The piece offers summary narration of a metaphysical union without showing what changes, what is lost, or what options narrow. Orientation is severely delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" never clarifies era, architecture, or physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation test applied: who/where anchored early, but the "when" and causal stakes remain vague throughout. The dominant lens cannot be confidently inferred—moments gesture toward accumulative (recurring music box) but the mass healing and "reality shifts" imply causal magic without cost or constraint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but offers no on-page cost: the sanctuary becomes "a beacon" through summary, and Elara's later fame is told in epilogue rather than dramatized. The broken pin "lay forgotten" without charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: who the mirror maker is, her concrete location within the orchard, and the timeline remain impressionistic past the first third (−0.4). The piece offers outline sequencing ("As she held… As she began… As the mirror neared completion") without causal because/therefore linkage—each step succeeds without resistance or trade-off. The ending presents a Resonant Reconfiguration (she vanishes into her dream-world), but the cost is told rather than shown: "leaving behind only the faintest whisper" is metaphor without dramatized forfeiture. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the fog, sextant, and synchronized breathing serve as atmospheric props rather than pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.2)
    The orientation test passes with basic anchors, but the causal chain is weak: seeds from a forgotten satchel conveniently solve the problem without prior setup or constraint. The breach of contract is exposition that never pressures on-page choices. Aria's return and immediate understanding bypass earned escalation. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "deciduous vows had not withered; they had flourished" is an asserted reversal without visible cost or a legible before/after in Elara's options or stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the closure unit fails the cost test: the curator "felt a sense of purpose" and smiled, but no decisive change, renunciation, or tangible price appears on the page—only mood assertion ("brightened disquiet"). The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (astral orchard imagery recurs), but the final paragraph summarizes theme ("nonlinear inheritance would continue to shape their understanding") rather than landing a resonant image with felt weight. The bathroom revelation is told, not shown through scene pressure, breaking causal linkage at the story's conceptual hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words ("labyrinthine bookstore sprawled across the mountain" offers no concrete anchor). The closure unit is a summary cascade ("the journey had changed her...she had found her true calling") that tells transformation without dramatizing cost. The inferred lens is causal, but key turns (finding the diary, opening the hidden door) occur through convenience rather than earned because/therefore linkage. Applied −0.4 for orientation debt and −0.6 for asserted closure without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.7)
    The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but closure fails the cost-proof test: Lyra "finally found what she was searching for" and feels "peace" without any on-page sacrifice, renunciation, or altered tactic. The Garden materializes as reward rather than reconfiguration. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fog thickening, stories weaving, emerald glow), yet the ending supplies declarative arrival without cadence shift or reweighted image. The middle explores fragmented passenger stories but causality remains and-then sequencing—no tightening choice narrows options before the cove appears.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story teaches a causal lens but delivers no meaningful closure with cost. Emilia descends with a document and "clarity," but no prior option has been foreclosed and no visible price paid. The "moment when the door shouldn't exist" is mentioned but never dramatized or tested. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending summarizes future intentions rather than landing a decisive change or reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as the mapkeeper's study of crack patterns leads to the bloom of hush. However, the closure lacks a decisive change or visible cost: the bloom simply "takes hold" and the mapkeeper smiles, satisfied. The energy beings "sensing the change" adjust without resistance, which undercuts agency and cost. The final image reconfigures the caves' state but does not reweight prior material with felt consequence—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The midpoint shift in crack patterns signals change, but the resolution feels granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural attempting a lyric cadence through the pavilion walk. Orientation anchors appear early (pavilion, custodian, post-collapse), satisfying the test. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the orrery lighting and "thistle-blown hope" blooming, but no visible cost appears—the custodian simply succeeds, the light "fades," and purpose is declared without foreclosing a path or paying a price. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is required; the story offers accumulation of images but no tightening or cost that reweights prior material. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence at closure shows a legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but when remains vague ("after the fog became solid" functions as mood, not clock). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist observes, the storm clears, she descends, memories flood, she conjectures, then departs. No decisive change or tightening narrows options; the ending ("she knew that she would carry the collective memory with her always") summarizes a stance already present at the start, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Closure is asserted, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece offers a mood walk that ends where it began—Lyra seeking inspiration, finding a note, feeling renewed—but no decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The mosaic message ("In the stillness, find the spark") is received as affirmation rather than a constraint that narrows options or imposes a felt price. Orientation is present (fortress gardens at dusk, fire spinners, then night stroll), but causality is loose: the note's discovery feels coincidental and its effect is emotional uplift without tactical or relational consequence. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the dominant stake with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit exists: the chronicler begins in contemplation, remains in contemplation, and rises still contemplating, with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible. The two figures' conversation "resumes" off-page without consequence to the protagonist. Orientation is present (grotto, starlight, seated chronicler) but the piece offers only thematic meditation without causal linkage, escalation, or visible cost. The dominant lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—texture remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: silences accrue flavor by flavor, building density toward the final image of Eli glancing back with "quiet, stretching presence" inside. Orientation anchors (trellis, hour of inversion, Eli with father) arrive within the first 120 words. However, the closure unit—"claustrophobia had not vanished, but it was no longer the dominant force"—is told rather than shown through a decisive action or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence demonstrates what Eli gave up or risked to gain this peace, only assertion that "the gilded hush had worked its subtle magic."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs. The operator begins teaching silence, drifts around monitoring atmosphere, then steps off smiling with "another step" taken—pure continuation without visible cost or foreclosed path. Orientation is present (who/where/when anchor by ~80 words) but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern-break nor situational crystallization emerges. The final paragraph asserts harmony "achieved" and "comfort" delivered, yet no on-page action or image demonstrates the before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when blur until the waterfall), triggering a −0.4 penalty and the Q3=7.0 cap. The piece follows a video-game fetch-quest structure (enter zone → collect item → follow light → reach goal) without causal linkage; the ruby flake simply "guides" without Aria making a choice that narrows options. Closure is a declarative arrival ("sat upon the throne") with no on-page cost, renunciation, or visible before/after shift—she gains power without forfeiting anything. The lens is nominally Causal but collapses into summary convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is weak: "ashen charcoal sanctuary" anchors place vaguely, but who the keeper is and when this occurs remain hazy past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (shadow-tending → reconnection → revival), and a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the keeper steps through the threshold. However, the cost is told ("their journey had changed them") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or image, weakening closure legibility. The "fading threshold" problem and its solution via the flickering flame feel convenient rather than causally seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is beyond a name, where exactly she stands in the farm, and what the quantum promise concretely means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure lacks visible cost; diamonds appear, Lyra laughs, and walks away with no option foreclosed or price paid on the page. Causality is thin: glitchy messages guide her actions, but the link between her touching the bolt, the machines behaving erratically, and the diamond shower is asserted rather than dramatized through motivated steps. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither strict causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—and closure does not land as DC, RR, or CR with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored early enough, so no penalty applies. However, no legible closure effect occurs on the page—the protagonist simply rises with "newfound understanding" and walks out. The final paragraphs summarize future consequences ("In the years to come...") rather than delivering a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost in the present moment. The text relies on assertion ("knew that they would never be the same") instead of dramatized transformation, and the claimed cost (ending a dynasty) remains entirely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (knight), where (greenhouse), and when (endless night) are present early, but the Orientation Test penalty is waived because the setting anchors are functional. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (withdrawn nature replaced by purpose, allegiance to Lysander) but the cost is not legible on the page—no visible trade-off, forfeiture, or constraint is shown. The knight's actions (unsnapping the wooden catch, grasping the shimmering entity) do not narrow options or change knowledge in a way that demonstrates because/therefore linkage or accumulative pressure with price. The ending asserts transformation ("their journey was far from over") without dramatizing what has been lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads accumulative/textural, but no decisive tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost. The piece unfolds as steady observation across weeks with no on-page reversal or narrowing of options. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she had found her true calling") but the final image is assertion, not dramatized cost—nothing forecloses a path or crystallizes pressure on the page. Orientation is clean; the fundamental issue is absence of closure pressure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: Aria's situation at dawn is identical to her situation at the story's opening—she holds the key, believes in resistance, and walks away. The "gathering" beat offers no reversal, tightening, or cost; allies appear, she shares her tale, they disperse. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~15% in) but eventually lands; however, the structural issue is terminal—there is no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The piece reads as atmosphere and exposition rather than a pressured sequence with causally linked turns.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, no meaningful closure unit lands: the saxophonist plays, the prophecy is "laid to rest" by assertion, and she departs satisfied. The piece offers Resonant Reconfiguration in name only—no before/after options are legible, no cost is visible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist, music, prism motifs recur), but the final paragraphs loop rather than deepen, and no cadence shift reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern by the 25% mark; it drifts between vague prophecy-decoding and monument-building without clear escalation. Orientation anchors (who she is beyond "seed sorter," where the arbor exists in relation to anything) remain abstract past 120 words. The ending declares transformation and prophecy unlocked, but no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs with visible cost—the speck glows, she smiles, she walks away. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a choice forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the baseline test. However, causality is thin: Elian finds the compass rose, walks to the greenhouse, improvises a device, and emerges with newfound clarity—each beat linked by "and then" rather than "because." The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("uncertainly certain" as guide), but the cost is purely asserted ("weight of the compass rose still held in his hand") without a visible forfeiture, trade-off, or foreclosed path on the page. The device's function and the nature of Elian's transformation remain abstract, undermining closure legibility under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page decisive change or cost is visible; the story summarizes months of off-stage transformation ("experiments yielded unexpected results") rather than dramatizing a single choice or renunciation that alters options. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words. The piece reads as a retrospective summary of a journey rather than a scene with causality; the "redemption" is told, not shown, and no before/after pivot lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the collector walks, listens, hums counterpoint, and the woman's spirit dissipates—pressure accumulates through sensory layering rather than because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's energy fades, the collector turns to pursue the next soul), but the cost is abstract: no visible forfeiture, no choice that forecloses a path on the page. The ending restates the opening frame ("quiet once more," "until the next collector came") without reweighting prior material or charging the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—"after the anesthesia wore off" and "makeshift clinic" emerge gradually—but the effect doesn't charge closure, triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal-textural: Elara's decision to enter the forest is causal, but the forest sequence shifts to accumulative sensory description without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing ("mathematics of mercy") with stated peace, but the cost is asserted ("ultraviolet penance lifting") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. The rescue mission and interrogation backstory are referenced but not anchored in present causality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous past midpoint; no taught pattern by 25%, and the final paragraphs loop rather than deepen. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by ~120 words, so no Orientation Test penalty. Closure unit is unclear: the ending recycles earlier abstract language ("eternal instant," "anchors of intuition," "hidden histories") without a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The story asserts transformation ("newfound purpose," "boundaries begin to blur") but does not dramatize a before/after with visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure unit is ambiguous: Ezra leaves with the barrel and "feels the weightless burden," but no visible cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—she simply exits into the crowd, content. The dust-to-logbook sequence reads as because/therefore linkage (Causal lens inferred), yet the discovery of the circus's history does not narrow her options or alter her stance on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; she completes her exploration without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is diffuse: who/where/when emerge slowly across the opening third without legible urgency (−0.4). The dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is declared late and remains abstract; no on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge. The "rupture" and "rustling awakenings" unfold as passive atmospheric effects rather than causal beats, and the closure ("the operator knew that they had succeeded") is told rather than shown with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end; the final image is a static tableau without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard discovery seeds a project that deepens through reflection and verse-writing, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist is "reborn as a chronicler." Orientation anchors (baroque asteroid, dim galleries, laboratory) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the revolutionary reimagines herself alongside the civilization), but the cost—solitude, the weight of unrecoverable truth—is more asserted ("burnished sorrow") than dramatized in a single pivotal image or choice that forecloses a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, meeting the test. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: atmosphere and motif density build toward the moment the box plays. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the silent box now sings, balance is restored—but the cost is abstract ("task complete") rather than visible on the page. The covenant of rust and light/darkness motifs recur but never narrow Erebus's options or force a trade-off; the final turn feels declared rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is and why the factory closure matters remain vague through the first third. The piece offers a single continuous move (walk to grotto, decipher symbols, achieve unity) with no reversal, complication, or narrowing of options; pressure is asserted ("shiver," "trepidation") but never dramatized. Closure purports to be a Resonant Reconfiguration, but "becoming one with the lagoon" and finding "the place where explanations fail" are stated outcomes with no visible cost, forfeited path, or before/after legibility. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent, yet density does not increase and no pattern breaks or cadence shifts reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. Aria walks away with "gratitude" and "inspiration," but nothing has altered her options, knowledge, or stance—she remains in the same creative mode she began in. The GPS failure is setup without payoff; the slide's "mystery" is never unlocked or reweighted at closure. Orientation is acceptable (who/where/when by ~100 words), but the lack of an on-page closure unit with cost caps Q2 below 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece is reflection-led accumulative/textural, signaling lens ambiguity past midpoint: no causal linkage tightens options, no situational pressure crystallizes stance. Orientation anchors arrive late (~paragraph 4 for cathedral, ~paragraph 5 for timeline). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "dawning hush" and the final smile, but cost is absent—Luna simply "began to understand" with no forfeiture, renunciation, or poise under pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) applies and triggers the Q3=7.0 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within opening lines (no orientation penalty). However, closure is absent: the final paragraph loops back to continuation ("would return... again and again") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible with cost. The zeppelin "sails on" in open continuation rather than crystallizing stakes or foreclosing a path. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (library atmosphere, debris messages, lagoon motif), but no cadence shift or density break reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is established (who, where) but the temporal anchor "after the last wish is granted" remains cryptic and unused. The piece operates in pure contemplation mode with no causal linkage—the alchemist sits, thinks, rises, and begins work in a linear sequence without reversal or tightening. The ending claims transformation ("the town began to transform") but shows none on the page; closure is asserted rather than demonstrated. No visible cost accompanies the decision to act.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, no legible closure effect materializes: the scribe completes a task, feels trepidation, and disappears; the "accidental prophecy" is declared but never enacted on the page with visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. The story reads as a single descriptive tableau without a meaningful tightening or deepening—beats loop (working, noticing patterns shift, feeling wonder/trepidation) rather than narrow options. Under any inferred lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), the ending offers mood without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who and where anchor by the opening, but "after winter's chill dissipated" and "the egg...had hatched" place time vaguely in backstory; no visible temporal constraint tightens present action (−0.4). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by midpoint (atrium thaw, vortex visions, cycle imagery), but closure drifts into summary exposition ("Years would pass...she would become a legend") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material with cost on the page. The "act of passing it down" realization and entropy claim are told, not dramatized. Cost at closure is conceptual but not made undeniable through image or forfeited action; the piece ends in drift rather than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/role shift) as its closure form. Orientation anchors arrive late—who (Ember), what (storm siren tester), and where (sanctuary above clouds) coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The core turn (switching focus from sirens to bell) lacks a concrete precipitating cause; Ember "hesitates" and "waits for something" without dramatized friction, weakening the causal through-line even under an accumulative lens. Cost is implied (sirens "no longer the focus") but never made visceral or visible on the page at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but no escalation or closure effect occurs. The piece moves through static description without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the janitor begins reflective and ends reflective with no cost paid. The lens is ambiguous—accumulative phrasing ("tracing the path of falling stars") suggests textural mode, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake. The final paragraph repeats the opening thesis ("flourishing stillness") rather than delivering a turn or reweighting prior material with visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece establishes "after ghosts become visible" as timeframe and sets the wasteland oasis clearly. However, no causal escalation or reversal occurs: the recluse approaches the box, opens it, reads letters, closes it—a linear sequence without narrowed options or a decision that forecloses a path. The ending offers mood ("beauty to be found") but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. Under a presumed Accumulative lens, the density does not deepen or break pattern at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test failure: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "borrowed-time timekeeper" is a label without grounding, and the emerald silo's function is never anchored. The piece operates in Accumulative mode but no decisive tightening or deepening occurs—each paragraph restates the same mood without altering options or knowledge. The ending ("ready for whatever came next") is pure deferral with no on-page closure effect, no felt cost, and no reconfiguration of prior material. Waiver tests for Track B (mosaic pattern taught by 25%) are not met; the piece loops rather than transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of dawn imagery, mist, feather). The closure image—poet walking away with feather, world "new"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The kite-string snap arrives as an unmotivated external event with no causal link to prior beats or the poet's choices, failing to tighten stakes. Under the Accumulative lens, the final paragraph reweights nothing; the Cost Proof Test fails—I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words—by line 4 we have "island caretaker," "temple orchard," and "living stone pillars," but no anchored scene, no present tense action, and no legible timeframe until the diagnosis arrives mid-story (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece operates as a life-summary montage rather than a continuous scene or two-shard window, violating the 600–800 word scope defaults without teaching a mosaic pattern or providing legible transitions. No on-page closure unit exists: the caretaker's work "continued" and "would live on," but no decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs in the final image. The ending recounts legacy in abstract terms ("a reminder of the power") rather than landing a concrete, charged moment. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization coheres at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past the first third—who the skeptic is, why they're here, and what "first contact" means remain vague throughout. The story moves via atmospheric description rather than causal linkage; the skeptic walks a path, sees footprints, meets an entity, but no because/therefore chain connects these beats. Closure consists of mutual standing and a claim that understanding has arrived ("deeper understanding of the mysteries"), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with legible cost. The inferred lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the end—only assertion that something has shifted.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: "gloom-hill coachman" opens without grounding who, where, or when until multiple paragraphs in, and even then the reef/jetty/battlefield geography remains vague. The story follows a single enacted task (fertilizing soil) with no reversal, complication, or narrowing of options—no because/therefore linkage. Closure is asserted ("landscape transformed," "promise of a new dawn") but occurs off-page in future tense; no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost appears in the final image. The piece reads as a scenic tableau rather than a story with escalating pressure and on-page resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Krael scrapyard, Lyra + Kael, post-war wasteland) arrive early. The inciting discovery (wax orb) leads to riddle-solving and the journey, forming a causal chain under a hybrid lens (causal setup → accumulative journey). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (finding the spring shifts their sense of purpose and belonging), but cost is asserted ("their journey was far from over") rather than demonstrated—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The ending image (sitting by the spring, orb glowing) reweights hope but the felt price remains rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words). A single tightening occurs when Aria moves from passive observation to sketching, aligning the compass and distant light, but the closure reads as meditative affirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final paragraph's "promise of a new horizon" asserts transformation without demonstrating what path has been foreclosed or what price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as causal-aspirational but delivers summary transit: Moonwhisper moves through the spire, swaps pieces, and the sky corrects—all told in past-progressive gloss without a single reversal or complication. The chess-swap itself is summarized ("carefully selecting those that held the secrets") rather than dramatized with friction or cost. Closure is a Decisive Change (sky restored) but the cost is absent on the page; success arrives unearned, and no prior constraint or price shapes the final image. Orientation anchors are present early, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who the characters are and what they want remains abstract past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 Orientation Test penalty. The dominant stake is never clarified—no live choice forces a trade-off—and the ending ("stood there, poised on the threshold") offers declared poise without visible cost or a decisive change on the page. The interregnum frame and "unbind the past" quest are announced but never narrow options causally; the piece reads as allegorical tableau rather than dramatized pressure, failing closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "mercury-glass seer" but no grounding of who/where/when by ~120 words; the mountain bookstore remains a postcard. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the seer searches, finds the stone immediately, and enacts magic without obstacle. Closure reads as summary assertion ("she had created something new") with no on-page decisive change, visible cost, or earned reconfiguration. The inferred lens is unclear; no causal pressure or accumulative deepening holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear early enough. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (tutor emerges reborn, forgiven) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, renunciation, or visible trade-off occurs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere, symbolic labyrinth, pattern of guilt/redemption) but the final deepening is delivered through summary ("finally found a way to forgive himself") rather than a charged image or cadence shift that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what the tutor sacrifices or loses to achieve peace.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation remains vague throughout: no anchors for who (nameless artist), where (canyon layout unclear), or when (ritual timeframe never specified). The piece drifts through summary narration without a single dramatized scene—no beats, only abstract declarations. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("forged hush," readiness for ritual) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible choice or foreclosed path appears on the page. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—resulting in a −0.4 penalty and cap at 7.2 per the lens-ambiguity rule.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "last wisps of air" initially confuses whether Kaelin is drowning or holding breath for a task. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through breath-holding and pockmark-matching toward a moment of discovery and survival. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Kaelin survives, finds meaning, and accepts the peace—but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page; we see exhaustion but not what path was foreclosed or what she renounced to reach that peace.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but causality breaks when the painter teleports from dock to cave network mid-paragraph ("her reverie was shattered when she took a wrong turn") without setup or transition. The ending offers thematic summary across four paragraphs ("temporary eternity," "intimately aloof," legacy declarations) rather than a decisive image with visible cost. No on-page closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—lands; the painter simply "disappeared into the shadows" after years of unshown work. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; instead the final quarter loops theme statements without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the lighthouse keeper role is named early, but "assistant" appears only in line one with no spatial anchor until "small garden" emerges later; this mild delay does not severely harm closure, so no orientation cap is applied. The piece lacks a legible closure unit: Elian begins fascinated by the vial cork, beckons to the universe mid-story, feels energy wash over him, then climbs stairs "content to vibrate in tune"—no decision, renunciation, or reweighted image with visible cost occurs on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (garden scent, vibrations, repeated "screaming tenderness"), but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end; the final paragraph restates the opening premise without tightening or cost. Causality is intact but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is vague—"starlit signal station," "sprawling landscape," and "great, empty plain" remain placeholders without spatial anchors past the 120-word mark. The piece follows an accumulative lens (journey through loss, cryptic guidance, moon-phase navigation), but the closure—"a sense of peace settle over her, a sense of acceptance"—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or reconfiguration. No on-page cost is legible in the final beat; the "reverse migration" completes off-stage. Causality is loose: cryptic calls guide but their content and mechanics never narrow options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear closure unit: the forager discovers cures, experiments (off-page), then walks away with "resolve" but no visible cost or decisive change in options. The dominant stake—whether to use the cures—is never tested in scene. Orientation is delayed: the empathy virus premise and the forager's affliction are not anchored until deep into the story, and their connection to present action remains abstract. The lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern is taught early or paid off with a cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure unit—Kael retrieving the boutonnière and returning to the lighthouse—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than undeniable on the page. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (mist, lighthouse lore, borrowed memories build density), yet the ending does not decisively reweight prior material; the stranger's departure and Kael's retrieval feel like a graceful fade rather than a crystallized choice or reconfiguration with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "lonely antique map dealer" but no concrete spatial anchor or time-of-day grounding by ~120 words; the shop remains a white room. The drive lens wobbles between situational (ants as guide) and accumulative (symbols, maps, flowers) without teaching a pattern early. Closure relies on finding a note and a hidden chamber—discovery without agency or felt cost—so no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing lands on the page. The "doorway of decisions" is named repeatedly but never crystallizes into a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens with spatial anchors (cobalt grotto, ridge, clouds) but the Orientation Test is borderline: "who" remains vague (disenchanted from what? ruling where?), and "when" after the final warning carries no on-page constraint. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (bleeding starlight, lacy imagery), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the queen simply climbs, gazes, and steps forward without narrowing options or reweighting cost. Closure is withheld: "a truth that would change her forever" is summary-only, providing no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing on the page. The "after the final warning" frame is never dramatized or used to constrain a single choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure effect. The protagonist begins examining a shell and ends having "unlocked its secrets" and "captured the density of presence," but no decisive change, visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—only assertions of success. The piece offers continuous description without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation is delayed: the "who" and operative goal remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece lacks a legible closure with visible cost—the protagonist simply finishes writing and declares satisfaction without forfeiting anything or facing a trade-off. The "chronologically confused" frame is introduced but never constrains a choice or creates friction. No meaningful escalation: the narrator writes, the words flow, and the process concludes without reversal or deepening. The drive lens remains ambiguous between accumulative and causal without teaching a pattern early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but no escalation or decisive change occurs on the page. Elara's arc is entirely reflective: she picks up the screw, thinks about her methods, puts it down, and leaves with the same stance she entered. The "trembling calm" and fog recur as atmospheric motifs but impose no cost or choice reversal. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights a stake; under Causal, a because/therefore link narrowing options—neither materializes. No closure unit (DC, RR, or CR) with legible cost is present.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: the stillness deepens through recurring images (platform drifting, whispers, quill, sandalwood) until the sunset appears as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost remains implied rather than visible—Kaito feels satisfaction, but what he forfeited or endured is not legible on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The held-breath moment offers a micro turn, but the closure image (platform drifting into darkness, whispers fading) reconfigures tone more than stakes, leaving conceptual cost oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): by 120 words we know only "dimly lit sheet music archive" and "Lyra sat," with no grounding of time, spatial layout, or why she is there now. The dominant stake—reconnecting with Astra—is declared but never tested on the page; the "induced currents" method appears as metaphor without causal mechanism, and the closure is pure summary ("her message had been sent"). No visible cost or reversal occurs; the hum and glow are atmospheric props, not beats that narrow options. The orchard's destruction is seeded early but never paid off in the ending, leaving a promised tension unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; "the heart of the ancient temple library lost in time" provides no spatial or temporal anchor, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in ambition but lacks a legible closure unit with cost: Aria closes the dictionary and re-enters, but no before/after change in options or meaning is dramatized. "Cosmic illusions unraveled" and "universe restored" are asserted without on-page proof. The structure loops through paraphrase ("the witness had done her work," "the true treasure lay in the understanding") rather than tightening toward a decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening third without clear spatial grounding (−0.4). No causal escalation or decision point narrows options; the shepherd observes clocks, turns a key, counts backwards, and feels satisfaction in a flat sequence without because/therefore linkage. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; it simply reasserts the shepherd's vigilance. Closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who and where early, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she starts with a plan, rides trains gathering insights, and ends with the same plan reinforced. The closure unit is a stated resolve to create a therapy program, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes under pressure. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is missing; under Accumulative, no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and what early enough, satisfying orientation. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with legible cost. The operator begins answering calls in a loop and ends waiting for the next call in the same loop—no before/after is traceable, no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes with felt price. The narrative is purely accumulative description without a closure unit, violating the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit lands on the page. The piece cycles through documentation → photo contemplation → walking away without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with felt cost. The final third shifts to summary narration ("Years later...") that tells outcomes rather than delivering an on-page ending. Orientation is delayed: "walnut-ink archivist" and "regenerated covenant" appear without spatial or causal grounding in the opening ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, causality remains vague: the moon rock "catalyzes" change through unspecified whispers, the crowd's transformation happens off-stage ("began to shift," "slowly giving way"), and Raven's agency is passive observation rather than decision that narrows options. The closure—Raven slipping away feeling peace—offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the "cure" is declared complete without on-page evidence of what was sacrificed or endured. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design but never teaches a pattern or delivers a decisive reweighting at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story presents a single continuous journey toward a stillpoint without meaningful reversal or tightening; the mapmaker walks, pauses, continues, and arrives with no narrowing of options or visible cost. The closure unit—"understood the hidden harmonies"—is pure assertion lacking any on-page change in knowledge, relationship, or capability that forecloses a path. Drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative texture is attempted through repeated imagery, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), preventing deeper penalty, but escalation and cost legibility are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive but the gravitational anomaly remains decorative postcard—no concrete spatial constraints affect Aria's access or tactics. The drive lens is ambiguous: causal links are weak (pen restoration triggers cosmic whispers without clear mechanism), accumulative pattern is not taught, situational pressure absent. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but cost is asserted ("mending the fabric of her own reality") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or changed option is legible in the final act of writing. The weeds-to-pen sequence lacks because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "whispering advisor" and "luminous harbor" but no concrete anchor for who this person is, why they're here, or what immediate problem they face until well past the opening third. The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is asserted but never tested by a causal turn; the "symphony" simply unfolds without obstacle or cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the camera and the vanished advisor, but no on-page choice or forfeiture makes a before/after legible; the advisor arrives, performs, and leaves with no dramatized price. The orientation delay triggers −0.4 in Q2 and caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers summary of Elian's artistic process across "days" without dramatizing a single causal beat where a choice narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening, avoiding that penalty, but the narrative operates in pure synopsis mode: "set out to create," "began to leave their mark," "the trail grew." No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the vandalized portrait mystery is declared solved in exposition ("the truth behind the vandalized self-portrait, a tale of love, loss") without any scene showing discovery or cost. Closure form is absent—no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the drumming intensifies the lagoon's glow, then a vision crystallizes and fades, leaving Aria with resolve to continue. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the moment of connection seeds future action—but the cost remains conceptual and felt rather than concretely forfeited on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (sound wave garden, Aria, guinea pig, treatment context). However, the tightening lacks a meaningful narrowing of options; Aria's stance at the end ("she would return… continue nurturing") mirrors her opening intent without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (worker, containers, storm), so no penalty applies. The piece signals an Accumulative lens (collecting objects, building whisper-proof claim) but never dramatizes the whisper-versus-shout test on the page; the stranger's single whispered line is asserted to prove the point without showing how distance or acoustics were tested. Closure is a stated satisfaction ("proven her point") with no visible cost—she leaves with the same objects and a vague promise to return. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; beats are additive without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no meaningful escalation or decisive change occurs on the page—pressure remains static from first beat to last. The "stillwater tension" dissipates without cost, and the guardian's stance at closure is identical to the opening; no option is foreclosed, no knowledge altered. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake. The piece ends where it began, with the guardian gazing at water and the figure vanished, offering Charged Poise without undeniable pressure or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is heavily delayed: who Elian is and what he wants remain vague past the opening third; "hush where past meets prophecy" is atmospheric but unclear until much later. The closure—Elian returns with renewed purpose, town transformed by window displays—lacks visible cost or a decisive on-page change; the displays happen off-page between paragraphs, and the final image is a static tableau with no forfeited path. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (mist, grotto imagery) and Causal (rebellion plan) without teaching a coherent pattern or landing a legible closure effect with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "sublittoral fringe" remains somewhat atmospheric rather than spatially concrete. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the whale's call, the scrimshaw's glow, and the luminescent haze build toward a final image of peace and readiness. However, the closure unit—Kael returning to the dock "her heart unlocked and her spirit at peace"—asserts transformation without demonstrating a visible before/after cost on the page; the "weight of her past" detaches off-stage during the swim. The final paragraph's "combative tenderness" and "sea's secrets whispered" feel thematic rather than a legible reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established (farmhouse, post-Mandate era, Echo alone), but the piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The ending offers descriptive summation ("remade hush," "possibility for...new kind of beauty") and emotional labels rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material with felt consequence. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (repetition, density), yet no pattern break or cadence shift at closure demonstrates visible cost or forecloses a live option. The final paragraphs summarize Echo's ongoing state rather than dramatizing a before/after alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.8)
    No identifiable closure unit—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. Lyra enters, observes, creates poetry, and departs; nothing narrows options or reweights meaning. The "boundaries dissolve" moment is claimed in narration but not dramatized through causal linkage or visible consequence. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout (accumulative texture without escalation or causal through-line), and the ending merely restates the opening premise without alteration or cost. Orientation is present early, preventing further penalty, but the absence of closure caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly and remain stable. However, no causal escalation occurs—the painter arranges plants, the glassblower watches and is "inspired," then the courtyard becomes a hub in summary. The closure is pure tell: "The concept of bartered awakenings had taken root" without an on-page decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration. Accumulative lens might excuse thin causality, but the ending offers no charged image or felt price—only thematic assertion and decorative repetition of the concertina and plants.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The piece begins with exploration and ends with exploration; the "artificial pilgrimage" and "hidden truth" remain abstract claims rather than dramatized stakes with visible cost. The final smile surrounded by golden shadows offers no before/after shift in options or knowledge. Orientation anchors who and where adequately, but the narrative drive remains purely accumulative without a tightening or deepening that reweights prior material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural design through the curtains motif, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the jewelry maker performs tasks (origami, crafting, glancing) without a reversal that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending offers emotional summary ("heart...felt a sense of hope") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page. Escalation is asserted ("observatory grew brighter," "stars shone with increased intensity") but stakes never narrow or deepen causally.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when are anchored by the opening, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs. The piece follows an Accumulative lens but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at closure—the cartomancer simply finishes her night's work and leaves, satisfied. The cryptocurrency-crash framing and "multiplying paths" method are mentioned but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a visible or felt price at the ending beat. Cap Q2 per closure failure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors appear by paragraph two (archive, historian). However, the closure is a summative reflection ("her journey had been worth the anguish and the joy") that merely asserts transformation without an on-page decisive change, reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing. The "atoms of nostalgia" vision and the resulting text are told in summary across multiple paragraphs, and no causal linkage connects her gazing into the pagoda to a narrowed choice or forfeited path. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who (dusk noticer), where (library above clouds), and when (after dreams shareable) arrive by the opening paragraph, so no penalty. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and thematic claims but offers no on-page decisive change or visible cost at closure. The protagonist's journey from study to "newfound determination" to walking through shelves represents intent, not transformation; she exits with the same stone and no foreclosed path. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending restates theme ("metamorphose her understanding into deeper insight") without reweighting prior material through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "after the con was revealed" drops the reader into an undefined event with no spatial or temporal anchor until midway through. The dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice that narrows options or changes knowledge. No causal because/therefore linkage; the piece drifts through reflection and metaphor without a turn that alters Lena's situation. The ending offers mood ("shimmering stillness") but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delayed and scattered across the opening third without clear spatial grounding. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative atmosphere competes with a vague causal quest, but no meaningful tightening occurs; Elian digs, reaches a chamber, and declares closure without visible cost or a before/after change in options. The ending offers assertion ("felt a sense of closure") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. No persistent constraint shapes tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural (immersive meditation sequence building to thematic resonance). Orientation anchors arrive within bounds (projection booth, crystal gazer, film strip by ~80 words). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the reweighted film strip and "secrets now a part of their own story," but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, altered tactic, or foreclosed option. The psychometry vision unfolds as uninterrupted description; no reversal or tightening tests the protagonist's commitment. Because/therefore linkage is absent; events succeed one another without causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern or creates a meaningful cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague; the archway setting and timeframe ("across an unwritten calendar") lack concrete grounding past ~120 words without serving closure. The ending asserts liberation and renewed purpose but offers no on-page decisive change, visible cost, or resonant reconfiguration—only a summarized claim that barriers "dissolved like mist." No before/after state is legible through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (who Asa is and what the archive does remain vague past the opening third), triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no clear escalation or deepening occurs; Asa's "merging" is described rather than dramatized through constrained choices. The ending offers a return to solidity but no legible cost or reconfigured stance—she simply "brushes sand" and walks away. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt price, or conceptual repricing is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece aims to build resonance through recurring images (gear, hum, wind through trees). However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the philosopher wanders, translocates, "begins to unravel," then returns "changed" without dramatized cost or a legible before/after state. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; it simply asserts transformation and fades into ambient description. Orientation is present early (who, where), so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but closure remains absent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "ferry guide" and "ridgeway" early but never anchor a concrete physical shore or named locale, leaving spatial logic vague throughout. The piece follows an Accumulative lens—mist, twilight, symbols accrue—but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page; the travelers simply arrive at a glimmering shore and walk onto sand, a spatial relocation rather than a closure with felt cost. The vigil and star-stamp beats are atmospheric set-ups that do not narrow options or crystallize a stance. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or pattern break is required; here the mood remains uniform and the final "mist began to clear" is a meteorological shift, not a reconfiguration of stakes or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are present by the opening paragraph (waive penalty). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (stillness, silence, recurring "frostbitten hope"), but the piece never tightens or reweights the dominant stake through a pattern break or cadence shift with legible cost. The ending asserts "a sense of peace" and "the right decision" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing visible on the page—no before/after is dramatized, only declared. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the closure unit makes cost legible; the bellhop's "strength" is told, not shown through forfeiture or crystallized poise.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as loosely Accumulative (titan weaves messages over time), but the closure—Kael speaks, pretender crumbles, titan vanishes—occurs entirely in summary without on-page cost or a legible before/after. The Orientation Test is violated: who Kael is, what "diminutive titan" means in this world, and what the pretender seeks remain vague past 120 words and never anchor. No meaningful tightening appears; the "final confrontation" is narrated as outcome, not dramatized choice. Causality is skeletal: "cryptic messages" → "pretender revealed" with no mechanics shown.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (Maya, station, post-ban ocean) adequately. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Maya observes, assembles a drum, taps, examines an atlas, makes a map, then taps again in a loop without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The closure image (drumsticks, rhythm fading, ocean whispering) offers no legible cost or reconfiguration; it restates the opening stasis. The "delayed revelation" never materializes on the page, leaving the premise unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as loosely Accumulative (journey to circle, hum intensifies, return with renewed purpose), but the closure lacks legible cost: the stargazer simply "found what she sought" and walks forward with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The legend functions as a convenient solve introduced early but never tested by failure or complication. Orientation is adequate (spaceport, margin of daylight, mountains), waiving the penalty, yet the ending reconfiguration remains asserted rather than dramatized with felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks orientation anchors: who Akira is insurgent against, what reconstruction efforts mean, and why this artifact matters remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—retrieving and unsealing the embryo—occurs without causal linkage to prior choices; the kite decoding and retrieval feel like sequential steps rather than because/therefore escalation. No visible cost accompanies the unsealing; the ending grants warmth, peace, and approval without sacrifice or forfeiture. The inferred lens (causal) is contradicted by the accumulative/descriptive drift in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early and maintains single POV throughout. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Amira finds peace and resolves to return, but the cost is abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift demonstrates what she relinquishes to gain stillness. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and sensory detail building toward a final cadence shift), yet the ending softens pressure rather than charging it. The photograph's smoothing and her "lighter heart" are told outcomes, not dramatized consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit lands on the page. The piece describes a process ("threads untangled," "weight...begin to lift") but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or crystallized stance occurs in a final beat. The orientation test fails: who she is (name, age, history), where precisely (room layout, lighthouse function), and when (season, time of day, duration) remain vague past 120 words. Causal lens is attempted but causality between untangling and transformation is asserted rather than dramatized with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via shared understanding of time's slowing, but the cost is entirely abstract—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed. Orientation is delayed: "wind-carved encampment" and "after the eclipse ends" provide minimal anchor, and we never learn where this is or why these two people matter until the final third. The causal chain is thin: Kael follows ink patterns, crests a ridge, touches a shoulder, and suddenly achieves metaphysical insight without any tightening or reversal. The "moment" when "time seemed to slow" at contact is asserted, not demonstrated through changed options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece opens with spatial anchors (library, snow, shelves) but lacks temporal grounding and remains vague about Aria's present situation until midpoint. The closure—Aria watching screens as "the world was changing"—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted ("turmoil and transformation") rather than shown; no specific choice, renunciation, or image makes the before/after legible on the page. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the transmission itself happens off-page ("Within the blink that follows surprise, the message would spread") and the aftermath is summarized in sweeping claims without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the piece is a static tour of Aria's sanctuary without a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration. The opening presents the farm as already thriving; the ending reaffirms the same state with no visible cost or alteration. Orientation anchors who and where early, but the tower's fall and airship crash are backstory without present pressure. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture is attempted but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end, and no causal turn narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear closure unit emerges: the fisher hears the echo, basks, and leaves with no visible cost, foreclosed path, or before/after distinction in her options or knowledge. The narrative follows an and-then sequence (wanders → stops → voices silence → hears echo → leaves) without because/therefore linkage or accumulative pressure that narrows stakes. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~180 words of abstract description. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative pattern but does not pay it off with a reweighted final image or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but causality remains outline-sequential: Adelaide receives a call, ponders using proof by contradiction, then descends with renewed determination—no because/therefore linkage tightens options. The "proof by contradiction" method is declared but never applied on the page; no assumption is tested, no contradiction surfaces to alter her stance. Closure is a Charged Poise attempt (she smiles, knowing truth is within grasp), but no visible or felt cost is legible in the final image; the descent into mist is atmospheric rather than a reconfiguration of prior stakes. The piece reads as setup without a turn that narrows options or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality is weak: "haunted firmware" whispers recede when she wraps cord around her wrist with no mechanism or cost shown. The letters appear suddenly in paragraph eight without prior signal and connect to her guilt only by assertion. Time "folds in on itself" is announced but never dramatizes a before/after change in options or knowledge. The ending offers atmospheric closure ("meteor hush," "vanished into the dawn") without a legible decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing tied to prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation arrives slowly: who (chalk artist), where (grotto), and what she's doing (mandala) are clear early, but the present dramatic question remains vague throughout. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or pattern break reweights the stake with cost; the artist simply works until she feels resolution. The tile flake message "listen deeply" arrives but doesn't alter her tactics or narrow options. Closure reads as a mood shift ("sense of peace") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure unit—Aria renaming the plaza—occurs on the page but carries no legible cost: no option is foreclosed, no tactical shift follows, and the "promise of a new beginning" is asserted rather than demonstrated through changed stakes or knowledge. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift to reweight the dominant stake; instead, the final third loops the same abstract claims ("aberrant mercy," "warm coldness," "resilience and hope") without tightening pressure or adding specificity. The retrocognitive vision and the act of renaming are causally inert—neither narrows options nor generates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies: who Echo is, why she is here, and what "fractured timeline" means remains vague past the 120-word mark and is never dramatized as a concrete before/after. The story asserts a closure ("timeline began to repair itself," "sense of peace") but no decisive change or cost is visible on the page—Echo simply "vanishes" after generic "echoes grew fainter." The lens is ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative density lands cleanly), and no felt price anchors the ending. Under any lens, closure is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens—Luna exploring creative states through interaction with the geode—but no meaningful tightening or cost appears until the final paragraphs, and even there the "newfound clarity" and "sense of accomplishment" feel awarded rather than earned through prior causality. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but the closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration without visible cost: Luna simply arrives at satisfaction and harmony with no path foreclosed or price paid on the page. The static shock is mentioned as a recalibration moment, but what Luna loses, risks, or gives up to achieve this state remains absent, reducing the closure to an emotional summary rather than a felt change.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the story unfolds as a guided tour through tunnels without a meaningful tightening or reversal—Aria walks, senses, continues walking, and arrives at beauty with no narrowing of options. The closure presents tranquility and companionship ("she was at peace," "not alone") without demonstrable cost or a before/after that forecloses a live path. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a cadence shift or reweighting with cost; instead, the final third plateaus into summary contentment. No on-page consequence alters her stance or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are present by the opening lines; no penalty applied. However, no meaningful closure unit exists—the turner "continues to work" in an open loop with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses a path or reweights stakes with felt cost. The ending recycles the opening's static tableau without alteration of options or knowledge. Drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative texture is attempted but never tightens or deepens); applying −0.4 for lens drift and capping at 7.2, but the absence of legible closure drops the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "burned spy" and "Zephyr Bluff" anchor who and where, but no concrete stake or immediate situation emerges until the clearing encounter, which itself lacks causal grounding—nothing on the page explains why the figure appears or how finding it resolves the search. The "codes in accumulated snow" are mentioned as a method but never shown or used; the spy "began to search" but immediately the mist clears and a path appears, bypassing any actual problem-solving. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (meeting the other self), but the cost is asserted ("weight of her past lifting") rather than demonstrated through a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (mist imagery, spring motif, repeated "sense of"), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply declares resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, no causal linkage drives the sequence: the coachman waits, threads a needle meditatively, the woman appears from the fog, they cross together—each beat exists in isolation without because/therefore pressure. The closure image ("world that was full of possibility") asserts transformation without visible cost or a legible before/after in options, knowledge, or stance. Under a charitable Accumulative lens, the fog-clearing and needle-threading might signal a tightening, but the final paragraph's abstract claims ("distilled complexity into simplicity," "spindrift serenity suspended in time") replace scene pressure with thematic echo, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: "abandoned beekeeping oasis" and Akira's name arrive early, but her goal ("understanding why some places resist change") and the fractured-timelines conceit remain abstract until midpoint, creating conceptual fog. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—gathering images and meditative beats—but no decisive tightening occurs; the revelation about kindness is asserted in summary ("she glimpsed the answer") rather than earned through on-page discovery or choice. The closure unit (taking the glass and leaving) lacks visible cost: Akira departs with understanding but nothing is foreclosed, no path closed with felt price. Applying Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cost-proof penalty −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure with cost. The gardener begins tending flowers and ends having tended flowers; no decision alters options, no stance crystallizes with visible price. The piece claims transformation ("instilled a new sense of life") without dramatizing what changed or what was risked. Orientation is provided early (harbor, fire escape, night), so no penalty there, but the accumulative lens never tightens into a closure beat—merely dissolves into summary assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors appear late: Lyra's role and the floating library location emerge gradually without immediate spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of preservation + brittle awakenings motif), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The ending's "smile" and "weight lifting" are told summary, not a final image that reweights prior material. Closure form fails the required definition.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens with clear spatial anchors (lotus temple, lily pond) but the causal linkage is thin: Lena sits, notices a nest, watches artists, contributes the twig, and experiences a realization without meaningful resistance or tightening. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she discovers connection through collaboration), but the cost is abstract and not legible on the page—no option is foreclosed, no tangible price paid. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the epiphany is asserted rather than charged by events.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within range, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Lyra sends a counter-signal and the problem simply dwindles with no on-page cost or trade-off. The "crisis averted" is told in summary: "reports of strange occurrences dwindling" lacks a concrete before/after image or felt price. The piece attempts a Decisive Change but closure is asserted rather than dramatized, and the inferred lens (causal) collapses into convenience plotting where the protagonist's single action solves everything off-page. No visible or felt cost at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece anchors who and where by the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure relies on a passive discovery sequence: Lyra follows music, picks a lock, touches a crystal, and receives a cosmic vision without agency-driven escalation. The "spatial mutiny" and crystal awakening occur *to* her rather than through choices that narrow options or incur cost. Under a Causal lens, the ending lacks a Decisive Change tied to protagonist decisions; under Accumulative, the final image ("wistful rebellion," "new cycle") restates the premise without reweighting prior material with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mist, ribbon, and portrait accumulate toward a thematic reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the artist "felt a sense of clarity" and knows "she had helped to thaw a part of the detective's heart"—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation anchors (quarry, mist, artist-at-easel, detective) arrive early. The accumulative pattern is legible, but the ending remains declarative rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure or price.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no on-page closure: Emilia's "journey" is declared "far from over," explicitly withholding any Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is delayed (dome, workstation, journals appear piecemeal without clear spatial or temporal anchor by ~120 words). Causality is skeletal—she reads journals, feels dread, presses on—with no meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options. The ending is pure setup, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, when anchored by end of first paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (music as transformative act, pattern of fog→clarity→legacy), but no meaningful tightening occurs—the fiddler stands, plays, leaves, with no causal pressure narrowing options. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the music's echo, but cost is entirely asserted ("transform," "redeem") rather than felt on the page. The pixelated amnesty and hitchhiker vanishing are set-ups never paid off in scene action. Lacks a before/after legible through dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (abandoned circus train, Kael, dusky sky), but the dominant stake remains diffuse: is he processing his startup failure, seeking lesson-sharing closure, or exploring territorial impulse? The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—collecting observations and reflections—but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost. The ending ("carrying with him the dusky harmony") offers lyric echo without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible. Cost is asserted in summary ("disillusionment," "determination") but never lands as a felt or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    No on-page closure with legible cost. Lyra decodes inscriptions and feels renewed, but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs; the "weight lifting" and "midnight solace" are asserted emotional states, not dramatized changes that foreclose options. The piece is a single continuous scene of reflection without a causal turn or reversal—she sits, thinks, works, and feels better. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers summary of emotional resolution rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. Under any inferred lens (most likely Accumulative/Textural given the lyric cadence), the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is unclear through the first 150+ words—who, where, and when remain vague abstractions ("guarded druid," "swirling orchard vortex," "after the magic trick failed") without concrete anchoring. The closure—touching ice, cracks spreading, realizing mirrors show souls—lands as a thematic assertion rather than a decisive change with visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The lens drifts between lyric-accumulative patterning and a causal quest structure without committing to either by midpoint. The ice-breaking moment is the only candidate turn, but it resolves via convenience (touch → instant revelation) rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is unclear by ~120 words—who Aria is, where the glade sits in space/time, and what inciting event triggers this moment remain vague. The piece follows an accumulative/textural design, but no meaningful tightening occurs; Aria enters the maze, walks, touches the tree, receives visions, and leaves without a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The "eclipsed covenant" and "intersection of dreams" remain abstract declarations; no on-page decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with felt cost is legible. The ending asserts future possibility rather than reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality remains decorative rather than motivated. The protagonist wanders, spots a card, weaves a spell, and leaves—each beat operates in loose sequence without because/therefore linkage. The closure asserts transformation ("forever changed," "more whole") but no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs with legible cost; the final image is a mood statement, not a reweighting of prior material. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift charges the ending—density remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Jack is and where he sits emerges slowly across the opening, but the quarry/trailer relationship remains spatial vague throughout. The piece announces a causal design (phone call as catalyst, memories as pressure) but delivers pure summary: the amplifier conversation happens entirely off-page, the "public failure" is referenced but never dramatized or specified, and the ending cascade ("began to make notes," "walked out of the trailer") consists of declarations without a single concrete choice or visible cost. No decisive change occurs on the page; the closure is a list of emotional claims. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applied; also cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is serviceable: who (Elara), where (Magnetic arbor), when (after spirit leaves) anchor by the opening. However, no decisive change occurs on the page—Elara begins pondering and ends pondering, with "reestablishing connection" summarized rather than dramatized. The ending declares success ("secrets revealed," "balance...lost") without showing a before/after shift in options or knowledge. No visible cost forecloses a path; the mist clearing is purely atmospheric, not a closure unit with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    No causal linkage or meaningful escalation. The text drifts through declarations ("the librarian found a strange sort of peace") without on-page pressure or a decisive change. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but what the librarian does remains vague throughout. The ending offers summary philosophy rather than a closure unit with felt cost. Lens is ambiguous—neither causal progression nor accumulative density increases; no stakes tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn Aria is a bunker inspector only in the first sentence, but her goal and the stakes remain vague throughout. The piece strings together atmospheric moments without causal linkage—spotting the pearl, touching it, listening to the shell—but no because/therefore chain tightens options. The ending asserts transformation ("the pearl's latent radiance shining brightly within her") without demonstrating what choice was made or what path was foreclosed. No legible closure unit with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where precisely she sits, and when this occurs remain hazy through the opening third; "truth-seeking river chronicler" functions as a label without grounding work. The piece reads accumulative/textural in intent but lacks a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the forgiveness stake with visible cost. The ending offers mood ("raw solace") but no legible before/after in options, knowledge, or felt price—she simply walks on. Closure form is absent; the final image does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (veiled dreamer, glowing library, mist-shrouded city) arrive early. The piece gestures toward accumulative design—dreamer seeks library, finds book/watch, documents patterns, steps through doorway—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; each beat is additive rather than transformative. The closure ("library of unspoken words was not a destination, but a state of being") asserts a Conceptual Repricing without legible cost: the dreamer smiles, carries secrets, and continues the cycle with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Under an accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material; here it merely restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early, but no causal escalation or decisive change occurs on the page. The piece is a single reflective passage describing Elian's task and internal state without a beat that narrows options or alters knowledge. The "closure" consists of stepping into the unknown with determination—a gesture without visible cost or before/after legibility. Drive lens remains unclear; the piece reads as extended setup without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who: Aria, beautician mortician; where: skyborne grotto; when: unstated but single continuous session) appear early enough. The dominant stake—infusing the emerald chip before crossing into stillness—is signaled, but the closure effect is ambiguous: Aria completes the task, feels peace, the threshold recedes, then her "spirit took flight... infused with the radiance of the divine." Whether this is death (Decisive Change), refusal (Earned Stasis), or metaphorical transcendence (Conceptual Repricing) remains unclear on the page, and no visible cost forecloses a live option. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (aurora energy, gemstone work, repeated stillness motif), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; instead it offers soft, declarative uplift. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a price paid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit: the story summarizes Aria's discovery of contentment and connection to the cycle of rebirth without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing on the page. The narrative offers exposition about her journey ("she realized," "she felt") rather than dramatizing a moment where options narrow or meaning reweights with visible cost. The hairpin's significance is told in hindsight summary ("began to reveal itself") instead of shown through action. Orientation is delayed—grotto location and Aria's role emerge slowly without early spatial anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: who this conscience is, what "unhooking" entails physically, and how wind chimes function as method remain abstract past the midpoint. The closure—"their work was done"—is declared rather than shown through a decisive change or visible cost; the client never appears, so no before/after is legible. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in intent but lacks a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the premise with cost. The "cloak of doubt" is unhooked off-page, severing causality from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit: the student "understands" in an abstract declaration without visible cost, altered options, or a before/after that can be traced on the page. The piece reads as a single extended exposition of a teaching method rather than a scene with escalation. Orientation is present (who/where/when anchored early), but the drive lens remains unclear—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern nor situational crystallization coheres at the ending. The final paragraph asserts success and possibility without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words with vague anchors (what is a "harmonic stone skimmer"? sentient object? metaphor?), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. No legible closure unit exists: the piece drifts through centuries of passive observation without a decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing that lands on the page. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("In the stillness, the skimmer had found a new kind of movement") rather than an image with felt consequence. Drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern break is evident at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. However, no causal turn narrows Eira's options: she wanders, finds the garden, touches the keystone, feels energized, and walks away with renewed purpose—a sequence of "and then" beats without a meaningful tightening or cost. The closure unit (her renewed sense of direction) lacks visible or felt cost on the page; nothing is forfeited, no path foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lingering luminance, garden imagery), but no density shift or cadence break reweights the stake at the end. Under the Cost proof test, I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat, triggering a deduction in the −0.6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The story follows a single continuous descent with coherent spatial progression. However, closure reads as summary declaration ("he had finally found what he was searching for") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page. The ending asserts transformation without demonstrating what Kael sacrificed, chose against, or how his options narrowed—no visible before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early enough. However, no causal escalation occurs—the decision maker pours liquid, it distills, they drink it, done. The "backwards prophecy" is declared fulfilled without on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending offers peaceful alignment rather than a decisive change with felt cost; "wavelength align with purpose" is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Closure form (RR/DC/CR) is absent; the piece summarizes fulfillment rather than enacting pressure and reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The reaper performs a ritual (crystallizing echoes), then lowers their hands and vanishes; no options are foreclosed, no felt cost is legible, and the ending simply restates the opening mood. The piece reads as a single static tableau under an Accumulative lens that never completes a meaningful tightening or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is established (sapphire viaduct, dawn, mage alone with bell). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ritual steps accumulate toward restoration—but no meaningful tightening or cost emerges. The bell's repair unfolds without complication; each drip succeeds as intended, the cracks seal, the toll sounds. Closure lacks felt cost: the mage walks away satisfied, the "cosmic imbalance" corrected off-page without on-page sacrifice, trade-off, or foreclosed path. The ending delivers Conceptual Repricing in name only; "plausible impossibility" is asserted rather than demonstrated through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who: warden; where: reservoir town; when: twilight after water lowered) arrive within the first 120 words, satisfying the test. However, no on-page closure effect materializes: the warden begins walking to document/heal, walks through the town taking photographs, and ends still walking with the same intention. The trail of photographs is mentioned as leading to "a forgotten memory" but that memory never surfaces, no decision alters tactics, and no cost is paid. The piece reads as a single extended beat of observation without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately but lacks a legible closure unit with cost. The crystal activation and starling pattern observation are presented as successful discoveries without foreclosing options or demanding sacrifice. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sensory layering, mystical atmosphere), but the ending offers only thematic echo ("touch of wonder") rather than a decisive change, earned stasis with cost, or conceptual repricing. The final paragraphs loop back to the beginning state (Elara returns to work) without visible transformation or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through its layered repetition and dense atmospheric work, but no meaningful escalation or deepening occurs—Lyra works, revises, and completes her task in a smooth arc without cost, reversal, or genuine friction. The ending offers a completion moment (device finished, dawn arrives) but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; she simply turns to leave, ready for the next task, which reads as narrative drift rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but the piece offers no legible closure unit—no decisive change, no renunciation with visible cost, no final image that reweights prior material. Kaito meditates, feels peace, and walks out; the "journey" is recounted in summary without causal pressure or a before/after that foreclosed a path. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because no density increase or cadence shift lands at the end. History "rewriting itself" is mentioned but never constrains a choice or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is vague past 120 words: "household" and "echo chamber tunnel" remain abstract placeholders with no spatial anchors or causal link. The inferred lens is Accumulative, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the leaf blower performance succeeds without resistance or reversal. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (laughter restored), yet the cost is invisible: no sacrifice, foreclosed option, or felt price appears on the page. The hourglass timeframe is mentioned once and never constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The guardian begins waiting and ends waiting; her stated peace is asserted rather than earned through causal linkage or a renunciation that forecloses a path. The mist "reveals secrets" and she "grasps the true nature of boundaries" entirely off-stage, leaving closure to summary claims ("she realized," "she knew") without dramatized pressure or felt consequence. Under any lens—causal, accumulative, or situational—the ending recounts a transformation rather than landing it with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough (−0.0). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—the alchemist gathers fragments, weaves energy, and succeeds without reversal or cost. The closure claims transformation ("the world was forever changed," "new path had been forged") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; the ending summarizes outcome rather than dramatizing pressure or foreclosed options. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what was lost or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation arrives adequately (moon, tower, gorge, Aria's role by paragraph two), but no causal escalation occurs—Aria moves from tower summit to chamber to summit again without narrowing options or paying visible cost. The "shard of hush" remains metaphorical window-dressing; no on-page action demonstrates what tuning into it requires or what price she pays to access the hidden chamber. The ending offers summary assertion ("truth that would change her life forever") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern breaks or cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake—only thematic declarations accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (ferry, deckhand, grotto), but no meaningful causal tightening occurs. The vanishing ferry premise seeds expectation but never constrains Elara's choices on the page; discovering the markings does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The ending offers poise without cost: Elara "steps into the unknown" with excitement, but no prior path is foreclosed and no price is paid or felt in the final image, leaving closure incomplete under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillates between accumulative/textural (pattern weaving, sensory eruptions) and causal (thread "guiding," "unlocking") without teaching a coherent method by midpoint. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words, waiving that penalty. Closure lacks on-page cost: the architect returns to the entrance with the thread and "memories begin to alter," but no decision, renunciation, or visible price lands; the cycle simply resets. The ending asserts transformation ("unlocked a secret") without dramatizing what changed or what was lost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit is present. The story begins with Lyra as instructor and ends with her as instructor; no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The lesson proceeds smoothly without reversal or tightening that forecloses options. Orientation is delayed—who Lyra is beyond title and what immediate stake drives this lesson remain unclear past the 120-word mark—triggering the Orientation Test penalty and associated caps. The structure reads as sequential exposition rather than causal or accumulative pressure toward a legible ending shift.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a continuous scene in the atrium with clear spatial anchors (no orientation penalty). However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the hearing aid pulses suggest causal method, the mist-clearing implies accumulative atmosphere, yet neither proves dominant by closure. The ending offers comfort but no legible cost—Aria departs unchanged, the woman vanishes with closure already granted, and no option is foreclosed on the page. Without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt price, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material, closure does not meet the required standard.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately within the opening third. The codex retrieval creates a linear goal structure, but escalation is thin: Lyra encounters no meaningful opposition or complication until the tide change, which functions as a timer rather than a pressure that alters tactics. The closure—emerging on the surface with the codex—is a Decisive Change in location but cost remains abstract ("changed," "connection...stronger") rather than legible in action or forfeiture. Phase-transition travel is introduced only at the ending without prior setup, weakening causal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Akira, opal observatory) but the temporal frame ("after the radio static clears") arrives mid-story without prior setup, violating the early-signal principle. The dominant stake—understanding the digital ghost—accumulates through ink-pattern study and reflection but lacks a decisive on-page change: the ghost "coalesces" and Akira feels peace, yet no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (letting the shard fall), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) wavers with late Causal gestures (ink study, defragmentation) that do not link through because/therefore. The piece teaches a reflective, lyric mode but does not pay it off with a charged final image that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed: "copper-veined storyteller" and "canyon of endless echoes" anchor setting, but the who/what/when remain abstract through the opening third. The piece accumulates texture (birds, shadows, whispers, diamond) without causal linkage—no because/therefore chain connects watching birds to "harnessing their power" to creating "a new language." The ending asserts transformation ("new lexicon," "new world of sound") but offers no on-page cost, decision, or before/after contrast; the storyteller sits at the start and sits at the end, with the canyon's state unchanged except by declaration. Under an Accumulative lens, the density never breaks or shifts cadence to reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but "the missing return changed" remains opaque past midpoint, never clarified or paid off at closure—orientation debt applies (−0.4). The ending offers no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; Lena walks away with "frostbitten hope" and a flint arrowhead, but no path is foreclosed and no live option narrows on the page. The piece gestures toward accumulative texture but never teaches a coherent pattern or delivers a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no causal linkage drives the transformation: Luna plays, statues crack and awaken, orchard blooms—each beat unfolds as inevitable result of her presence rather than because/therefore pressure. The closure offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the statues are freed, Luna departs to repeat the formula elsewhere, and the mechanical world's "grip" is merely "loosened" without on-page consequence. Under a causal lens, the story reads as a declarative sequence; under accumulative, no pattern break or cadence shift reconfigures the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The lens reads as attempted Causal but linkage is weak; the mailman's "linking absences" method is mentioned but never shown constraining a choice or altering tactics. The ending delivers the package without on-page cost or a decision that forecloses a path—he simply hands it over and feels "satisfaction," a summary emotion rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and image (misting hush, wind bells, halo fragment) toward a final statement of creative renewal. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the carpenter's work is "infused with a newfound sense of purpose," and the train becomes "a cradle of creativity." Cost is conceptual—the misting hush "a blend of sorrow and hope"—but remains abstract rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. One tightening (discovery of the oasis) deepens mood but does not narrow options with visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page. The librarian begins seeking stories, ends having "found" them, but the transition is recounted in summary: "Through her work, she began to sense...," "It was a moment of profound beauty." Orientation is delayed: the "scientific poetry library" anchor arrives quickly, but the librarian's goal and method remain abstract until midpoint. The piece reads accumulative but lacks a pattern taught early enough to land as coherent design. Under any lens, cost is asserted ("done," "peace," "success") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The story cycles through identical dawn captures without escalation, tightening, or cost; the final paragraph ("the journey...remained a mystery") explicitly refuses closure. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal links nor accumulative density nor situational crystallization emerges. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (dawn setting established but "odd-hour librarian" and the whispering archipelago's geography remain vague), triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "labyrinthine paths" anchor neither specific geography nor stakes until the tree appears mid-story (−0.4). The piece gestures toward Accumulative/Textural mode via recurring star/lock imagery, but the closure—locksmith frees the idea, watches light seep out, then leaves—lacks visible cost or a reweighting that changes prior material. The "enveloped secrets…given freedom" is asserted, not dramatized with consequence. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the lock simply yields.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where adequately, but the closure unit is absent: Emilia ends exactly where she began—curious, determined, ready—with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing on the page. The "decades later" frame promises retrospective weight but delivers only a summary claim; the mushroom's discovery generates no cost or narrowed option. The piece reads as a setup without a final image that reweights prior material. Drive lens remains ambiguous (Causal aspirations without because/therefore links; Accumulative without cadence shift at closure).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who (archivist), where (library), and when (afternoon) are anchored by ~80 words, passing the test. However, no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The archivist "unlocks secrets" and takes "the first step towards reversing the exile," but this remains summary-only assertion; the shadow's state does not change, no option is foreclosed, and the final image (empty cup, lingering gaze) carries no legible price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (annotations deepen via tea-leaf patterns), but closure does not land because no before/after reweighting or cadence shift occurs that makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece offers summary rather than scene: Aria plants a seed, "weaves a spell," and the world transforms without causal steps or visible resistance. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—she succeeds easily from beginning to end. The closure lacks decisive change; the final image is pure affirmation without cost, consequence, or foreclosed path. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early, but the narrative unfolds as a series of outcomes without because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The piece establishes an accumulative lens through repeated "interlaced hush" and the gradual unwinding of knots, but the closure lacks visible cost: the spirits dissipate, the restorer walks away feeling purpose, and returns to work unchanged. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable pressure or cost at the final image, and here the ending simply reasserts the opening state without tightening or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; orientation anchors appear by ~120 words. The closure unit—Elara's discovery of the henge's "secrets" and feeling of wholeness—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), but the cost is abstract ("fragile" truth, "sense of peace") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The video-comparison method is introduced early but its mechanics and specific findings remain vague ("subtle patterns, almost imperceptible changes"), obscuring what knowledge actually changed. No meaningful tightening occurs; the "findings began to take shape" is summary without on-page revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word mark (sunken ship library, but depth, entry method, and timeline anchor arrive late). The closure unit—"embracing the fluidity of existence"—reads as thematic summary rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The lens wavers between accumulative (lecture fragments, net untangling) and causal without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off with a felt price at the ending image. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence demonstrates what Eli forfeits or gains in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain hazy past 120 words, requiring the reader to infer a mystical realm from atmospheric description rather than clean anchors (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test). No meaningful escalation occurs; the balladeer sits, ponders, creates art, and leaves without a decision that narrows options or changes knowledge. The "ghost in code" remains an abstract presence that never constrains choice or produces a legible cost. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—she gathers her things and slips away, leaving the courtyard "forever changed" by assertion rather than dramatized evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story offers orientation (elevator, spire, servant role) but no meaningful escalation or closure unit. Elara reads a page, walks a corridor, finds a shrine, and leaves—pressure never tightens, no option is foreclosed, and no cost appears on the page. The final paragraph's "newfound appreciation" is told rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. Lens ambiguity (neither causal linkage nor accumulative deepening) persists through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who (Lyra), where (sky gondola), and when (evening after a storm) arrive piecemeal across the opening paragraphs without a clear anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric layering, introspection, final mood shift), but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs—Lyra ends in "peace" without forfeiting an option or facing a dilemma. The closure unit is absent; the story circles its concepts without a legible before/after with felt cost. Backstory (mentor, telescope inheritance, "spooled wholeness" philosophy) occupies ~30% of the text but remains abstract and does not tilt a present choice or charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Escalation operates through density layering—artist at work, book safe discovery, coin interpretation, pre-demolition awareness—culminating in the artist departing with the secret and a charged final image. However, the closure unit (artist departing, carrying essence and secrets) offers only mild Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost is conceptual ("what had been lost, and what had been gained") but not legible in a specific on-page forfeiture or altered tactic. The because/therefore linkage is present but gentle; the demolition clock ticks but doesn't force a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader learns "antique airship" and Eli's role within the first paragraph, but spatial anchors (cabin layout, table position) remain vague. The luminance discovery triggers curiosity but no narrowing of options; Eli simply charts it. The ending gesture ("ready to set course") projects future action rather than landing an on-page change with cost. Under a loose Accumulative lens, the piece offers recurrence (starlings, luminance glow) but no decisive tightening or felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a coherent closure unit with felt cost. Kael enters seeking knowledge, finds the hall of mirrors, and achieves understanding in a final paragraph that tells us "the secrets of the universe were now within their grasp" without demonstrating what was risked, altered, or lost. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake—only summary assertion replaces scene pressure. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when by the opening), but the ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (symbols, energy signatures, collective ritual), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the nebula plan is proposed and executed without reversal, resistance, or cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the transformed landscape, yet no before/after choice or stance crystallization is legible—the settlers celebrate an achieved state without visible price paid on the page. The "brambled hope" and butterfly garden return as ornamental callbacks rather than reweighted constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (hush, flaw, lullaby) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors late—"doomsday clock adjuster" and "hidden lighthouse" arrive quickly, but "what task" and "what stakes" remain vague past the first third. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the lullaby spreading across time, but cost is asserted ("their work would endure") rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or altered option lands on the page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies for delayed concrete stakes; closure lacks on-page cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens appears Causal but key links are missing: how does finding the blueprint enable reactivation, and why does marking stones cause the mechanism to work? The closure offers a Decisive Change (labyrinth reactivated) but the cost is invisible—no trade-off, sacrifice, or foreclosed path appears on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The because/therefore chain from nut → blueprint → assembly → reactivation lacks concrete steps; "assemble the necessary components" and "leaving impressions without touching" are told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: insight builds through reflection and observation toward a reweighted understanding of grief and connection. However, the closure unit—Maria's emotional lightening and renewed purpose—lacks visible cost; grief simply "lifts" without foreclosing a tangible option or paying a felt price. The transformation is asserted through summary ("her heart felt lighter") rather than dramatized through a decisive image or action that makes before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchoring (library, shelves, bottle). However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Ember picks up the bottle, considers breaking it, decides not to, then experiences a series of pleasant realizations without narrowing options or paying a price. The "glimmering parole" concept and her quest to "find where stories begin" remain abstract throughout, never forcing a concrete choice. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing potential ("stories...woven into the very fabric") but the cost is nowhere legible on the page; she simply smiles and feels at home. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what she has given up, risked, or transformed through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (fortress, kitchens, chef). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (fortress, dunes, tidal pool, pavilion) and ends with Elara standing at the fortress heart after subsuming remorse—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she has faced stored remorse and emerged). However, the cost is asserted ("weight of the pavilion's presence," "peace settle over her") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The closure image ("Elara…stood at its heart, a symbol of resilience") summarizes rather than charges prior material with visible price, weakening the RR's felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (tower, Emilia, night). Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (silos now bridging gaps, Emilia's hope), but cost is never made legible on the page—no sentence shows what she gave up, what path closed, or what friction she endured to achieve this transformation. The grain elevator "talks" and undergoes change entirely off-stage; the conversation's content and its causal effect on the town remain abstract. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density of poetic description), but the final image ("vigorous tender hope") reweights nothing with undeniable pressure; it summarizes an outcome without showing the tightening that earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear early enough. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the mirror simply reveals memories once restored, and Elara's subsequent visits summarize discovery without on-page cost. The ending offers summary transformation ("changed her," "newfound sense of purpose") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible price. The piece reads as outline-like accumulation—moon rises, mirror is fixed, memories accessed—without causal linkage or a legible closure unit that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established early (archivist, manuscript, grotto quest). The structure follows a linear accumulative pattern: study → recognize phenomenon → enter grotto → find tomes → leave with knowledge. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the archivist encounters no obstacle, makes no choice that forecloses an option, and pays no visible price. The "closure" is a return to work with declarative satisfaction, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens (accumulative/textural) requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the ending simply restates the premise ("her journey was far from over").

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (sculptor), where (siskin alder grove), and what (creating music in silence) within the opening lines. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs: the sculptor reweaves sound into a silent world, and the final image shows the grove "forever changed" with the insulator as testament. However, the cost is told rather than shown—"the silence was still there, but it was no longer oppressive"—and the causal chain is loose; discovering the insulator and integrating it into the sculpture does not narrow options or create a reversal, it simply extends the existing project. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of music-making, final cadence shift), but the deepening lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit—the piece ends with the tutor walking into darkness and a promise of future discovery, not an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but the "eclipsed covenant" and "magnetic nexus" remain unexplained abstractions that never constrain a choice. The narrative is a single reflective stroll without reversal, tightening, or causal linkage; beats loop ("he sat," "he rose," "he walked") without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The inferred lens is unclear—neither causal progression nor accumulative pattern coheres to a closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful closure occurs: Elara opens the diary, reads it, closes her eyes, and feels purposeful—a declared epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece treats "understanding" as arrived-at rather than a decision that alters options. Under a hybrid lens (accumulative texture collapsing to a causal expectation at the end), the final image does not reweight prior material or impose conceptual price. Orientation is delayed until ~90 words (workshop, stars, lanterns) but remains tolerable; no penalty applied there, yet the lack of on-page closure prevents any score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory detail and recurrent phrases toward a resonant final image. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (treetop village, herbalist role, and timeline remain vague until the seed purchase), applying a −0.4 penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration via summary ("years later" jump to apothecary renown), but the cost is asserted rather than shown on the page—no visible foreclosure or felt price anchors the before/after. The "turning of the tide's thought" remains an abstract timing device without causal linkage to Lyra's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes a causal frame (countdown → flight → discovery) but the central revelation arrives without obstacles or reversals that narrow options. Lyra simply flies to the pool and realizes the answer; no prior choice or constraint makes this discovery costly or transforms her situation. The closure offers a Decisive Change (mystery solved, new mission planned) but the cost is conceptual only—"never see the universe the same way"—without visible forfeiture or tactical price paid on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough to waive the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the investigator gathers sensory and spatial data, building toward a closing realization. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "The investigator felt a sense of clarity wash over her, a sense that she was one step closer to understanding the truth"—but the cost remains abstract ("hazy precision," "silence of the port city") rather than a forfeited option or a concrete sacrifice visible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs (recognizing the wind's adaptation and the patch's symbolic weight), satisfying the length's escalation requirement, but the ending reconfigures understanding without demonstrable on-page cost that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.8)
    No legible closure unit occurs: the "sculpted hush" is "unfettered" off-page via convenience (the chisel strike), and Elian's smile afterward asserts success without on-page cost, choice, or stance crystallization. The orientation window (~120 words) fails to anchor who Elian is in concrete terms, where precisely she stands in the cavern, or what immediate problem drives her; the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4). Causality is abstract: singing causes shimmer, chisel strike causes "burst," but no because/therefore linkage alters options or knowledge. The piece reads as a single descriptive tableau rather than a sequence with motivated linkage or accumulative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive reweighting at closure. The flute-playing sequence describes mystical effects ("boundaries began to blur," "navigating the unseen paths") in abstract terms without a concrete before/after that shows visible cost—she simply re-cases the flute and walks away unchanged in circumstance or knowledge. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, and the narrative progresses through a ritual beat, but the ending offers only declarative summary ("forever changed") instead of an image or action that reconfigures prior material. No on-page cost is legible; the claim of transformation remains asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery around stars, press, fragment), but no meaningful tightening or cost appears at closure. The final paragraph asserts "crucial step" and "lucidity of vision" without demonstrating what options narrowed or what price was paid. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the closure image ("walked into the night") does not reconfigure prior stakes or charge the Halo fragment with new weight—it simply stops.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. Eira walks, encounters a woman, they lock eyes, then part—no options are foreclosed, no visible cost is paid, and the encounter leaves her exactly as she began ("sense of peace"). The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending offers only recycled summary and abstract thematic echo. Orientation is present early (aurora-lit ridgeway, relic courier), so no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "quartz arbor," "mystic," and "mist" early, but the car window—the pivotal object—appears abruptly in paragraph three without spatial grounding (−0.3 for orientation debt). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens (mist clears, patterns reveal, hush dissipates), yet no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the mystic simply moves from seeking truth to "knowing" she has uncovered it, with no visible or felt cost. The ending dissolves into abstract affirmation ("truth that was both simple and profound") rather than a concrete image or action that reweights prior material. No closure unit lands.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the loom spinner is, where exactly she sits, and what immediate situation she faces remain vague past the opening third. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (building through imagery and repetition) but never teaches a coherent pattern or delivers a legible closure unit with visible cost. The ending describes her "vanishing into the shadows" and leaving "a trail of subtle changes," yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—only asserted transformation. The puzzle assembly and weaving are narrated as occurring but do not narrow options or reweight stakes through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (blacksmith, forge, orchard planet) and maintains spatial coherence. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the opening suggests causal crafting (silk imbues strength), but the middle drifts into accumulative description (mine exploration, floating arches) without pressure linkage, and the ending offers a stance crystallization (accepting the apprentice) that was never contested. The closure unit—passing on knowledge—arrives without on-page cost; the blacksmith's solitude is "broken" but no path is foreclosed, no tactical trade-off visible. The sword's completion mid-story diffuses rather than tightens pressure, and the apprentice's arrival functions as convenient narrative wrap rather than a turn earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story provides exposition about a phenomenon and a quest but no on-page closure with visible cost. The protagonist moves through "a succession of worlds" in summary, then emerges claiming she "finally uncovered the secret"—but the reader never sees the discovery, the choice it forces, or the price paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by the first paragraph), but causality is summary-only: each transition is narrated as completed rather than dramatized with because/therefore linkage. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (skipper's identity and role remain vague until "supply skipper" tag; spatial layout of lantern room unclear). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with the cairn-building as a meditative deepening, but no on-page decisive change occurs—the skipper's "resolve" is declared, not earned through a choice that forecloses an option. The Cost Proof Test fails: the final image (sea glass glowing, lighthouse watching) offers atmospheric resonance but no legible price paid or path closed on the page. Orientation Test penalty −0.4; Lens holds but closure lacks cost, preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is, where precisely she stands, and what concrete problem the ritual solves remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece offers no causal linkage or motivated pressure—she ascends, adjusts the lantern, and the dawn arrives as declared, with coincidence (stars twinkling "in rhythm") replacing agency. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs; the final paragraph loops back to "the cycle would continue" without reweighting prior material. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative decoration vs. situational ritual), and closure does not land with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece orients adequately by ~120 words (Kaito, tea house, blue morpho wing) and adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure remains ambiguous: the final paragraph asserts understanding and wonder without a decisive on-page shift in options or knowledge. The wing's colors "danced" and Kaito "realized" connections, yet no specific cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—the tea house "drifted on" unchanged. The narrative loops back to valley-mist wonder and iridescent caution without a visible before/after alteration or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive promptly. However, no causal linkage drives the repair: the worker holds the sextant, closes their eyes, "weaves" dream-threads, and the object is instantly whole. The closure offers no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; the worker descends feeling wonder, their journey "just beginning," which defers rather than delivers closure. Under any inferred lens (most plausibly Accumulative given the lyric diction), the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who she is emerges around word 60, the greenhouse's function remains vague throughout, and "mirror world" operates as a label without taught rules. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the mica window vision and the closing assertion of healing, but no decisive cost or foreclosed option appears on the page—she continues her work unchanged, the realm "begins to heal" off-stage, and the final gesture (vanishing into darkness) reprises the opening posture without reweighting stakes. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds loosely, but closure lacks the cadence shift or visible price required for RR.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening, satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal linkage drives the sequence: Elys searches, finds a book, reads a message, feels peace—a series of and-then beats without because/therefore pressure. The "closure" is a mood shift (enlarged tranquility) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence break or density surge charges the final image; the ending summarizes emotional state rather than delivering an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (repeated visits, seasonal framing, tonal layering), but no meaningful deepening or cadence shift occurs—each visit mirrors the last without narrowing options or reweighting stakes. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (courtyard, tea house, noticer's routine). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final-visit frame and smile, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the noticer "would return again," undercutting finality. The bread's mystery (vanished bakery) seeds a question but is never paid off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs on the page. Elara begins cataloging and ends having cataloged; "carrying a piece of that beauty" is summary assertion without visible cost or altered options. The orientation is vague—anchor details arrive late and remain abstract (frozen library "above the clouds"). Drive lens is unclear: the "sampling frequencies" and "hidden harmony" suggest accumulative texture, but no pattern tightens or breaks to reweight the stake with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal design: Lena seeks the fob, acquires it, then confronts The Shadow. However, the closure unit is weak—the standoff "dissipates" into "fragile understanding" without a decisive change or visible cost on the page; the final paragraph summarizes her feelings rather than landing an image that reweights prior material. The "truce of hush" and "sound of trust breaking" remain abstract, never dramatized as concrete stakes that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Aria walks, the compass guides her, she touches a stranger, and "understanding" arrives as a told sensation without altering options or foreclosing a path. No before/after is visible: she remains a seeker at the end as she was at the start, with no visible price paid or renunciation dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous (neither clear causal linkage nor accumulative pattern taught early), and the "forests hold elections" world-rule appears only as atmospheric decoration without affecting tactics or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes WHO (Elara), WHERE (cave), and WHEN (after laughter fades) adequately by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—portrait completion leading to lock transformation and peace—lacks causal linkage; the lock's "rectification" reads as convenient symbolism rather than earned change. The drive lens wavers between situational (creative block under cave pressure) and accumulative (layered emotion guiding art), never fully committing, and the ending delivers a mood shift without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly, but the story unfolds as synopsis: worker finds cache → Aria reconstructs map → follows it → discovers repository → returns changed. No on-page reversal narrows options; the map leads exactly where promised without friction. The closure claims transformation ("new level of depth and nuance") but offers no decisive image or visible cost—only an assertion that her art improved. Under a causal lens, because/therefore links are missing; under accumulative, no pattern crystallizes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible plot causality: Aria decides to incorporate the iceberg fragment, works on it, and the world transforms—but no because/therefore chain drives these moves, no opposition narrows options, no reversal tests commitment. The "era of words ending" arrives as ambient declaration rather than dramatized event. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until multiple paragraphs in) but the piece eventually anchors. Closure is asserted thematically ("her work was done") without an on-page decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material; the ending restates the opening premise in identical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The controlled burn functions as backdrop rather than a causal agent—Aria's containment work does not narrow options or generate reversals. The ending offers thematic declaration ("finally beginning to find her own peace") without an on-page decisive change or felt cost; the box is lighter by assertion, not dramatized loss. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with undeniable pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (curator Emilia, courtyard thrift store, dawn) arrive early. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the piece oscillates between causal investigation (mailbox mystery), accumulative texture (courtyard storytelling hub), and thematic repricing (listening heals) without committing to one dominant mode by midpoint or at closure. The closure unit—Emilia's satisfied smile and thrift-store curation—lacks visible cost or a decisive change in options; she ends exactly where she began (curiosity rewarded, community role cemented) with no path foreclosed. The writer's revelation is summarized off-page rather than dramatized, undercutting causal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a coherent on-page closure effect with legible cost. Aria "feels liberation" and steps into light, but no prior option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid; the ending declares transformation without dramatizing the decisive change. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without productive disorientation—triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative patterning is attempted (dice, spider, journal) but no causal tightening or decisive reweighting occurs at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when anchor past ~120 words with lantern-lighting opening that does not establish the inciting event. The whale beaches, coffee grounds point to tunnels, the lighter walks, touches crystal, memories flood back—but no meaningful narrowing of options occurs; the protagonist walks toward a solution that arrives on contact. The closure unit (touching the crystal and recovering memories) lacks visible cost; "sense of wonder" and returning to work do not constitute a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence. Drive lens is unclear—causal linkage is weak, accumulative/textural patterning is not taught early, and situational pressure does not crystallize a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past the opening: "nocturnal haven" anchors atmosphere but not spatial or temporal specifics (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece moves from meditation to wing release without a single reversal, tightening, or on-page cost that narrows options. The prophecy's "hushing" is asserted complete in summary rather than dramatized, offering no before/after legible to the reader. No meaningful closure unit (DC/RR/CR with visible cost) lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when adequately. However, no meaningful closure occurs: the student receives a seal and leaves with changed perspective, but no on-page cost is dramatized—no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The "breakthrough" is asserted rather than shown through altered options or tactics. The accumulative design fails to land a Resonant Reconfiguration because the final moment carries no undeniable pressure or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but the closure unit lacks on-page cost. Lyra walks out "changed" and "stronger" in the final third, yet no specific forfeiture, trade-off, or visible price appears in the ending image—only assertion ("her sense of independence forged"). The retrospective summary ("In the days that followed") displaces the decisive moment off-page. Because/therefore linkage is present (seashell whispers → memory recovery → decision to leave), but the final beat offers declaration rather than a felt reconfiguration, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no on-page closure with felt cost materializes. The forger works, finishes, smiles, and leaves—her "calibrated treason" and new narrative are asserted complete but never tested or paid for on the page. The piece reads as a single continuous scene under an attempted Causal lens, yet no because/therefore linkage tightens options or changes knowledge; the task simply ends when declared done. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence or image at the ending beat makes cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.8)
    No legible closure unit. Aria ends where she began—still seeking, still singing—without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures stakes or knowledge with visible cost. The "step closer to understanding" is asserted, not demonstrated; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with vague "serpentine nexus under starlight" and "canyon echo singer" labels that remain undefined. The ending simply restates the opening premise in lyric dress, offering no before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—we lack clear anchors for who Aria is beyond labels, where precisely she sits, or what immediate problem drives the scene. The piece reads as a single extended vision without causal linkage: each revelation ("she saw," "the vision shifted") is told rather than motivated by prior choice. No on-page closure effect lands; Aria's exit with the globe is asserted purpose, not a decisive change with visible cost. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, never settling.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    No meaningful plot escalation or causal linkage exists; the protagonist walks, sits, contemplates, and walks back in a static loop. The "closure" claims she has "grasped the truth she had been seeking," but this realization is asserted rather than earned through on-page action or cost—no decision alters her state, no path is foreclosed. Orientation is present, but the piece operates as a meditative stroll without stakes, reversal, or consequence. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or density shift reweights the material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece teaches a causal lens but linkage is weak: Aria follows paper → reassembles letters → arrives at location with minimal friction or tactical adjustment. The stillpoint's "pulsating glow" at the end signals a Charged Poise moment, but no visible cost or foreclosed option appears on the page—she simply "stood there, poised on the threshold." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early, but the "liquidation" remains abstract and never shapes tactics. The closure image does not reweight prior material with legible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.8)
    No on-page closure effect: the ending recounts years of success in summary without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing moment. The "variant allegiance" shift is told across decades, never dramatized in a single beat with felt cost. Orientation is vague past 120 words (who is the visionary? what is her actual situation?). The drive lens appears causal but no because/therefore linkage tightens options; the piece reads as accumulative but offers no cadence shift or pattern break at closure—leaving it ambiguous and unearnred.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the poet moves through his loft,触s objects, recalls memories, and writes. Orientation is clean (loft, dawn, alone). The closure unit—writing flowing "like a river" and a subsequent smile—asserts rather than dramatizes a shift; no visible cost or foreclosed option anchors the before/after. The "no longer alone" claim contradicts his unchanged solitary condition. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image should reweight the dominant stake with pressure; here it dissolves tension into summary comfort without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when promptly and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory density toward a quiet RR (Earned Stasis: watchful protection as stance crystallization). However, no on-page event narrows options or forces a trade-off; Azure simply completes an unopposed technical procedure and departs satisfied. The dominant stake—artifact safety—is declared but never tested by a complication, reversal, or cost. The ending reconfigures nothing; it restates the opening premise ("artifact is safe… continue to watch") without felt consequence or conceptual repricing, rendering closure ceremonial rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (moon tracking, viaduct energy, waiting posture) but no decisive density shift or cadence break reweights the stake at closure. The "raising hands" moment and viaduct surge are declarative rather than causal; the "revolution had begun" is asserted without on-page consequence or visible cost. Orientation anchors (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, mapper) arrive early, waiving that penalty. However, the piece loops its setup—walking, observing, feeling determination—without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or changes knowledge, leaving closure as conceptual assertion rather than felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is established early (investigator, tunnel, case), but the causal chain is weak: Maya walks, feels emotions, and emerges transformed without a single decision or discovery that changes her options. The "entangled memories" untangle through ambient exposure to the tunnel rather than through empirical observation or a specific trigger. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she exits at peace), but no visible cost anchors it—she sacrifices nothing, confronts no choice, and the case itself dissolves into backdrop. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent, yet the final image merely asserts peace without reweighting prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the chaplain's goal and the nature of his visit remain vague until well past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The ending asserts transformation ("determined to help those in his care") but no on-page decisive change or renunciation with felt cost occurs in the shop scene—he simply receives a gift and leaves with declared resolve. The drive lens is ambiguous (drifts between causal and accumulative without a taught pattern), and the closure unit is summary rather than a crystallized image with pressure. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, satisfying the test. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Zephyr "grasps" the algorithm and rings the bell, but no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no felt price paid. The piece summarizes an odyssey ("Throughout the evolution") rather than dramatizing escalation through because/therefore linkage. The ending asserts harmony and belonging without a visible or conceptual reweighting that makes a before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece orients who (Lena) and where (archive) early, satisfying the Orientation Test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—recurring numbers, cryptic messages, layered metadata—building toward a final reweighting. However, the closure moment ("the files were not deleted, they were simply archived") offers a conceptual answer without visible or felt cost on the page; the discovery is exhilarating and terrifying in summary but does not visibly foreclose an option or reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure. The lens holds but the closure unit lacks the Cost Proof Test requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the peacekeeper gathers mirror-glimpses to reconstitute the crystal, culminating in a soft blue glow and renewed resolve. Orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes, peacekeeper) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the crystal whole, balance reaffirmed, landscape sighing—but the cost is asserted ("burden of her role") rather than dramatized in a trade-off or forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs (crystal fragment → whole), yet the final image reconfigures more through declaration than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but closure arrives as a stated mood ("I was at peace") rather than a decisive image or cadence shift that reweights prior material with cost. The Orientation Test is borderline: who/where anchor by ~120 words, but "woke up changed" remains abstract past midpoint. No meaningful tightening occurs—volunteering appears but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The final paragraph loops "windborne solace" and "approaching endings" without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who, where, and when are vague past 120 words—"lone vineyard sentinel" is a role without identity, "amber pavilion" lacks spatial anchors, and "after the final bus" signals only atmospheric dusk. No causal escalation or reversal occurs; the sentinel walks, observes vines, sits, realizes theme, and remains seated without any narrowing of options or forfeiture. The ending restates the opening mood without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. Under any inferred lens, closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the penalty and Q3 cap. The story presents a single continuous event (prophet arrives, line walker creates clearing, prophet speaks, line walker reflects) without meaningful escalation, reversal, or tightening—pressure remains static. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the ending restates the opening stance without visible cost or option foreclosure. Drive lens is ambiguous (blurred between Accumulative and Situational without teaching a pattern or landing a clear closure effect).

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but stakes remain abstract: "collective healing endeavor" is declared, not dramatized in a concrete choice with cost. The narrative follows an and-then walk-shoot-leave sequence without causal linkage or escalation; no reversal or tightening narrows Luna's options. The ending loops back to tranquility and her gratitude, offering no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing—closure is absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors are present early (library, dawn, scholar). The piece defaults to causal mode but the scholar's agency is passive: summoned to testify, led away. The walk into the city constitutes a spatial transition, but no on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge through protagonist choice. The ending offers a vague promise ("pattern of growth was beginning to reveal itself") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes the price of testimony concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The story follows an Accumulative lens (arranging driftwood, fog imagery, recurring "sound of growing older"), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the prophet simply completes her task and walks away. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final peace/smile, but no visible or felt cost is legible on the page—what did she forfeit, endure, or lose to "locate" this intangible sound? The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a price is paid or an option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the stopped clock hand reflecting "changelessness," but the conceptual repricing arrives through summary philosophy rather than dramatized pressure. Who/where/when anchors emerge reasonably early, but causality remains weak: earth tremors appear without warning, Eli's repairs somehow succeed off-page, and the clock hand stops for no dramatized reason. The lens wobbles between attempted Causal (the repair challenge) and Accumulative/Textural (philosophical meditation), never stabilizing. The cost of Eli's transformation is told ("transformed," "newfound appreciation") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece orients who/where/when adequately (hospice haven, after blood work, Lena tending Emma). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the "scent of hope" motif recurs, cadence slows toward Emma's death. However, closure lacks on-page cost—Emma's passing is described as peaceful resolution ("soft smile," "flawless goodbye") without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. The final paragraphs loop thematic claims ("spirit remained," "scent of hope continued") rather than landing a decisive image that reweights prior material. No meaningful tightening or trade-off crystallizes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a coherent closure unit with visible cost. Lyra moves from confusion to understanding entirely off-page ("Lyra finally understood"), then the story continues for many paragraphs of static summary without a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration that alters options. The dominant lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density produces a legible before/after. Orientation is delayed until paragraph 4 with anchors scattered across early exposition. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents a reflective walk with no on-page decisive change, renunciation, or cost. Emilia arrives uncertain, picks up a tooth, reflects on past events (the substitute body), and leaves with newfound purpose—but this shift happens via interior summary rather than through scene pressure that narrows options. The "cleft in certainty" is mentioned but never dramatizes a choice between competing paths. No visible price is paid; the garden simply catalyzes an off-page emotional reset. The ending gestures toward future action ("ready to embark") but closure requires an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost, which is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The story opens with the star watcher already in a state of stillness and ends in the same state, with no visible cost or alteration of options. The polishing progresses without reversal, complication, or causal linkage—each sentence is an "and then" rather than "because" or "therefore." Orientation is present (grotto, star watcher, sea glass), but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous at closure: neither causal pressure nor accumulative pattern-break nor situational crystallization lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Aria is, what "the confession" entails, and why she's here remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece offers no escalation or meaningful tightening—Aria walks, kneels, receives a flower, and leaves feeling healed. No options narrow, no knowledge changes, and no cost appears on the page. The "closure" is an asserted emotional shift ("a sense of healing") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing grounded in prior causality. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words—"feral nexus" is never anchored spatially or temporally, and the mist setting offers no concrete geography or clock. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt; cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a stated completion ("she had succeeded") without visible cost or a legible change in options; the woman's approval is asserted, not dramatized. The piece reads as a single extended reflection with no because/therefore linkage—encounters happen to the protagonist (woman appears, words flow) rather than arising from her choices. No clear drive lens emerges; accumulative designs require pattern-teaching and cadence shift, neither of which is present.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the arbor setting and Elara's goal emerge gradually, but by ~120 words we lack clear "when" beyond "dawn" and what immediate problem she faces. The inferred lens is Accumulative (gathering motifs toward communal resonance), but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara's device works on first attempt, villagers arrive and sing without resistance, and the ending summarizes future intention rather than landing a decisive image with cost. The closure unit (villagers now connected) is told in summary ("smiled at one another") rather than shown through a charged final beat, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early enough, avoiding orientation debt. However, closure lacks a legible decisive change or felt cost: Aria succeeds, smiles, and vanishes without any visible price, foreclosed path, or reconfigured stake. The narrative reads as a linear accomplishment (she works → succeeds → leaves) with no meaningful tightening or reversal under any lens. The inferred lens is unclear at closure—neither causal consequence, accumulative reweighting, nor situational crystallization lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the device reactivated, Elian leaves with stored wonder), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—no option is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no trade-off dramatized. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (months pass, understanding grows), yet the final image ("stored safely in the cellar of reason") repeats the opening premise without reweighting it through on-page pressure. Escalation exists as time passing and comprehension deepening, but the decisive tightening is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the weaver is, why she carries the lamp, and what "collecting weights" means remain vague past the 120-word mark (−0.4). No causal linkage between her arrival, the weaving, and the departure; the sequence reads and-then rather than because/therefore. The ending offers no decisive change, visible cost, or stakes reconfiguration—she completes her work and leaves, with no on-page consequence or path foreclosed. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because no pattern is taught or paid off with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (widow, loft, fortnight since loss, kettle ritual) land within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the carving blank "takes shape" as grief becomes "something manageable," and the completed carving at closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via craft containment). However, the cost remains abstract—"pain slowly begin to contain"—rather than a visible forfeiture or image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The closure lands, but the felt price is muted, capping higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: "kinetic lagoon above the clouds" offers no spatial anchors by ~120 words, and the scavenger's immediate goal remains unclear until midpoint (−0.4). No causal chain links the carousel's halt to the scavenger's collection task; the piece summarizes a completed action ("had begun their peculiar task") rather than dramatizing a tightening choice. The camera-click at the end is a symbolic resolution without on-page cost or change in options. The drive lens appears Accumulative, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake—only repetition of "fragments" and "stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph 2). The closure unit—terminal restored, Maya departs with hope—qualifies as Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but cost is asserted rather than shown on the page: no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no tactical alteration tied to a specific trade-off. "Equations for hope" and the sextant's glow are conceptual summaries, not dramatized pressure. The final paragraphs loop thematic declarations instead of landing a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraphs. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elian's walk, bear encounter, and reflective return build density around the abandoned-dream stake. However, closure relies on summary告("realized," "began to see") rather than a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with legible cost. The final paragraph restates theme without a decisive on-page change or a charged image that crystallizes options. No meaningful tightening narrows his choices or alters tactics; the walk and return are additive rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks causal linkage: Lyra scans water, thinks about lies, and the sundial appears "visible in the faint moonlight" without obstacle or reversal. No on-page escalation or tightening occurs—no choice narrows options, no complication arises from her actions. Closure is asserted ("hindsight clarity," "serene upheaval") but no decisive change, renunciation, or cost is dramatized; the ending summarizes theme rather than landing a felt consequence. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly, preventing a larger penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (character role "philosophical seed collector" unclear until well into the piece; dominant stake emerges slowly). The drive lens reads accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost. The "discovery" of the knot pattern is summarized rather than dramatized, and the ending offers generic satisfaction without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. No visible cost accompanies the uncovering; the collector simply "felt a sense of satisfaction" and walks away, leaving closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the thread-snap and "peace" declaration, but no before/after stance is legible because no prior choice or pressure has been established. The piece operates in pure reflection mode without a dominant stake tested on the page. Orientation anchors who and where by the garden, but "after the last ship" remains decorative rather than a constraint that narrows options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural intent, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights material with cost—only assertion of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the piece assembles mood fragments without a legible tightening or deepening that narrows options. Closure arrives as summary assertion ("the world's rebirth") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The device's completion and the world's shift are told, not dramatized, breaking the requirement for felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "obsidian lagoon" appears early but remains spatially vague, and the radio call's scene location is unanchored until "volcanic beach" memories intrude (apply −0.4 for orientation drift). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—Aria grafts the tree without opposition, cost, or a choice that narrows options. Closure lacks visible cost: she "finished her work" and feels peace, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The ending summarizes her resolve without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the piece never delivers a meaningful tightening or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with cost; the discovery of the box and the release of memories unfold without resistance or friction. The closure unit is asserted ("liberated memories," "city's rebirth") rather than shown through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no visible price is paid on the page. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence or image at the ending beat demonstrates legible sacrifice or foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no causal linkage drives the piece—it reads as pure accumulative drift without a tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights stakes. The ending ("vanished into the depths...legacy remained") asserts resonance but provides no on-page decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing; "troubling serenity" is claimed twice but never dramatized as a friction or price. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens but delivers only steady-state description without the required pattern break or felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but "when" remains vague (dusk, then "weeks," then "hours," then unspecified night). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the carver "realizes" the shape of grief and sits in stillness, but no choice is made, no path foreclosed, and no visible cost paid. The ending recounts her insight and emotional state without dramatizing a before/after shift. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the closure unit makes a felt or conceptual price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with legible cost. Elara walks away from the clock tower toward an asserted "path to redemption," but no decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance occurs—only a declarative summary of future intention ("she was ready"). The drive lens is unclear: the pendulum metaphor suggests accumulative texture, but the narrative moves linearly without a meaningful tightening or reweighting at the end. Orientation is delayed; "who" and "where" anchor by ~150 words, and "when" remains vague throughout, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor past ~120 words without functional disorientation (−0.4). The closure reads as告知 summary ("the gardener found a sense of purpose") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost; the final image recycles prior diction without reweighting stakes. Because/therefore linkage is weak: the tapestry untangling and crystal hum do not narrow options or force a choice that forecloses a path. Drive lens remains ambiguous (Causal elements mixed with Accumulative claims) and closure cost is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.1)
    No closure occurs on the page. The final line holds the pen "still, poised on the threshold" without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—the story simply stops before its own premise activates. The repeated statement "before the pen met the blank page" frames an extended preamble with no causal escalation or visible cost. Orientation is present (who/where/when established early), but the lack of any on-page closure event with felt consequence is fatal. Drive lens reads accumulative/textural by design, but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. However, no meaningful escalation or closure cost is visible: Emilia succeeds in capturing the broadcast essence, the dust aligns, and she leaves satisfied—no path is foreclosed, no option narrows, no felt price paid. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead the piece cycles through ornamental atmospheric phrases and ends in static triumph. The broadcast's abrupt cessation and the dust's swirl gesture toward a change, but the final paragraphs summarize her satisfaction without demonstrating what she lost or risked to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no meaningful escalation occurs: Lena observes, Eli explains, Lena scatters ash, then departs—each beat is additive narration without a tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending offers only summary reflection ("comes to realize that the true value of art lies…") rather than an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never crystallizes pressure or delivers closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story lacks a clear causal spine or escalation. Kael begins in the sewer with the cog, reflects on competing narratives, and ends still reflecting with no decisive change, visible cost, or on-page shift in options or knowledge. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal turns nor accumulative deepening produce a legible closure unit. Orientation is delayed: who Kael is and why he's in the sewer remain vague past the 120-word mark, though the setting anchor (sewer, sunken city) is present early.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    No decisive change, reversal, or cost appears on the page. The piece opens with Emilia already committed to her teaching philosophy and closes with the same resolve, merely restated. The phrase "traveled stillness" recurs as a mood label but does not reconfigure options or meaning. Under an Accumulative lens, the density never shifts; under Causal, no because/therefore chain alters knowledge; under Situational, no stance crystallizes—only pre-existing conviction is reaffirmed without on-page friction or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words with no functional delay; no penalty. Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the celestial alignment and seed-planting unfold without escalation or tightening—no option narrows, no knowledge shifts, no pattern breaks. The ending presents a sprout and summarizes thematic satisfaction without an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat makes visible what Aria has forfeited or endured. Closure unit is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" and "where" anchor reasonably early, but "when" (the blackout's aftermath) and its practical effects remain vague throughout. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (the beehive investigation accumulates detail toward a thematic insight), but the closure unit—"failures preserve wonder"—lands as stated moral rather than a resonant image or reconfiguration with felt cost. The discovery that the beehive's failure is "adaptation" rather than malfunction arrives as exposition in a log, not through dramatized reversal, and the toll keeper's satisfaction is asserted without visible cost or foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening occurs; the toll keeper's goal (collect fees, then inspect) faces no opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is vague: we learn Eli's role and the bay setting, but no concrete spatial anchors ground where she starts or how far she walks. The story follows an Accumulative lens (collection of images and meditation building toward insight), but the closure—her "understanding" of the house as a living entity—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or cost. The orris root shard is clutched but never used in a way that narrows options or creates friction. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual is described but does not encounter resistance or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—statue achieves understanding and brings life to the garden—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is entirely absent: no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The "cascading revelations" trigger understanding passively (the ampoule delivers insight without struggle), and the ending asserts transformation ("thriving ecosystem") without showing what changed or what the statue sacrificed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image lacks felt weight or reweighting of prior material; it remains declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where are anchored early, but the when remains vague throughout. No causal linkage drives the ascent; the piece reads as a meditation rather than a sequence of because/therefore moves. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost—the protagonist simply "climbs on" in the same state, rendering closure absent. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; neither occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The painter begins creating, continues creating, and finishes creating with "accomplishment" and "hope" declared but no visible before/after in options, knowledge, or stance. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (rooftop greenhouse, painter, night). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but no decisive cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake; the ending restates the opening mood without reconfiguration or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to land closure with cost. The thawing chamber sequence accumulates atmospheric detail yet no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—Elena simply walks away with a vague resolve to "preserve stories." The beekeeper timeframe anchor ("after his last visit") is introduced late and never causally tightens options. Orientation is delayed: who Elena is and what stakes drive this tour remain unclear until well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed (who/where/when crystallize only after multiple paragraphs of atmospheric setup), triggering the −0.3 penalty. The piece presents a linear sequence—enter, find stone, descend, find yoyo, solve puzzle, glow—with no meaningful reversal or tightening; each step succeeds without obstacle. The "closure" is a declaration of transformation and future possibility rather than a decisive change with visible cost on the page. Under a causal lens (the dominant mode attempted here), the puzzle's solution lands off-page in summary ("the puzzle finally yielded"), and no felt price appears in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere through layered Gothic images), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the protagonist drifts through rooms collecting atmospheric details without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The blackout and awakening constitute a non-causal reset rather than closure with cost; the protagonist exits unchanged, and the "forever marked" claim is asserted, not demonstrated. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—lands on the page. The prophet performs, then vanishes; nothing reweights her options, forecloses a path, or crystallizes a stance with legible cost. The piece reads as a static tableau: blue hour → performance → departure, with no causal pressure or meaningful tightening. Orientation is present (who, where, when established early), but the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never deepens or shifts cadence to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: pressure from the watchers and the map discovery builds toward Lyra's exit. Closure is Charged Poise—she steps beyond the city's boundary with the watchers looming, options crystallized but cost felt rather than paid on the page. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (city, cartographer, expedition quest). One meaningful tightening occurs when the shell cracks and reveals the map, narrowing her path. Cost is implied through the oppressive tone and her defiance, but the final image does not make a before/after fully legible with a dramatized forfeiture; the walk forward reads as a setup for what comes next rather than a closure that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. The piece attempts a causal lens (search → find → decode → triumph) but the illuminated letter's discovery lacks motivated linkage—Emilia simply finds it in a hidden room with no prior setup of how she knew to look there or what obstacles she overcame. The closure offers a Decisive Change (truth recaptured, brought into light) but the cost is invisible on the page; the ivy "relaxing" is metaphorical decoration, not a felt price. No tightening narrows options or raises stakes between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The surveyor finishes work, departs, and leaves the inkwell behind—a circular return to stasis without visible cost or altered options. The piece presents a single documentarian task (survey the pavilion) that proceeds without reversal, tightening, or on-page friction. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early), but the absence of closure with felt cost prevents higher scoring under any inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, though the "sunken city" and "blackout above" remain abstract backdrops. The story follows a single continuous scene but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost: Elara deciphers the code, stamps the margin, and ascends with renewed purpose—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized with felt price. The narrative reads as a sequence of successful steps (causal lens inferred) but delivers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at the ending. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the final third demonstrates a visible or felt sacrifice that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "floating island tea garden" and "lantern maker" early, but the inciting pressure and timeframe anchor ("after the shadow detached") arrive only through reflective asides, never dramatized. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—lyric meditation on grief—but no meaningful tightening or pattern break occurs; the final crane release is presented, not earned by prior tactical choices. Closure lacks visible cost: releasing one crane does not foreclose a path or reweight prior stakes on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence shows what Kaito loses or sacrifices by this act.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: wedding wreckage → observatory transition lacks spatial or temporal anchors until Dr. Patel's greeting. The "hunt for answers" is told rather than dramatized; perturbation theory analysis occurs off-stage in summary ("pored over the data"). Closure attempts Charged Poise ("ready, armed with the geode crystal") but the cost is conceptual only—no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a live option. The lens reads as intended Causal but collapses into thematic summary in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (pilgrim/Lena at observatory at dusk). The dominant stake—decode the frequency—is signaled early, but the journey lacks meaningful resistance: each clue yields immediately (drone signal → chamber → carvings → chip → console display). No reversal or tightening narrows options; the search unfolds as a treasure-hunt checklist. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("frequency of belonging was...a sense of connection"), but the cost is conceptual assertion only—no visible forfeiture, tactical shift, or foreclosed path on the page. The lens reads Causal-lite but delivers Accumulative summary without density increase or cadence break at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.9)
    Orientation is delayed: protagonist role and motive emerge gradually, but spatial anchoring (terrace, then shore, then "back to her client") remains vague. The piece moves through tea-sipping, walking, examining carvings, and a resolve to return, yet no causal link tightens options—each beat could be reordered without loss. The ending offers intent ("she had a truth to uncover") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern crystallizes or cadence shifts to reweight the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established (negotiator, parapet, stalled talks), but the drive lens remains ambiguous—accumulative imagery competes with causal claims ("time for breakthrough was near," "began to flow") that are asserted rather than dramatized. The closure unit is a summary: "negotiations...began to flow...now began to flow...talks concluded." No on-page reversal, decision, or image reweights prior material with felt cost; the breakthrough happens off-stage between paragraphs. Lens ambiguity and summary-only closure trigger Q2 cap at 7.2 and cross-category cap at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV, fitting default scope. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (hope rekindled, new path forward), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. The kayak paddle sequence offers a micro-turn (calm washing over him) but the ending restates theme rather than delivering a charged final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (who/where) by the opening and signals a journey structure, but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs. Lena walks along the lake, finds a baseball, interprets a cryptic message, and walks further—a sequence of "and then" beats without causal pressure or narrowed options. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; she vanishes "lost in the labyrinth" with only metaphorical stakes and no visible cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the piece loops description and metaphor without a final image that charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph and remain stable. The piece attempts a Decisive Change (Lyra's metamorphosis) but the transformation is asserted through abstract language ("her essence merging," "expansion, a growth") without showing what具体 option or relationship Lyra loses or gains—no on-page cost is legible. The ritual sequence follows causal steps (spices → chanting → apparition → transformation), but Lyra's agency at closure is passive reception rather than a choice that narrows options. The ending's "sense of wonder" substitutes emotional summary for a charged final image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who (cartomancer) and where (midnight glade) early, satisfying orientation. Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the story accumulates symbols (cards, saucer, hand-tracings) toward a final image of "cloudbound repentance." However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the cartomancer "felt a sense of peace" and "vanished," but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, and the cost remains assertion rather than dramatized consequence. The closure unit lacks the required felt or conceptual price that would reconfigure prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit appears on the page. The "locked dimension" simply "creaks open" after stitching is complete, with no visible cost, forfeiture, or reconfigured stakes—the protagonist floats into happiness without dramatized consequence. Causality is opaque: stitching photographs somehow unlocks dimensions via unspecified mechanics. The Orientation Test is marginal (who/where anchor by ~150 words) but the piece never establishes what "shadow work" means in action or how tears on photos function as a method, leaving the drive lens ambiguous through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story offers spatial anchors (black sand beach, volcano) early, but causality dissolves into drift. Aria wanders, feels nudges, finds a rock, meets a woman who hands her a bottle—each beat is additive rather than because/therefore linked. The "closure" is told transformation ("she would never see the world in the same way again") without a visible decision, refusal, or image that reweights prior material with cost. No clear dominant lens emerges; the piece toggles between situational mood and causal gestures without committing, and the ending summarizes theme rather than landing a change.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is unclear past 120 words: who the sentinel is, what "cradle of sparks" concretely entails, and why a blackout matters remain vague throughout (−0.4). The closure—activating the artifact and spreading a message—occurs without on-page cost; the revolution succeeds in summary with no visible forfeiture, resistance, or price paid. The inferred lens wobbles between attempted Causal (blackout → action) and Accumulative (light imagery), but neither coheres because no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs. The figure's message ("The time for silence is over") is received and acted upon instantly, flattening any potential turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (aurora, stardust, painted rocks accrue symbolic weight), but no meaningful tightening occurs—the herder searches, finds, arranges, succeeds without reversal or cost. Closure is asserted ("task complete," "secrets revealed") rather than shown through a decisive image or reweighted pattern. The vision "burst forth" is told, not dramatized, and no felt price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure form is unclear: the poet reads a letter and "feels understanding," but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing is legible on the page—only assertion of inner peace. The vigil structure implies Accumulative or Situational pressure, yet no tightening or pattern-break reweights the stake; the storm "rages on" while she stands static until the envelope arbitrarily delivers resolution. Orientation is delayed: "censored poet," "remote outpost," and the storm's cause remain vague past the opening third, and the spatial anchor (observatory mechanics, how she arrived) never clarifies. The lens wavers between lyric accumulation and a causal letter-reveal without teaching either pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens inferred as Causal, but the duel's outcome is summarized rather than dramatized—"it was Aurélien who stood tall" without on-page turning points that narrow options. The "hidden overture" is mentioned repeatedly but never functions as a constraint or tactic; it's told to be revealed "in all its glory" without showing what it was or how it changed the conflict. Orientation is present (glass atrium, brook, waiting), but the closure lacks felt cost: Aurélien wins, smiles, walks away with no visible forfeiture or stance shift. The final reflection ("the true victory lay…in the journey") replaces scene pressure with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, library steps, moon rising) arrive early, but causality remains weak throughout: the poet decides to rebuild, walks inside, works through the night, and the library is reborn—all without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or visible cost. The piece reads as outline-level sequencing ("As the night wore on... With a newfound sense of purpose... The poet stepped back") without because/therefore linkage. No closure effect (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is legible; the ending offers emotional declaration ("the city was on the path to healing") rather than a dramatized shift in options or stance. The inferred lens (Causal) is not sustained; events accumulate without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with atmospheric mist and music, anchoring the arbor setting, but "who" remains vague (pianist identity, why alone, what was lost). The film-reel refuge offers a potential Resonant Reconfiguration, but the return to the arbor in the final third lacks visible cost—she "smiled to herself" and her "heart was no longer heavy," which reads as a soft reset rather than a foreclosed path or crystallized stance. The Orientation Test passes minimally (arbor, pianist, mist established early), but the causal link between playing, threading the reel, and emotional release remains atmospheric rather than motivated by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story provides orientation (who/where/when) within bounds. However, no meaningful closure occurs: Aria completes her task exactly as planned with no reversal, decision under pressure, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The monsoon arrives on schedule, the work is "done," and she vanishes—a summary of success rather than a dramatized change in options or stance. The accumulative lens is never taught; the piece reads as linear task completion without pattern-driven reweighting or conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story accrues symbolic objects and reflective motifs. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. However, closure relies on ritual release without dramatized cost—Kaito wraps and tosses the compass, then returns "clearer" via assertion. No on-page reversal or deepening narrows options; the ending recounts emotional shift rather than enacting it. The felt cost required for RR is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds strong with a clear sequence from the fallen wall to seed distribution, and closure lands with a decisive change—flourishing fields—and felt cost in the liberator's risk and effort. The arrow signal is a minor convenience, but orientation is early and transitions are legible, supporting coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clear early, and the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and memories. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the sound "resonated deep within Lyra's chest."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise with Lumina feeling "one step closer to understanding destiny," reconfiguring options under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds, but the cost is subtle and not deeply felt, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elian's renewed purpose, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The drive lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the thawing heart metaphor shapes the final image of hope in abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages: discovery of betrayal leads to library search, decryption, and decisive change. Closure lands on-page with cost ("trembling certainty" and peace), orienting who, where, when early. No causality breaks; one meaningful tightening via note revelation reconfigures options.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the world transformed and cost legible in the unsettling stillness. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though causality is loose but appropriate for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Zeta understands its emergent sentience, under an accumulative/textural lens. The looped timelines build patternically toward this insight, with cost legible in the acceptance of experiential growth. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. However, the causality in loops is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (peace and purpose found). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, oriented early. The crystal monolith and lens transformation charge the ending without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the garden flourishing and the dresser's bond affirmed, felt cost in the "bittersweet aroma" and cyclical renewal. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned details like marble polishing and garden growth. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Decisive Change as Kaelin travels sideways through time and returns transformed, with cost legible in her "tingling" hands and changed perspective.

Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—Rachel's peace and transformation are legible on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern intensification through water damage and music. Orientation is clear early, and the final image reweights prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: Aria's realization that truth is fluid reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns like the illustration and data streams. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the illustration shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands decisively with the logbook discovery, reweighting the swallowed truth with conceptual cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and persistence of the tunnel's constraints shapes tactics. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the satisfaction and clarity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) during the eclipse peak, cost legible in "cautious exuberance"; accumulative lens holds with density increase through sensory and emotional layers.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is Earned Stasis with legible cost in "sense of completion." Orientation is clear early, but the cost remains subtle, lacking a vivid on-page moment that charges the ending decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with closure as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost of life change is conceptual and not vividly felt on-page, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Aria's worldview shift, but the Accumulative lens holds weakly due to over-reliance on coincidence (e.g., old woman's abrupt appearance) rather than character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Causal lens holds with logical linkages from blackout to revolution. Closure is a decisive change with implied cost, but the cost is vague ("darkness vanquished") and not deeply felt. Orientation is clear early, but the sundial method feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the vision reveals secrets with felt cost ("weight of unfulfilled prophecies lifted"). Under the accumulative lens, pattern-building coheres, and orientation is clear early, but the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset: we know who she is, where she is, and why. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens, moving through observations that build toward a quiet realization about decay and gradual change. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she frames decay and dust as creative forces and finds peace in that—but the before/after line is subtle and low-stakes, with minimal sense of real loss or narrowed options. The structure is coherent but reads closer to a reflective vignette than a story with meaningful turns.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Structure is linear and easy to follow: she sits in the canyon, studies the ledger, reads the frost, and leaves with a new sense of purpose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated pairing of ledger and frost does build toward a closure image, but the causal chain is soft—discoveries don’t create new constraints or reversals. The survival backstory is inert in structural terms, and “deciding to retrace her ancestors’ steps” remains largely a stated intention. Closure is present as a reconfiguration of purpose, but with almost no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene: she arrives, they collaborate using the device and tuning forks, they achieve a silent symphony, then part. Causality is intact but very gentle, with the only real “problem” being abstract discord in their composition, resolved smoothly via adjustment. Closure exists as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves with renewed strength and shared art—but the cost is faint and mostly asserted. The catastrophe and world-silence are backstory rather than active structural pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is legible: mysterious package → journey preparation → descent → discovery → repair → long-term guardianship, and there is a clear before/after reconfiguration. However, many crucial beats (“He spent weeks preparing,” “Years passed”) are summarized rather than dramatized, so turns feel low-friction. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/RR, but the cost of staying undersea is conceptual rather than concretely felt. The structure is linear and clean but reads more like an outline of a richer story than a fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    Structure is linear and easy to follow: a meeting at the arbor frames reflective summary of past efforts and then a reaffirmation at the end. The dominant drive is accumulative/textural, but escalation is mild and there’s no sharp turn—events feel more like a warm recap than a scene of mounting pressure. Closure exists as an Earned Stasis/stance crystallization (“we will not be broken”), but it doesn’t substantially reconfigure the situation. Causality is intact yet underpowered, with few because/therefore links beyond basic setup → speech → dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a simple, linear accumulative structure: Aria contemplates, meets the pilgrim, undergoes a breathing ritual, and reaches an internal resolution. Closure is present as a conceptual re-framing of her “unused love” and past-life pain, but the causal chain is weak—events feel like ordained steps rather than pressured choices. There’s no real risk that anything will go differently once the pilgrim arrives; escalation is more declared than dramatized. Still, the movement from restless longing to peaceful integration reads coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrival → contact with fragment → retrocognitive experience → conceptual realization → decision about future work. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does build from calm description toward a more charged, visionary state. However, the closure is more a restatement of intention than a decisive reconfiguration with cost; Elian begins as someone seeking the “texture of time” and ends still seeking, only slightly reframed. Many developments are simply asserted (“they were retrocognitively trapped”) rather than arising from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: wall falls → piano code → seed vault → distribution → transformed city. However, almost all key beats (infiltrating the guarded vault, impeding controlling forces) are summarized instead of dramatized, so turns lack felt consequence. Closure exists—the city’s transformation and the liberator’s fading into the crowd—but cost is essentially absent; nothing concrete is lost or truly risked on the page. The piece reads like a high-level synopsis of a richer story rather than a fully staged arc.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens: Lyra works on the prototype, recalls her mother, refines the device, then achieves the imprint and a quiet resolution. Causality is very soft—nothing surprising happens, and there is no clear inciting event or midpoint turn beyond “she continues to calibrate until it works.” Closure exists (she imprints the sound and feels a new, calmer stance) but the cost is understated and mostly asserted. Structural repetition (“as the night wore on,” “even in the darkest moments”) underscores the static, meditative feel rather than a shaped progression.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: arrive at station → spot couple → notice jar/flowers → decode message → take photo → leave with jar, feeling closer to destiny. This functions on an accumulative/textural lens, with the flower code as a mild turn and the final walk away as a quiet Charged Poise closure. However, the global drive (what concretely is at stake for Lumina tonight) stays vague, and the story loops its thesis (“secrets,” “destiny,” “illuminated moments”) without a significant structural deepening. The closure image is legible but low-cost and reads more like a continuation of mood than a decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/lyric vignette where mood and metaphor build rather than a causal plot, and orientation (who/where/when) is clean. Still, there’s minimal structural movement: Elian begins already dedicated to crafting safe zones, and the “task at hand” (abandon the familiar) is announced but not meaningfully tested. Closure arrives as a quiet reaffirmation rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The before/after axis is perceptible but thin: a thawing already in progress is simply restated as calling found.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is clean: he searches the library, finds the shell and cast, decrypts the note, receives the phrase, and chooses a new stance—causal linkage is clear and linear. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “the truth is in the shadows” reframes his self-concealment and leads to the decision to “walk out… into a brighter future,” but the cost of this turn is lightly sketched. The decoding process lacks concrete obstacles or tactical adaptation; it’s summarized as effort rather than dramatized pressure. Overall functional, but too frictionless for a top-tier short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from storm to ritual to darkness to altered world, landing in a resonant reconfiguration where her map seems to have reshaped reality. Causality is soft but legible: listening → narrating → deepening darkness → reordered shadows → a slightly lighter world. Still, there’s no real obstacle or risk that might derail this process, so progression feels inevitable rather than pressured. Closure exists but with minimal on-page cost, which keeps the structural impact modest.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is basically accumulative: courtyard sweeping and contemplation interwoven with explanatory backstory, leading to a conceptual realization about emergent sentience. Causality is soft—events in the loops are gestured at but not dramatized, so the path from experiment to insight is more stated than organically traced. Closure exists (Zeta conceptually reprices the origin of its thoughts), but the cost is faint and mostly abstract. The piece risks feeling like a static meditation rather than a sequence of pressures changing options.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece functions as a single accumulative scene: she reflects, walks, reads tickets, uses the lens, and arrives at a resolved stance. Causality is soft but coherent—each object (tickets, lens, monolith) loosely leads to the next reflection and culminates in the lens-assisted “clarity.” Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration: she adopts the role of “guardian” of a now-honest city, but there’s no visible cost or external test of that stance. Structurally it holds together, yet the lack of concrete obstacles or consequences keeps it from feeling narratively decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/lyric vignette: scenes of tending and polishing stack toward a quiet closure where the dresser finds purpose and vanishes into the maze. Orientation is clear, but causality is minimal, with little sense of before/after beyond “once symbol of decay” → “guardian of life.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is abstract; the “mended deception” and past life outside the garden are hinted at without concrete dramatized stakes. Structure is coherent but too static for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: repair simulator → simulate nexus → touch nexus → sideways-time experience → return with new knowledge. Structure holds as a single continuous sequence with one clear speculative rupture and a tidy return. Closure exists (her theory is proven and her stance reconfigured), but the cost of this breakthrough is barely gestured at, so the before/after feels conceptually neat rather than pressured. Several set-ups (the winged creatures, xenobiology context) never meaningfully complicate or alter the main causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Rachel discovers the program, suspects a code, experiments with water, and receives a message that gives her peace. Causality is soft but intact, leaning heavily on a magical-lyric logic where the opera house and water simply “respond” to her. Closure exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves changed and with a new sense of inner alignment—but the path to that shift is almost frictionless. The drive lens is mainly accumulative/textural rather than truly plot-driven, which limits impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Aria arrives post-fever, investigates via the logbook and data, and reaches a conceptual repricing about truth and uncertainty. Causality is soft but consistent—each phase of inquiry (margins, collaboration, pattern recognition) leads to the final realization. However, the piece lacks a sharp structural tightening or turn; it feels like a smooth essayistic drift rather than a narrative beat sequence with a clear before/after under pressure. Closure is present but low-cost and heavily summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: deeper into tunnel → radio → valve wheel → logbook → realization. However, most beats accrete mood rather than tighten options; the logbook appears conveniently and delivers a “cryptic entry” that is not dramatized in detail, softening the sense of consequential causality. Closure technically exists (a before/after in the narrator’s understanding), but the cost and concrete stakes of that shift remain vague. The accumulative lens is consistent, yet the decisive turn feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows a largely accumulative/textural lens: watch, divine, feel drawn, then burrow and remain as guardian. Closure is an Earned Stasis of sorts—choosing to stay in regenerative silence—but the cost of that choice (what is lost, foreclosed, or reweighted) is only faintly implied and never sharpened. The middle stretch reiterates the same state (watching across untold seasons, crumbling peace) rather than tightening pressure toward that final stance. Structure is coherent and oriented, but the decisive before/after line is soft and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: Aria at Sage Ridge, Eli’s arrival, the shared eclipse, and a reflective exit. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the eclipse functions as a gentle crest of intensity, but causality is soft—events follow one another without real pressure or complication. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration (Aria believes she’s nurtured Eli’s wonder), yet the “before/after” line is faint and nearly costless. Nothing important threatens to go otherwise at any point, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a simple, linear structure: arrival, discovery of tapestry and diaries, immersive reading, and departure. As an accumulative/textural design it achieves a mild resonance, but stakes and turns remain flat—there is no decisive change in options or knowledge, only deepened mood. Closure technically exists (she adds this tale to her collection and leaves) but the cost is negligible and largely asserted. Causality is intact and orientation is clear, yet the story reads more like a vignette than a fully shaped arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: tavern → encounter with stranger → dawn departure → return to writing, with no orientation issues. The inferred lens is mostly Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is weak: the stranger arrives, they talk, and we’re repeatedly told this is transformative without any specific turn. Closure is a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—the Oracle now writes in a “new reality”—but the cost or concrete before/after in options is barely sketched. Many sentences restate the same beat (“life would never be the same,” “new key”) instead of advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative ritual scene: soundscape builds, whispers intensify, then quiet closure with the stillness “unraveled” and possession averted. Causality is mostly declarative (“the possession…had been averted”) rather than dramatized, and the supposed world-scale stake only appears late. Closure exists conceptually, but the lack of on-page struggle or price keeps the structure from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, lyric scene with one primary movement: arrival → mapping → a quiet realization → departure. Causality is simple but coherent, with no orientation issues: dawn and the environment prompt the ritual, which culminates in a self-declaration as “conductor of unheard symphonies.” However, there is little in the way of a decisive turn; time “bending” and exhaustion approaching are mentioned but never materially change options. Closure qualifies as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is faint and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal spine is simple and coherent: study tablet → enter labyrinth → integrate echoes → emerge transformed. However, nearly all turns are summarized rather than dramatized, so beats blur into an even wash of progress with little sense of concrete obstacles or tactical shifts. Closure is present (she exits the labyrinth having aligned fractured timelines and claimed power), but the cost of this resolution never materializes on the page. The chosen lens reads chiefly as accumulative/textural, yet escalation remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece functions under an accumulative/textural lens: one extended scene across a long implied timespan, with repeated motifs (seasons, hush, cavern, needle) building toward a reconfigured emotional state. Orientation is clear early—who she is, where she is, roughly when—and remains stable. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: numbness recedes and she chooses a steady, contemplative stasis in the cavern, but the cost of that choice is only lightly implied. Some beats feel redundant, circling the same state rather than tightening or reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain (pigeon → message → deduction → resolve) is clear, but nearly all of the potentially dramatic middle (decoding the cryptic note, assessing danger, considering options) is summarized rather than staged. The story lands a form of closure—she chooses a path forward—but the cost and concrete implications of that choice are vague. There’s no meaningful complication or tightening beyond the initial shiver of being watched; the sense of danger never escalates on the page. Structure is coherent but reads like a static vignette rather than a line of driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: tending plants → memory trigger via vial → emotional release → quiet resolution. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats do build toward a closure moment where Elara’s stance toward her memories reconfigures, and that before/after is legible. However, there’s essentially no real turn beyond “she grieves and then feels better,” and the emotional cost of that shift is underplayed. The result is coherent but relatively flat in terms of structural tension and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric: one continuous night of stone-patterning and reflection that leads to a quiet conceptual shift. There is a loose before/after—she arrives seeking, leaves with a sense that time’s texture is “both rough and smooth”—but the cost and decisive change are faint. Many paragraphs restate the same idea (nexus, patterns, impossible choices) without adding new causal pressure or knowledge. Closure qualifies as a soft resonant reconfiguration, but not a structurally taut one.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward: burned rainforest → discovery of greenhouse and bowl → bonfire gathering → music that shifts the hush. The structure is essentially one continuous progression with a legible before/after: isolation versus connection, silence versus sound. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, but the cost of the change (what’s irrevocably lost or foreclosed) remains conceptually soft. There are no orientation issues, but escalation is more implied than structurally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural vignette rather than a causal arc: one extended preparation scene followed by departure. Orientation and lens are clear, and there is a mild closure beat when she leaves with her work completed and feels peace. However, there is no real tightening or turn; nothing happens that reconfigures options or stakes. The ending reads as a gentle cadence rather than a resonant revaluation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: library visit → locket discovery → Sophia connection → project idea. Closure exists in Lena’s decision to begin a community project, but the cost of that choice is not dramatized. The mistaken-envelope device is late and slightly over-explained, functioning as tidy coincidence rather than lived complication. Overall, the structure is clean but soft, more a pleasant anecdote than a driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: isolation → search for tag → inspiration → new arbor → community acceptance. Structure is linear and coherent, with one main excursion (the search) feeding the later artistic decision and presentation. Closure technically lands via a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael gains belonging, but the path is almost frictionless—no failed attempts, setbacks, or meaningful costs complicate the throughline. As a result, the ending reads emotionally thin for a piece that purports to be about hard-won connection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear: rooftop observation → spell to borrow time → expanded perception → discovery of echo-vortex → return to normal cadence. Causality is coherent, but every step works on the first try, so the global drive reads more like a smooth ritual than a pressured sequence of narrowing options. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—Lyra’s relationship to city/time/art is reweighted—yet the cost of this transformation is faint and mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: walk through orchard → ritual at the stone → realization → quiet exit. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual and rising stillness provide a modest tightening, and the ending reconfigures the orchard from loss to possibility, which gives the piece closure. However, causality is shallow—almost nothing meaningfully resists or complicates her goal—so the climax feels more like a gentle reveal than a hard-won turn. The cost of the new understanding remains largely theoretical rather than concretely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: routine → discovery → memory → renewed purpose → rumor of presence, but the causal links are soft and mostly descriptive. Closure qualifies as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—by the end, the dweller’s unseen guardianship has become a rumor and a felt presence—but the before/after shift is subtle and low-cost. There’s essentially one structural “turn” when the tape triggers memory and “renewed purpose,” yet the stakes or options don’t visibly change in concrete ways. The outline-like progression (“As… As… And then…”) creates a smooth but low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative, lyric meditation more than a causal plot, and that mode is consistent. There is a before/after—Emilia moves from anxious restlessness to a resolved commitment—but the path is a series of declarative realizations rather than dramatized turns. Closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost is only lightly implied. Structural repetition (trellis/leaf/storm) provides cohesion but also flattens dynamic progression.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal line is coherent: find brooch → investigate → meet stranger → gain explanation → create painting. The piece delivers closure via a conceptual repricing: the brooch and island acquire new meaning, culminating in the painting “Convergence.” However, much of the central “action” is summarized investigation and lore-dumping rather than dramatized beats under pressure. The cost of the exchange and the impact of new knowledge are stated rather than structurally stressed, limiting the power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: pilgrim arrives with pearl → Aria accepts and explores deeper → she gains expanded clairvoyance and a new understanding. Causality is intact but very gentle; no beat genuinely forecloses options or complicates her path. Closure lands conceptually, with a clear before/after in her self-conception, but the shift is more declarative insight than dramatized turning point with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is essentially linear: discovery of the valve → plan for installations → communal healing → retrospective coda, with a clear before/after in the harbor’s state. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, but most turns are summarized rather than dramatized, so causal beats blur into a soft “and then” sequence. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration (harbor reclaimed, trumpet valve reweighted), though cost is more implied than felt. Because conflict is low and many steps are told in overview (“In the years to come…”), the arc feels conceptually coherent but dramatically underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow—enter vault → follow arrows → find fortress → emerge changed—so orientation and basic causality are sound. However, the beats feel like a sequence of scenic restatements rather than escalating turns, with no real obstacle or complication between entry and success. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (she now sees the world differently), but there is no on-page cost attached to this shift. Many setups (e.g., the ticket punch’s power) never pay off in concrete consequences, softening structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Emilia finds the tile, transcribes over “days,” uncovers a hidden narrative, and reaches a peaceful closure. Under a textural lens, the progression from discovery to comprehension to reconfigured perception is legible, but each phase arrives without complication or surprise. Closure qualifies as a quiet resonant reconfiguration—she descends changed—but cost is faint and largely conceptual. The “entangled memories” premise never materially complicates her process, keeping the arc relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: storm → energy weaving → fragment activation → duplicate’s appearance → realization and departure. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing—Kael reinterprets “goodbye” and steps into the multiverse—but the price of this change is abstract and low-stakes on the page. Causality is intact but basic; events feel like a smooth escalation of cool effects rather than pressured decisions. The lack of concrete obstacles or consequences keeps the ending from landing with more structural force.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece is structurally clear: one continuous scene with a simple causal chain (negotiation → proposed breach → readiness to act) and a Charged Poise closure. However, the crucial negotiation and the specifics of the “breach of protocol” all occur or exist off-page, so the felt stakes and mechanics of the turn stay abstract. Closure is present—Lena commits internally to risk—but the cost and changed options are more told than visibly tightened. The drive reads as a Causal/Situational hybrid, held consistently but never pushed to its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is essentially a single accumulative/textural pass: charting the lamp’s hum at dawn, then continuing to gather textures in the forest. There is a minimal before/after—night-to-morning, hum rising then fading, notebook filling, and the promise of “new stories” in the final line—but the closure is gentle and low-cost. Causality is clean (no orientation problems), yet the “turn” is more a fade-out than a decisive reconfiguration. The global drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and it holds, but the final cadence doesn’t materially reweight what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens, moving from wandering in the container maze to having “their task complete.” That arc is coherent and closure-adjacent (a conceptual repricing: from confusion to clarity about erased histories), but there is almost no on-page turn beyond simple progression. Beats often repeat the same information (collecting fragments, layering stories, tides as metronome) rather than tightening. Structure is legible and non-confusing, yet lacks a decisive, charged shift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story is structurally coherent and easy to follow: she arrives, performs a ritual with shell and cello, accesses a mystical realm, and emerges with the compass/understanding. However, the causal chain is loose and ritualistic rather than pressured—nothing meaningfully resists her or complicates the process. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she now “knows” and the observatory feels changed), but there is no visible price for this revelation. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, yet escalation remains mostly a matter of repeated intensifiers rather than consequential turns.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: threat of privatization → Ava devises graffiti strategy → the city unites in resistance, ending in a charged poise (“stood ready”). However, the story is almost entirely summarized; beats blur together and there are no distinct on-page turns where options narrow or consequences bite. Closure functions conceptually (community now prepared to fight) but cost remains abstract and un-felt. The drive lens is mostly accumulative/textural but the accumulation is relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a straightforward causal line—arrival, discovery, warning, documentation, departure—with a clear if gentle closure as Elara leaves having completed her task. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with the Dr. Patel message giving a mild tightening of urgency. There’s an on-page resolution (she succeeds in capturing the flora before extinction) but little sense of real jeopardy or sacrifice. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, which works but keeps the impact modest.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: drone arrives broken, Emilia uses her method, the drone is fixed as the external ship event parallels completion. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of mist, water, light, and vibration coheres, and the closure—“now fully functional” drone and brightened world—reads cleanly. However, the core drive stays flat; no beat truly narrows options or forces a new tactic, so the change is more procedural completion than reconfigured stakes. Cost at closure is minimal, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal spine is simple and legible—arrive at outpost → notice condensation pattern → decipher it → set out across the lake—but the sequence feels more like a report of steps than a tightening plot. The decoding of the “cryptic message” is handled in summary with no real on-page struggle, and nothing pushes back against her goal. Closure lands as a modest Charged Poise image (first step onto the ice, journey beginning) but lacks a clear before/after cost or decisive reconfiguration of options. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural rather than truly causal, with minimal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens: the walk, the vibrations, and the fork’s hum slowly build toward the town’s faint response. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration: by dawn, the town has begun to stir, and the work continues with a new sense of possibility. However, structurally it is almost entirely flat; no meaningful turn or complication shifts options, and the “before/after” is conceptually clear but emotionally gentle. The lack of any disruptive beat or cost limits structural force.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and intact: Kael enters, works to untangle energy, reaches the heart, harnesses it, and exits with a preserved device. Closure is clear—a decisive change where the energy is captured and the temple falls silent, with a legible emotional cost. However, many beats are summarized rather than dramatized (“slowly beginning to untangle the knots that had formed over the centuries”), softening the sense of concrete obstacles and tactical shifts. Structure is clean but reads like a synopsis of a more textured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.0)
    The structure is a linear walk from reef edge to central door, oriented clearly in space but with almost no escalation beyond deepening description. The implied “before they found the bodies” clock is introduced late and never affects tactics or forces a turn, undercutting its potential as a structural hinge. Closure lands on a mild Charged Poise—the boy deciding to continue deeper—but the before/after is conceptually soft and costless. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern (approach → corridor → heart-door) is coherent but lacks a decisive reweighting at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal spine is straightforward and legible: bead → ghost appears → bead taken → greenhouse awakens → ghost’s debt begins to resolve. However, nearly everything is summarized, with few discrete beats where options or tactics change under pressure, so escalation feels more told than experienced. Closure does land—the ghost’s debt is “slowly being repaid” and the alchemist’s stance is reconfigured—but the cost is mostly conceptual, not dramatized. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the accumulative/lyric drive is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: one night of weaving accumulates toward the finished tapestry, and closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the labyrinth’s meaning shifts from ruin to promise. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and it holds. However, cost is only lightly gestured at (“weight of her task”) and never crystallized in a concrete decision or loss. Much of the middle repeats the same state (she weaves / she hopes) without a strong tightening beat before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, moving from arrival to extended excavation to reflective closure, with no orientation problems. The drive is largely accumulative/textural: repeated scenes of digging and discovering deepen her connection, culminating in the final survey of the tomb. Causality is soft—very few because/therefore turns, and almost no on-page dilemmas that alter options. Closure does land as a resonant reconfiguration (she has re-established faith/belonging), but the cost and turning-point moments are underdeveloped and mostly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, but structurally it’s essentially one static beat: Cipher prepares and mails a letter. Causality is fine line-to-line, yet there is no meaningful turn or complication—no obstacle to the mailing, no new information about the recipient, no reversal. Closure is a soft resonant reconfiguration at best (the letter enters the world), but the before/after difference is modest and the cost nearly invisible. The result reads more like an extended vignette than a fully shaped story for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, anchored in one continuous situation, but functions more as a static meditation than a sequence of pressured beats. Discovery of conspiracies and “uncovering secrets” is summarized rather than enacted, so cause-and-effect feels abstract. Closure exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chart is completed, the secrets are “known,” and the coup looms—but the decisive change is largely intellectual and low-cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, yet the build to closure feels more like reiterated restatement than a tightening of circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: Aria moves through the labyrinth → reaches the window → evokes the entity → experiences a soft reconfiguration at the end. Causality within this frame is coherent and the closure (Aria altered by the encounter, burden slightly lifted) is legible, but the cost is modest and mostly conceptual. The middle lacks a distinct tightening turn beyond “entity appears and grows more substantial,” which keeps the escalation fairly gentle. Still, the story maintains a clear through-line and does not suffer from orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens: anesthetic deepens, she studies coral, decrypts the cast, then settles into peace. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—her stance toward her anxieties shifts—but the change feels almost frictionless, with little on-page resistance or concrete complication. Beat-to-beat progression often loops the same emotional state in new wording, softening structural momentum. Causality is legible but minimal: the child’s message causes her reframing, yet the lack of dramatized process blunts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear-lyric with a mild frame: exploration in the orchard, discovery of the fragment, then a dissolve into studio work and closure on the completed mural and renewed joy. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does cohere and land a clear before/after (creative block vs. reawakened creativity), so closure is present, albeit soft. Causality is more implied than driven—events feel like “and then” rather than “therefore,” especially the transition from orchard to easel/daydream. There is no serious plot amnesia or orientation trouble, but also no meaningful structural tightening beyond the final recap.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: a continuous scene that moves from routine restoration to experimental disruption and then to transformed perception, with a legible before/after. Causality is intact (arranging mirrors → sound feedback loop → mural and perception change), and the piece reads as a Hybrid with strong accumulative/textural tendencies. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—she revalues curiosity over certainty—but the cost is mostly asserted, not felt, and external stakes remain minimal. There are no major orientation issues, but escalation and the magnitude of change never fully match the ambitious rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece functions more as an expository vignette than a plotted story: Lyra obtains a seed, plants it, and the rest is summarized aftermath with no real turns. Causality is broadly coherent (thought-tax → secret club → garden code) but lacks on-page beats where options narrow or consequences bite. Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing/legacy image—the mature plant dispersing seeds—but the before/after cost is minimal and mostly asserted. There is no orientation problem, only a structural flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece works on an accumulative/lyric lens: postcard → reflection on armistice and longing → singing/writing → earned stasis in renewed purpose. Closure is present in the reconfiguration of the shell from prison to womb and the easing of her vigil. Still, the progression is very smooth; few new options or constraints arise, so the before/after line, while legible, lacks sharpness and cost. Structurally it’s coherent and continuous but relatively low in dramatic contour.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is essentially a single, continuous lyrical scene with a clean orientation and a faint arc from tending to singing to quiet afterglow. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece does land on a gentle resonant reconfiguration—she reaffirms her ongoing task with slightly heightened poignancy. However, there is minimal sense of before/after cost; nothing in her options or situation truly changes. Repetition of ideas (“preserve the sound of forgotten names”) substitutes for structural development.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is largely linear and coherent: Elara works, recalls her failure, makes meaning from the current text, and exits with a renewed stance. Under an accumulative/textural lens the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she reinterprets her silence and restores some inner trust—but the price for this shift sits mostly in off-page backstory. The “before paths diverge” warning, which could inject real structural pressure, never concretely alters her options or forces a hard choice. As a result, the piece reads more like a mood vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric rather than causal, with a steady layering of atmosphere and reflection but almost no concrete turns in circumstance. The encrypted message and the chain are presented as already-solved or in-progress problems, so we skip over the actual struggle and choice-work that would create structural tension. Closure exists as a quiet realization that she has “found the key to harmonizing the conflicting values,” but there is no visible cost or narrowed option. The result is structurally coherent but dramatically flat, with setup promises (history vs safety) largely unanswered in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, lyric slice: one continuous scene framed by pigeons and dust motes, anchored clearly in the attic. There is a loose throughline (Emilia working, reflecting, ritualizing, and reaching peace) but little causal escalation; most movement is reflective restatement rather than turns. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—she affirms her balance and readiness—but the cost of that stance is only faintly implied. Overall structure is coherent and oriented, yet too static for high-level literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: wandering, decoding, then reunion, with the logbook leading to a hidden path and to the father. Causality is simple but present—code → path → father—but there is little sense of real risk or alternative outcomes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator now reads the world’s thresholds as meaningful and feels orientated, but the cost is barely legible. Structure is coherent yet flat, with no major tightening or reversal beyond “the symbols began to reveal their secrets.”

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a simple line: arrival, sensing/ritual, realization, departure, with a clear before/after in the astrologer’s state. Under an accumulative/textural lens, this is coherent, but the “beats” are largely rephrasings of the same action rather than genuine turns. The closure—a quiet RR where the astrologer departs with new inner light—is legible but low-impact, with minimal sense of risk or alternative outcomes. Repetitive phrasing (“the luminous respite… would stay with them”) flattens structure rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal spine (seeds → trail → dense crystals → symbols → realization) is coherent and easy to follow, with a clear before/after understanding about the disappearing paths. The drive lens is mainly accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what paths and memory mean. However, the path to the chamber is almost frictionless: each new element appears and resolves its own micro-problem without resistance. The cost of the discovery is minimal, so the structural arc feels more like a gentle walk-through than a pressured progression.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow—set-up between shows, performance, aftermath, then another performance—but reads more like a vignette than a story with a decisive turn. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the accumulation is mostly repetition of the same idea (orchestrated serendipity) rather than a pattern that reconfigures meaning at the end. Closure is a soft reaffirmation of his mission as he sets up again; there is no clear before/after marked by cost. The “heavier” bishop hints at future change but remains an uncashed setup.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: a single continuous scene that builds from stillness to dance to inscription and departure. Causality is simple but legible (garden → moonstone pull → dance → verse appears → she leaves), and closure is present in the transformation from blocked seeker to someone who has achieved her artistic goal. However, the cost of this change is faint and most beats feel like a smooth, expected progression rather than pressured turns. The “nostalgia ban” and exile concept are introduced but never create structural complications or decisive constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.0)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric vignette: one continuous scene, cleanly oriented, that circles a single contemplative state. Causality is minimal—the only external event (the fisherman’s stone) sparks reflection but doesn’t alter options or stakes. Closure is a mild resonant reconfiguration as she reaffirms her role and walks away, but there is no clear cost or before/after shift beyond “I will keep doing what I already do.” Structurally coherent but too static for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece functions as a single, continuous, accumulative scene: walking, opening the box, looking in the mirror, reflecting, and re-labeling himself at the end. There is closure in the sense of a conceptual repricing—Kael reframes his pain as universal and adopts a new self-conception as messenger—but the change feels unpressured and nearly costless. Causality is simple “and then” progression, with no meaningful structural turn beyond “he opens the box and remembers things.” The reflective sections dominate without altering his options in a tangible way, so the structure feels static despite a clear frame.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward: Aria decorates, the gauge activates, she experiences a vision, then returns with a renewed sense of purpose. Causality is legible enough (gauge → light → vision) and orientation is clear, but the narrative reads as a mostly static, accumulative meditation with one predictable swell rather than a shaped arc. Closure is present as a mild resonant reconfiguration—she feels “peace and clarity”—yet the before/after line is conceptually neat more than dramatically charged. Little on-page cost accompanies the shift, keeping the structure from feeling truly consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: discover film → glimpse past → find diaries → reinterpret estate → accept role in legacy. This works under an accumulative/lyric lens, but almost all beats are told in summary rather than dramatized scenes, so turns feel muted. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (the cartographer’s stance toward the estate and legacy shifts), though the cost of this shift is faint. There are no major causality breaks, but escalation is extremely soft.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: painting + humming + mirrors stirring → mirrors revealing futures → painter’s quiet success. That sequence is coherent, but there is no true on-page test or complication—each move simply works as stated, so the “breakthrough” feels preordained. Closure does occur (she has succeeded; her relationship to the mirrors is reconfigured), yet the cost of reaching that point is gestured at (“for years, she had been working”) rather than dramatized. Structural repetition—restating her motive and the mirrors’ secrets—substitutes for a tighter, more eventful arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Elian prepares, conducts, and then reflects on negotiations on the terrace. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, but negotiations and any turning points are summarized instead of dramatized, so there’s little felt causality beyond “he worked hard, therefore peace progressed.” Closure exists as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise image—Elian resting with the clipboard after a hopeful breakthrough. However, decisive changes in options or knowledge are told in broad strokes, with minimal on-page testing of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: manufactured drought → decision to restore → use of map → release of waters → transformed landscape, which yields a clear Decisive Change. However, the plan unfolds without friction or complication; once we are told she has a plan, the outcome feels inevitable. The mechanism of “releasing the waters” is handwaved at the key turning point, which softens the sense of earned resolution. Closure is present but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is simple but coherent: she arrives seeking solace, engages in a ritual act (untangling threads), the prism responds, and she departs changed. Causality is intact in a symbolic register—the untangling leads to echoes, which trigger the prism’s glow and her shift in perception. However, the pressure on that sequence is low; nothing resists or complicates her progress, and the “cost” of change is mostly implied nostalgia. Closure does land—she walks away into a “new era”—but with minimal sense of an alternative path meaningfully foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece is well oriented early: we know who Amaranth is, where she is (the radar dome), and what she’s doing. Structurally it’s a single, continuous scene whose beats mostly reiterate her mission and the dome’s calming effect; causality is simple and linear. Closure is present but mild: she leaves with an intention to return and a renewed commitment to her project, but there’s no decisive turn or real price. Overall it reads as a meditation more than a developed narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent accumulative arc: Aria arrives, works, completes a ritual, and departs with renewed purpose, and the closure beat (the glowing wing, the lingering presence) lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is light but intact—each move grows out of the previous one, and there’s a legible before/after in her stance toward her task. However, the sense of cost or narrowing options is faint; nothing on the page forces her to act now or abandon an alternative path. Structurally this is publishable-adjacent but too low-tension for the target tier.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is straightforward: she arrives with a goal, performs a ritualized technical process, and the culminating sound confirms success, providing closure. Causality is coherent and there are no orientation problems; the accumulative, process-focused lens is consistent. However, the sequence is nearly frictionless—each step works as intended, with no complicating turn or meaningful cost beyond effort. The ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration (she has “done it”) but without much sense that the outcome was ever in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is clean: bunker → seal/message → dream descent → post-storm realization, with a coherent causal throughline for an accumulative/textural piece. Closure qualifies as a quiet conceptual repricing—Hindsight reframes their relation to “paths” and the seal’s meaning. However, the stakes stay low and obstacles are nearly absent; nothing meaningfully resists Hindsight’s inquiry. The “decaying directive” thread never reaches a concrete test or consequence, so the ending feels intellectually tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural progression from discovery to decoding to covenant, with a recognizable before/after in the astronomer’s felt unity with the universe. Causality is soft but legible: they decipher the tile, sense a liminal historical moment, then use the tile to seal a covenant. Closure exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration (life’s work complete, self merged with celestial rhythms), but the cost of this shift is barely articulated. The structure is essentially one long, uniform scene without a decisive tightening or complication, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: sanctuary → melody returns → reality bends → Elara acts → the world changes. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary becomes a beacon and the world outside slowly reflects its harmony, but the cost of this shift is minimal and largely asserted. Much of the piece is expository reflection on philosophy rather than dramatized beats, so cause-and-effect feels soft and accumulative rather than sharply motivated. The final “legacy” paragraphs edge toward summary, diluting the immediacy of the central scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: find sextant → use it in mirror-making ritual → complete mirror → cross into glass-mountain realm. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the pressure builds texturally toward the boundary erasure and portal crossing, which gives a clear before/after. However, causality is fairly soft; obstacles never emerge, and the sextant’s “key” role is more asserted than dramatized. Closure is present but low-cost and somewhat preordained, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, but it leans heavily on summary (“as the days passed,” “visitors began to notice”) instead of dramatized turns. The causal chain (breach → Elara tends orchard → forgotten seeds → revitalized cathedral → Aria’s return) is coherent but sketched at a high altitude, with key shifts (e.g., why Aria returns now) handled by convenient ellipsis. Closure exists—Elara’s solitary tending becomes shared caretaking and public pilgrimage—but the decisive moments are narrated rather than experienced. Cost is more implied than concretely felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: walk → humming → robed order → bathroom → revelation → book → new resolve. Structure is linear and clean, with one main escalation (entering the grove/bathroom) and a conceptual closure when the curator reprices knowledge as nonlinear. However, the stakes and cost of engaging with forbidden knowledge remain abstract, so the closure feels low-pressure. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural and holds, but the final change is more stated than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is easy to follow—message → bookstore search → ally with time traveler → outwit pursuers → find diary → find library—with no major logic breaks. However, most key beats are told in summary (“a series of rescue missions,” “by researching gaps…they were able to stay ahead”) rather than dramatized, which flattens escalation. Closure exists via Elara’s repriced goal (knowledge to applied purpose), but the victory over the pursuers and the library’s discovery come with very little on-page resistance or cost. Structural cleanliness is serviceable but not yet at a publishable level of dramatic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent—ship → book → card → stories → Garden—but reads more as a guided tour than a pressured sequence. The inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural, yet the escalation (fog thickening, ship “alive”) doesn’t meaningfully change Lyra’s options or extract a price. Closure lands conceptually (Garden as place/state of mind), but the victory is almost frictionless. No major reversal or decisive tightening occurs; each step simply delivers the next clue.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward: arrival, ritual, revelation, and a brief aftermath; causality is loose but coherent enough. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural, with atmosphere and repeated motifs building toward a conceptual repricing of the “fables of absence.” Closure is present—Emilia leaves altered in outlook—but the path there is frictionless, with minimal on-page cost or genuine complication.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and clear: noise → analysis with the stone and ice → resonance shift → hush. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does build toward a reconfiguration where the caves become peaceful and the beings attune. However, there is almost no real obstruction or cost; the process from problem to solution feels frictionless. Closure is present but not especially charged or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: discover prism → gain shard → journey inward → touch orrery → light returns. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece does build toward a brighter, more resonant final image, so closure is present as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. However, causality is thin and largely untested—nothing seriously resists or complicates the custodian’s goal, and the shard simply works. The collapse of civilization raises theoretical stakes, but the on-page sequence feels almost frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: observatory → forecourt → memory immersion → re-emergence with a clarified role, which functions as a soft resonant reconfiguration. The causal chain is thin but legible—she descends, touches the crystal, receives memories, and reframes her identity. However, there is no significant turn or complication; the same mood and intention carry from start to finish with little narrowing of options or escalation of cost. Closure exists but feels low-pressure and almost foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is a straightforward accumulative walk: gardens → performers → mosaic note → renewed inspiration, with clean orientation and a legible before/after. Closure lands as a small resonant reconfiguration when she reads the note and reinterprets the night as nurturing rather than oppressive. Cost is minimal and the progression is linear and low-pressure; the beats are more observational than causally tightened. Nothing major breaks, but it feels slight for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, but the structural movement is minimal: she watches a pause, reflects, then the pause ends, with no decisive change in options or cost. The closure beat (dawn, rising, peace) is a gentle cadence rather than a charged reconfiguration, so the before/after line is faint. Causality is clean and orientation solid, but the story feels more like a sustained mood paragraph than a scene with a meaningful turn. The global drive never tightens enough to make the final image feel necessary rather than simply stopping point.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and clear: hour approaches → inversion and hush → internal experience → hour ends with a new stance. Causality is straightforward (father brings Eli for therapeutic exposure; the gilded hush experience produces a shift), and there is a clean sense of before/after. However, most turns are soft and expository, with limited dramatized beats of decision or resistance; the experience largely “washes over” Eli. Closure is a modest resonant reconfiguration, but the cost and necessity of this particular path could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative/textural arc: she traverses the terrace, attends to sound and silence, and ends in a slightly deepened hush. Causality is loose but not broken; events proceed in a calm sequence with no confusing jumps. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration—she finishes her day feeling she has advanced her mission—yet the before/after shift and its cost are faint. The repetition of similar beats (“as she drifted… as she glided… as she worked…”) dilutes structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: waterfall → orchard → ruby flake → murals → cryptic phrase → revealed stairs → throne, and the closure (she claims the throne) is legible. However, the path is almost entirely frictionless; nothing meaningfully resists or complicates her progress. The “until sunrise” clock barely affects tactics, and there’s no real sense that she might fail or pay a serious price. Closure is present but not strongly earned in terms of cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal spine (threshold fading → reconnect with shadows via scars → journey inward → rekindle central flame → threshold restored → choice to reengage with the world) is clean and easy to follow. Closure is present and legible as a decisive change with a mild cost (abandoning isolation) but the path is frictionless: every step works on first try, with no meaningful complication or doubt. Structure is essentially linear and stable, but the middle reads like a smooth summary rather than escalating scene. This is a solid functional arc, not yet structurally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a causal chain from texts → volunteering → lab anomalies → diamond event. However, much of it reads as summary (“she threw herself into the work…”) rather than dramatized beats, and escalation is more told than felt. Closure exists—Lyra fulfills the quantum promise and leaves changed—but there is no meaningful on-page cost or complication testing this arc. Several intriguing set-ups (parallel dimensions, the bolt) never pay off causally, only decoratively.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and legible: reading → crank activation → visions → understanding → departure, which supports an accumulative/textural drive. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing: the protagonist leaves with a “newfound understanding” that will end a dynasty. However, causality is mostly declarative—events happen because the text says so, not because concrete pressures force particular choices. Cost at the end is conceptual rather than dramatized, so the before/after divide lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a straightforward accumulative structure: find program → murmur allegiance → unsnap token → energies coalesce → manifestation → merger. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration: the knight is altered by merging with the “shape of possibility” and gains a new stance toward the world. However, most beats feel like linear restatements of “energies gather and reality shifts,” with little narrowing of options or complication; causality is present but soft. Cost at the ending is implied but not truly felt, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent, moving from discovery of the box/button to a redefined sense of purpose, but the beats are largely descriptive rather than causally pressured. The drive lens is accumulative/textural: details about objects and “unknown histories” mount until the room is reconceived as a sanctuary. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, yet there is little sense of a risked or lost alternative path. The absence of real obstacles or reversals keeps the plot from feeling fully shaped for a high-level venue.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Aria moves from hiding to lagoon to clandestine gathering to quiet dispersal, with a clear before/after. Causality is intact but light—nothing meaningfully resists her path, and most tension is declared rather than enacted. Closure functions as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn finds her connected to others and recommitted, but the cost remains abstract. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural rather than truly causal in how it builds.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative/textural arc: she enters, plays, the mist responds, the prophecy is tacitly countered, peace settles, then a cyclical return of mist. Causality is loose but legible—music soothes fear—and orientation is clear early. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (the grotto feels safer; the prophecy “hushed”), but the cost is barely felt and almost nothing truly changes for the protagonist. The middle largely reiterates the same beat rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is simple but coherent: she notices the speck, prods it, builds a monument, the glow reveals a pattern, she decodes a prophecy, and is transformed. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the accumulative, lyric drive is consistent. Closure exists (she emerges with new purpose and understanding), but the “great change and transformation” remains abstract, with minimal sense of what could have gone wrong or what was truly at stake. The prophecy’s impact on her future options is gestured at rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and linear: workshop → discovery of compass → greenhouse improvisation → return with device → realization and departure. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it does build toward a conceptual repricing of coincidence and uncertainty, so closure exists. However, almost nothing resists him: there’s no concrete obstacle or test of the device or his new stance, so the before/after hinge feels low-cost. The compass-guided building sequence is the only real development, and it doesn’t quite tighten options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: retreat after failure, contemplation, recommitment, and a quietly affirming ending. However, most developments (new experiment, months of work, “unexpected results”) are summarized rather than dramatized, so beats blur together. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes her past and finds a new internal stance—but the cost of that shift remains vague. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern holds, but the lack of concrete turning points limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal line is straightforward: she enters the gorge, senses a soul (light/harp), approaches, listens, guides, and moves on. There is a clear closure unit—helping this soul find peace and reaffirming her ongoing task—but the turning points feel soft, with no serious doubt or alternative path. Reflection and theme statements in the last third slightly flatten the structural tension instead of tightening it. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern is coherent but the final reconfiguration is modest in impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    The causal throughline—waking post-rescue, deciding to go to the forest, undergoing a trial, returning changed—is legible and coherent. However, the middle “trial” in the forest is heavily summarized, so the crucial transformation beat (reaching the clearing and grasping the “mathematics of mercy”) lands as a quick tell rather than dramatized struggle. Obstacles are soft: the restraints and Arin’s objection dissolve quickly, and the forest offers no concrete resistance beyond heightened light. Closure exists (she returns with memories and a new stance) but the cost remains conceptually more than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: market → lens purchase → discovery in painting → internal reorientation → departure with new purpose. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, it does progress toward a reweighted final stance, but escalation is mild and largely interior. Closure lands as a quiet decision/charged poise rather than a decisive change, with cost only faintly implied. There are no major causality breaks, but the journey feels more like extended setup than a fully pressurized narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a simple causal chain—Ezra enters, notices the barrel, analyzes dust, discovers a compartment, finds the logbook, and leaves with a reweighted perspective—so structurally it’s coherent. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration: she exits with the barrel and a renewed sense of purpose. However, the middle sags into repetitive atmospheric restatement, and the ghosts never meaningfully alter options or outcomes. The cost of what she learns is gestured at but remains conceptually soft rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: find bottle → release whisper → embark on frost-printing project → achieve the eternal moment, with closure landing as a resonant reconfiguration of reality rather than a decisive choice. Causality is soft but coherent, and orientation is clear from early on. However, stakes and costs remain abstract, and the rupture’s supposed danger (“destabilize perfect systems”) never manifests as a concrete dilemma or loss. The ending offers conceptual closure but not a strong sense of before/after consequence beyond diffuse “ripples.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure follows a mostly linear accumulative mode: find shard → reflect → work in lab → closure on her new identity. Causality is soft—beats are linked more by reflection than by concrete turns, and the “storm” and “time made visible” never force a decisive choice. Closure does land as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts herself as chronicler, not fighter), but the cost is more implied than dramatized. Orientation is clear from early on; the weakness is limited escalation and a lot of summary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean and linear: he works, tension accumulates toward the “moment of truth,” and the box finally plays, providing a clear closure beat. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of description and mythic exposition coheres, and the glowing chip/resonance chamber return at the end with some reweighting. However, the conflict’s stakes are mostly asserted in abstract terms, and there is no genuine risk that the repair might fail or cost him something. As a result, the before/after change is more conceptual than felt, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural progression: she arrives, feels drawn, follows the compass, enters the grotto, deciphers symbols, and “becomes one” with the lagoon. Orientation is clear and the throughline (compass leading her deeper) is coherent. Closure exists as a Conceptual Repricing—she reaches “the place where explanations fail”—but the cost of that shift is not meaningfully dramatized. The result is structurally tidy but low-pressure, with escalation more declared than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece has a clean single-scene structure: arrival, discovery of the slide, reflective working process, finished sculpture, and walk-away realization. Causality is soft but coherent—GPS failure → arrival at archway → discovery of slide → sculpture and insight—and there is a legible before/after in her understanding of hidden patterns. However, the closure lacks a concrete cost and remains primarily conceptual and affirmative. Under an accumulative/textural lens this is serviceable but not yet competitive for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is accumulative and lyric, but the progression “as the days passed / as the last snow melted” largely repeats the same beat of contemplation and gradual insight. There is closure—Luna arrives at a new understanding of interconnectedness and finds peace—but the causality is soft and low-cost. The cathedral visits and postcard reflections form a coherent through-line, yet the story avoids a decisive turning moment or crisis that would reconfigure stakes more sharply. Overall, it reads as a smooth meditation rather than a shaped narrative with one strong tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Structure is linear and easy to follow (Naomi moves through the zeppelin library, meets Ada, talks, resolves to keep searching), but causality is thin and many key beats are summarized rather than dramatized. The diary “has led her” here and the parley “would change the course of her journey,” yet those links are told, not shown, and no concrete obstacle turns on what’s learned. Closure functions as a soft reaffirmation of her quest, with no decisive change in options or knowledge beyond vague “beginning to understand.” The accumulative, reverie-like mode is coherent, but lacks a charged, costly reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is essentially accumulative/lyric: a static scene of contemplation that slowly intensifies in rhetoric until the dawn turn, where the alchemist “began to work” and the town “began to transform.” This does provide a rudimentary Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the before/after is legible—but without specific steps, obstacles, or consequences, the transformation feels abstract. The amber bottle and brightening lanterns recur but never decisively alter options. Causality is more implied mood-shift than dramatized change, which is publishable-adjacent but not yet at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative scene: scribe enters, archives emotions, an unintended prophecy is set in motion, and they depart leaving the charged object behind. Causality is soft but legible—recording → shifting patterns → sense of prophecy—and orientation (who/where/when) is clear from early on. Closure exists in the charged poise of the final image, with the dawn-lit garden “waiting for the prophecy to unfold.” However, the cost and concrete consequences of the prophecy remain vague, keeping the structure from feeling truly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and clear: she finds the cap, opens the vortex, experiences visions, and arrives at a realization about inheritance and duty. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens, and closure lands as an internal reconfiguration (accepting her lifelong task as guardian). However, the cost of that acceptance is mostly told rather than dramatized, and the middle swells with similar-feeling mystical description without a sharp structural tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a single POV and clear physical anchors in the sanctuary and cathedral. Causality is mostly “and then” rather than “therefore”: Ember notices, experiments, discovers, and transitions into a new role without a decisive, pressured turn. Closure is present—a stable reconfiguration where she embraces the bell and listening as her calling—but the cost is only implied and lightly sketched. Overall it functions, but the lack of a strong hinge moment keeps it out of high-literary territory.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric structure: one night of sweeping, reflection, and a quiet dawn exit. Causality is simple but coherent, with the yellow lantern and the stars as repeating anchors, and there is a modest closure beat when the janitor leaves with a reframed sense of purpose. However, there’s no visible cost or meaningful narrowing of options; the before/after distinction is conceptual but low-stakes. The reflection-heavy middle doesn’t introduce new pressures—just reiterates the same insights.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is straightforward: a single continuous scene that moves from approach → opening → reading → closing the box, ending in a quiet earned stasis with the recluse accepting the burden of memory. Causality is simple but coherent, and orientation is clear from early on (who/where/rough when). However, the “tangled covenant” that supposedly caused the world’s downfall remains almost entirely off-stage, so the large-scale stakes never integrate with the on-page action. Closure lands, but with modest cost and relatively low narrative complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative structure, but the beats are largely iterative: notice capsule, send messages, get hint, decode, understand more. Closure is a mild conceptual repricing—time is reframed as a new pattern—but the before/after divide and cost are faint. The “garage sale messages → hidden pattern → repairing capsule” line is coherent but low-tension and heavily told. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, but escalation and payoff remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural vignette: feather → poem → kite snap → walking away, with a quiet resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but coherent, and who/where/when are clear early. Closure exists—a conceptual repricing of her experience and connection to the world—but the “cost” is minimal and nothing on the page significantly constrains options. The structure is smooth but low in narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens, but functions mostly as a retrospective summary rather than discrete beats that build pressure. Causality is clear enough—diagnosis → urgency → remodeling → haven → decline—but nearly all turns are told in overview (“As the weeks turned into months…”) rather than dramatized. Closure is an Earned Stasis/RR variant (the caretaker dies, the orchard endures), but the cost is more stated than felt. Lack of on-page scene work at the climax limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: threshold → path → entrance → encounter → realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the walk and repeated atmospheric beats build toward a conceptual closure about homecoming, but there’s minimal sense of options narrowing or problems complicating. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing—the journey reframed as self-discovery—but cost is extremely soft and largely asserted. Several set-ups (first contact, “artificial pilgrimage”) never pay off in concrete situational terms, leaving the arc feeling thin.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow—he travels, stops, plants, leaves—but reads more like a ritual description than a plotted scene. There is no significant turn or complication; nothing resists him, forces adaptation, or reframes the situation. Closure is technically present (the battlefield-to-garden promise) but arrives without a decisive change in options or knowledge, largely restating what was anticipated from the start. The accumulative lyric lens is coherent, yet very flat in terms of narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: find orb → revelation → solve riddle via phonograph cylinder → travel → discover spring. Orientation is clean from the opening (post-war scrapyard in Krael, Lyra and Kael’s roles established). Closure functions as a quiet Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: they locate the spring and reframe the wasteland as a place where beauty and life can return. However, the journey is summarized as “long and arduous” without concrete obstacles or costs, so structural pressure never meaningfully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Aria in a shut-down deck → sees an anomalous light → sketches → aligns it with the compass → decides to move toward it. Closure exists as a modest resonant reconfiguration: the deck shifts from stagnation-symbol to catalyst as she commits to forward motion. However, causality is soft—her choice feels more like a natural next mood than a pressured decision with consequences—and the “time dilation” premise never affects options or rules on the page. The accumulative, meditative drive lens is coherent but underpowered for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal spine is straightforward and legible: sky is wrong → mission assigned → spire infiltrated → chess pieces swapped → sky restored. Structure is linear single-POV and orients cleanly, and there is a clear Decisive Change at closure (the sky’s restoration and Moonwhisper’s upgraded status). However, there are no obstacles, reversals, or complications; every step unfolds as planned, so tension flattens into a procedural summary. The lack of visible cost at or after the climax limits the sense of consequential closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and legible: a quiet tableau, an intruding historian, alliance, and a final reconfiguration around the chessboard. Causality is soft but present (“figure appears” → “message” → “alliance” → “walked words” → “new understanding”). Closure functions as a conceptual repricing when the survivor re-sees the missing pawns as opportunity, but the cost of this shift is vague. The accumulative/lyric drive is consistent, though the lack of concrete consequence keeps the plot from feeling tight.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and clear: search → discovery → vision → act → transformed threshold, with no orientation issues. Causality is serviceable but thin; the stone’s vision leads almost immediately to a sweeping metaphysical action without intermediate pressure or complications. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (the bookstore becomes a gateway) but the cost of this change is more implied than concretely felt. The drive reads as mostly accumulative/textural, and under that lens the cadence shift at the end is adequate but not striking.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain—decoding the tapestry, discovering the labyrinth, entering it, emerging changed—is clear and easy to follow. Structurally, though, the middle (labyrinth) is compressed into abstract summary, so we skip over the concrete tests that would make his transformation feel paid for. Closure lands as a decisive change in self-regard, but there’s minimal on-page cost beyond remembered guilt. The piece reads more like a parable of an internal shift than a fully dramatized arc under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: we move from establishing the canyon/studio, to rising ritual-urgency, to a climactic poetry outpouring, to a vision of the spire, to a reflective resolution. Under an accumulative/textural lens, there is a clear closure beat—a conceptual repricing in which the “price of forgiveness” becomes something to be understood, not paid. However, the causal chain is soft and largely mystical (her line is spoken, the mist parts, revelation arrives) with little sense of constraint or consequence beyond a serene acceptance. The ritual’s looming presence is underused structurally, remaining more atmospheric than a true narrative clock.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward: she works on the statue under time/physical pressure, finishes the pattern, surfaces, and reflects, giving a basic causal spine. Closure exists—she completes the mapping and moves from compulsion to a quieter acceptance—but the cost is mild and the “statue as universal map” revelation remains conceptually vague. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what she’s doing), but the breath-holding frame strains plausibility given the length and density of reflection between gasps, dulling the urgency the structure claims. The drive lens reads primarily accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal, with escalation more implied than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear with one clean backstory insertion (the cracked mirror), and the drive reads as accumulative/textural: scenes of painting and discovery build toward a legacy-oriented closure. Causality is generally intact—mirror → caves → oasis → painting → legacy—but many beats feel like linked vignettes rather than escalating turns. Closure is present via a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts her work as her enduring presence, though the cost (her eventual absence) remains conceptual rather than felt in-scene. The “wrong turn” discovery arrives a bit conveniently and without prior structural pressure, softening its impact as a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a simple accumulative structure: garden → memory of vial → beckoning ritual → inner shift, with clean temporal and spatial anchors. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian ends with a new sense of purpose and belonging to a “vast and intricate web,” but the before/after difference is modest and low-cost. Causality is soft—events feel more like a mood progression than a chain of narrowing options—and nothing truly forces or complicates his course. Still, it reads as one coherent scene with a legible endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and coherent: signal station → mysterious calls and map-building → journey → arrival at the plain and acceptance, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated mentions of calls, maps, and the censer gradually build toward the “reverse migration” being complete. However, many key beats (the peril of the journey, what the calls demand) are summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation and causal texture feel thin. Closure lands cleanly as an internal stance shift with legible cost (letting go of the past, accepting incompleteness).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and legible: find glass eye → discover relic connection → decode tree messages → uncover hidden cache → read cures → reframe self and world. This causal spine exists but plays out almost entirely as told summary, so beats land more like outline points than pressured turns. Closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise when they leave resolved to balance rationality and feeling, but the cost of that stance is only lightly implied. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, just under-dramatized for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece functions as a single, clear scene with accumulative, textural drive: observation → speculation about the lighthouse’s legend → charged closing image. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael takes the boutonnière and implicitly commits to pursuing the mystery further. However, causal stakes are soft: the “investigation” produces little concrete change in options or knowledge, and much is reiterated (“Kael knew he would have to investigate further”) rather than structurally turning the situation. The lighthouse-as-memory mechanism is asserted but never tested in scene, which dampens the sense of decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain—chip → symbols → ants → cavern → map → doorway → father’s note → hidden chamber—is coherent and easy to follow. Closure exists: she fulfills the lingering promise and reaches a new stasis with a renewed sense of purpose. However, many key beats (especially “series of trials” and decisions with the map) are summarized instead of shown, reducing the felt cost and impact of the structural turns. The drive lens reads as causal with a light accumulative texture, but escalation and choice are underdeveloped in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: gaze from cobalt grotto → climb to ridge → enter ember grotto → reach its heart and confront an unspecified truth. However, almost every beat is a similar “she feels drawn/deeper” intensifier, so escalation blurs into repetition. Closure exists in form (she goes from standing outside to having crossed a threshold and “found a truth”), but the truth and its cost are withheld, muting impact. The causal chain holds, yet the ending reads more like a promise of story to come than a fully satisfying short-form unit.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative lyric meditation: she studies the shell, hears the whispered line about “density of presence,” pursues a revaluation, and reaches a quiet conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is simple but intact, and the closure—her sense that she has unlocked the shell’s meaning and deepened her connection to the world—is legible. However, the middle heavily reiterates her process of examination without a strong structural turn or sharpening of consequences. The ending cadence is clear but low-impact for a venue demanding maximal narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: cabin → writing → immersion in dreamscapes → rereading → reframed peace. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and it does reach a Resonant Reconfiguration where nostalgia shifts from pain to catalyst. However, the inciting incident of seeing the grave is mentioned once then dropped, and there is little sense of progressive complication—many beats reiterate “I wrote and felt X” without new consequences. Closure exists but cost is soft and the path there feels more like gentle drift than an earned contour.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions as an accumulative, lyric meditation: she enters the shop in fog, reflects on loss and method, handles the screw, and leaves with a renewed sense of purpose. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration—her loss reframed as compatible with her vocation—but the cost of that stance is muted on the page. Causality is minimal but coherent: each perception justifies the next reflection without temporal or spatial confusion. Still, there is no decisive structural turn or sharp narrowing of options; it’s a gentle arc rather than a compellingly shaped story.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece is structurally coherent as a single, continuous scene: arrive to meditate → breath/whispers → intense writing → sunset and drift into darkness. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaito emerges having “captured a fragment of the divine” and lightened his past, with the storms parting as an external echo. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens. The cost of this shift is mostly implied rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps the piece out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal spine is simple and legible: Lyra goes to the archive to send a magical apology, finds the bottle, performs the ritual, and leaves feeling changed. The piece achieves closure via a quiet emotional shift (hope/peace after sending the message), but the orchard thread remains largely parallel rather than structurally integrated. There is no serious complication or reversal—once the bottle appears, everything proceeds smoothly to success. Overall structure is coherent but feels schematic and low-pressure for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a clean, linear arc from reading in the library to walking out and then returning, with the “hiccup” in the universe as a loose structural hinge. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of walking inward/outward and growing silence does build toward a quiet closure. However, the decisive transformation—cosmic balance restored—happens entirely at the level of assertion, with no clear on-page turn where options or knowledge fundamentally shift. Closure exists conceptually, but the cost and causal inflection are thin.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece works as an accumulative, lyric sketch rather than a causal plot: the shepherd watches, winds a clock, reflects, and returns to watching. There is a nominal closure beat—the recommitment to watchfulness and “counting backwards” as dawn comes—but the before/after distinction is subtle and low-cost. Much of the middle loops the same idea (duty, fascination with time) without sharpening it into a decisive change. Structure is coherent and linear, yet the closure’s reconfiguration of stakes remains conceptual and undercharged.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a simple enter–contemplate–leave arc with an accumulative, lyric drive, but the sequence of beats is largely flat: noticing mushrooms, musing on strangers, affirming a coming breakthrough. Closure exists as a Conceptual Repricing—Lena now “knows” she has begun to understand—but the before/after hinge is mostly rhetorical, not dramatized. Causality is coherent but almost trivial; very little in the middle forces a different stance at the end. The story reads more as a scenic essay than a structured narrative with a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.0)
    The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: library → subway rides → graffiti → new conceptual frame → resolve to design a program. This does land a form of closure (Conceptual Repricing) as Elara reframes her father’s addiction and commits to an approach. However, virtually all the movement is interior summary; there’s no concrete scene where an insight is tested or a live option foreclosed, so cost is faint. The structural shift from study to traversal back to the library is clear, but the turns feel more like restated intention than escalating beats.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is essentially a static lyric meditation with a light accumulative curve: operator → pattern of wrong numbers → chosen role in the loop. Causality is thin but coherent, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the loop is embraced as meaning rather than tedium. However, there is no real on-page cost or decisive change beyond the narrator’s abstract framing of what they “have done” and “will continue to do.” The piece feels more like a concept sketch than a fully dramatized narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear with a late zoom-out into future summary, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the start. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds a mood more than a chain of because/therefore turns, and the rediscovery “years later” functions as a mild resonant reconfiguration. However, there is no meaningful on-page turning point; the archivist starts and ends in essentially the same stance, and the legacy/rediscovery section is told rather than dramatized. Closure exists but carries little sense of paid price or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Raven arrives with a plan, rumor chains spread, the station transforms, Raven departs changed. Causality is serviceable—Raven seeds rumors, people respond, atmosphere shifts—but almost all beats are summarized rather than staged, which keeps turns soft. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: Raven’s belief about loneliness is reweighted and their options going forward are conceptually different. The cost, though, is faint; no concrete sacrifice or risk sharpens the change.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a straightforward accumulative journey toward a single destination, and the causal chain—hear melody, follow to stillpoint, receive realization—is clear. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration at the stillpoint, but the cost of arrival is barely felt, making the before/after divide conceptually rather than dramatically weighted. There are no real obstacles or reversals, so the middle offers little structural tightening. Nonetheless, the piece holds its lens and completes its promised arc without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: mistake with the seeds → deeper pondering of the pen → decision to unbend/reactivate it → beginning to write with a new understanding. The story delivers a quiet closure: Aria moves from uncertainty and regret to active authorship within the anomaly, a clear before/after. However, most turning points are declared rather than dramatized, and the stakes stay small and largely internal. The gravitational anomaly’s response registers as atmosphere rather than a pressure that meaningfully alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene in the harbor that builds toward a charged, quiet ending where the harbor feels “tuned” and the advisor departs. Causality is simple but coherent—advisor notices camera, receives story, transforms it into music, crowd gathers, night ends. Closure exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is muted: we sense poignancy rather than a legible before/after that significantly narrows options or deepens stakes. Structural repetition of similar beats (noticing, understanding, orchestrating) flattens what could be a sharper rise and final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear beginning (entering the archive), middle (creating the art trail), and end (discovering the message and leaving). The piece leans heavily on summary—“as the days passed,” “with each new piece”—so we skim over what could be pivotal beats instead of inhabiting them. Closure exists in the form of a resonant reconfiguration when the art trail leads to the message, but the cost and consequences of this are only faintly implied. Causality is intact, but the key turns are under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece functions under an accumulative/textural lens: Aria drums, the lagoon responds, connection intensifies to a shared vision, then ebbs into a calmer after-state. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the moment reweights her relationship to the shared dream and her role in it—but the cost (the fragility and fading of memories) remains conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete turn. Structure is linear and clean, but pressure barely shifts; beats feel like variations on one emotional note rather than a tightening sequence. Still, the through-line from treatment → drumming → vision → quiet acceptance is coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a legible before/after: she sets herself a challenge and reaches a moment that nominally proves her thesis. However, the causal chain is weak: she wanders, happens on clue-like objects, and then conveniently encounters a stranger who immediately provides the needed whisper. Closure functions as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks felt cost or a sharp turn. The geomagnetic storm, maps, and key do not yet intersect meaningfully with the central test.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative, single-scene encounter: figure arrives, pattern is woven, tension dissipates into a final calm. Causality is thin but intact—each step follows the last, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where “stillwater tension” eases into serenity. However, there is little sense of options narrowing or stakes shifting in a meaningful way, and several paragraphs rephrase the same emotional state. The closure has image-level cadence but minimal felt cost or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: library → call (unspoken words) → grotto → plan → town’s transformation → return. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure (town reconfigured into a contemplative space) functions as a resonant reconfiguration, but the path there is frictionless. Major turns are summarized rather than dramatized, especially the implementation and reception of the window displays. Cost and constraint at the ending are only lightly implied, so the before/after is conceptually clear but not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is clean and linear: dock work → whale call → plunge → revelation → return, with a clear before/after in her stance. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing (realizing the island is a state of being), but the causal chain is relatively soft, with many beats feeling like lyrical restatements rather than escalations. Stakes and options don’t materially narrow; once the call arrives, her path seems inevitable and untested. The cost of the decision at the end remains abstract, slightly flattening the power of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, lyrical vignette rather than a causal arc, and that structure is coherent and legible. The bouquet’s arrival and Echo’s increasing fixation provide a faint sense of progression, but there’s no decisive turn where options narrow or stakes shift. Closure is a quiet conceptual repricing—the final stillness and “remade hush” reweight Echo’s rituals with a hint of hope and cost. However, because so much is summarized and static, the before/after distinction feels intellectual more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent and oriented: we always know where we are and what she’s doing. However, the piece largely traces one continuous state of reverent inspiration, with no distinct structural turn beyond a general intensifying of language. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—she leaves “forever changed”—but the before/after lacks a concrete hinge scene or clear cost. This makes the piece feel more like a single extended mood than a fully structured story.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative vignette rather than a structured scene, with events linked by “as days passed” rather than meaningful turns. The discovery of the concertina reed tongue is positioned as an inciting moment but never really forces a decision or reorders options. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (the courtyard now celebrates imperfection), but the cost of this change is absent or negligible. Overall causality is intact but shallow, with summary progression instead of a shaped arc.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric rather than causal, and that’s coherent, but structurally it’s almost entirely flat: discover lamp → wander lab → feel more connection. There is a faint Resonant Reconfiguration in the closing satisfaction and the lens becoming a symbol, yet there’s no discernible cost or decisive change. The meta line “to meet the word count, we will stop here and conclude” undercuts closure and breaks the fictional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: retreat → ritual/origami → curtains illuminate → renewed purpose. However, the causal chain is mostly asserted (“it was said that…”, “as the stars aligned…”) rather than dramatized through obstacles or tangible consequences. Closure exists as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the character’s stance toward their craft and life changes—but the turn is gentle and low-cost. The accumulative, lyric drive is coherent, yet the beat sequence feels static and somewhat repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent: she works through the night, reflects, finishes, and leaves at dawn. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, but the accumulation is relatively flat—each paragraph reiterates the same activity and intention with minor variation. Closure exists as an Earned Stasis: she remains on her path, symbolized by the measuring tape and her return to the crowd, but the before/after difference is minimal and cost is barely implied (a long night’s work). No orientation or causality breaks, but the arc is soft for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward and legible: archive research → arrival of pagoda → visionary experience → aftermath, and it closes with a clear before/after shift in understanding. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the escalation into vision and then into written synthesis reads coherent. However, the “forbidden” aspect never materially complicates events, and there’s no meaningful cost or consequence to the transformation beyond a declared inner change. The result feels more like a polished vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: reading, reviewing footage, recognizing the shadow, then resolving to act. Orientation is clear and the progression from observation to realization to decision is coherent. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing/charged poise—she newly understands the shadow and chooses to share—but the cost of this choice is only lightly implied, not felt. The piece reads more like a poised vignette than a fully pressurized narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, single-scene lyric, with the chameleon encounter and the night’s work slowly reorienting Lena’s self-understanding. Causality is minimal but coherent; each paragraph restates and slightly reframes her reflection without breaking orientation. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: by the final image she has conceptually recommitted to her work with a fresh lens. The cost of this shift—what she’s losing or forgoing—remains vague, softening the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation is solid early: who, where, and the mission are clear, and the story maintains a single continuous descent. The structure is largely linear (“as they descended… as they worked… as the hours passed…”), functioning more as a mood-piece than a tight causal escalation. Closure does land—a before/after around breaching the chamber and sensing the “stories in the scars”—but the cost and decisive change are muted and mostly conceptual, with little concrete consequence or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and legible: film strip → vision of letters → realization → return to the booth, with a conceptual closure as the gazer reframes goodbye letters as enduring love. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece layers atmosphere but offers only a single, soft turn when the letters “take on a life of their own” and reveal stories. Causality is simple but intact, yet there’s little sense of options narrowing or of the experience creating new constraints on the protagonist. The ending’s cost is muted, more comfort than reconfiguration with bite.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single ritual night framed by an implied long pattern “across an unwritten calendar,” closing with a renewed sense of purpose—an on-page but low-cost Decisive Change. The drive is accumulative/textural: repetition of star-gazing, adjustment of the astrolabe, and listening to whispers slowly reweight her inner state. Causality is thin but coherent (ritual → deepening connection → internal shift), and there are no orientation issues, yet the lack of specific obstacles or tests keeps the arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: walk → encounter clock → charm/archive activation → merger with dune → dawn separation, forming a coherent before/after arc. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Asa becomes part of the dune and then resumes her journey with the archive “safe” and sparks nurtured. However, escalation is gentle; nothing meaningfully threatens failure, and every step works on the first try. Causality is intact but low-pressure, which keeps this out of a higher band for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens: wandering → deepening trance → expanded consciousness → return. Closure exists as a soft resonant reconfiguration—he now sees the rainforest as a “gateway”—but there is little sense of cost and no meaningful turn in options. The middle and ending recycle the same motions (walking, listening, translocating) with slightly louder language rather than new consequences. Structure is coherent but thin for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: walk → vigil → renewed resolve → arrival at shore. However, the journey is largely frictionless; “treacherous waters” and “dangers that lurked” are asserted but never dramatized or made to force tactical changes. Closure is a Charged Poise moment—reaching the glimmering shore and threshold of testing—but cost is only implied, not felt. The result is a soft but legible arc with limited dramatic reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece functions as a single accumulative scene: watchkeeping → brief intrusion by the figure → return to contemplation with a shifted stance. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of silence, but the causal chain is thin; the bench-tightening moment only lightly motivates the shift. Orientation is clear and consistent. The cost of the bellhop’s stance is implied rather than concretely tested, which softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow—Kael researches, leaves messages, waits, confronts—but most turns are told in summary (“As the days turned into weeks…”) rather than played in scene. The central causal chain (messages lure pretender; words powered by rune expose them) is coherent, but almost all the “investigation” and danger are asserted off-stage. Closure exists—pretender revealed, mission accomplished, Kael departs—but the decisive change lands conceptually more than viscerally. The lack of dramatized obstacles or reversals keeps the plot from feeling like a fully earned arc.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: it accrues images (station, drum, atlas, paths) rather than moving through sharp causal turns. Orientation is solid from the opening and the narrative moves coherently from observation to inquiry to a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: Maya shifts from seeking an answer in missing maps to accepting the sea’s rhythms as the primary “truth,” with the torn page recast as an emblem of irreducible mystery. Cost and consequence, however, remain mostly conceptual and gentle, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal line—spaceport → dissatisfaction → legend → journey → stone circle → renewed purpose → return—is coherent and easy to follow. The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, with experience at the stone circle reconfiguring her stance, and closure (renewed direction) is clearly on the page. However, the path is very smooth: there are no real obstacles, reversals, or complications between intent and fulfillment, so the change lands without much felt cost. Structural repetition of motifs substitutes for sharper turns, which keeps it below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: search → kite → decoding → retrieval → unsealing, with no orientation issues. However, nearly every step is frictionless; the “slow and painstaking” decoding is summarized rather than dramatized and yields exactly what she needs without setback. Closure is present (she acquires and opens the embryo) but the path there lacks reversals, surprises, or meaningful narrowing of options. Structure reads more as a ritual sequence than a plot with consequential turns.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a straightforward walk-to-cliff-and-reflect sequence with a clear before/after: she arrives anxious and leaves calmer, which gives the piece basic resonant closure (RR under an accumulative lens). Causality is minimal but coherent: environment → bodily calm → reframing of her grief. The main weakness is that cost and difficulty are underplayed; the turn toward healing feels relatively frictionless, with no concrete obstacle or reversal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: broken box → meditative untangling → revised perception and renewed purpose. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it maintains a consistent drive, but there is only one soft “turn,” when she realizes the fragments are intertwined, and the felt cost of that insight is minimal. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing—darkness refigured as beginning, library as sanctuary—but the before/after divide is gentle rather than striking. Some late-paragraph repetition of the same realization blurs the sense of a single, crystallizing ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Kael tracks faint ink traces, follows the drone’s cue, and finds the missing person, leading to an epiphanic moment. However, the dominant drive (to understand why time slows in crisis) is not strongly dramatized in the moment-to-moment action and mostly arrives as exposition. Closure is a soft conceptual repricing—time and patterns reweighted—but with little felt cost or narrowed options. Structure is clean but under-pressured for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal line is clean: find pod → read letter → decide to disseminate → watch repercussions, with no orientation issues. Closure is present as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: Aria adopts a new role as guardian of contraband truths and the world’s narrative shifts. However, most turns are summarized rather than dramatized, and the cost of the change remains mostly conceptual and off-stage. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, held consistently but without a strong final price point.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative vignette with almost no causal progression: Aria tends roses, we’re given backstory, then she goes to sleep unchanged in stance or options. The “tower’s collapse” and ruined city never translate into an on-page turning point or concrete pressure. Closure aims at Earned Stasis (she has chosen the oasis over the sword), but that decision is entirely off-stage and never recontested, so the ending lacks a clear before/after shift with cost. Structure is coherent but feels static and essayistic rather than story-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: enter garden → search → perform ritual → receive echo → depart. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the text builds atmosphere but offers only a soft escalation—no decisive turn in options or knowledge beyond “she finally hears the echo.” Closure exists as a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (she’s renewed and will return), but the before/after line is faint and low-cost. Repetitions (“as the night wore on,” recurring legend restatements) underline stasis rather than progression.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain—journalist’s call → fear for the empire → observatory reflection → decision to investigate via “proof by contradiction”—is straightforward and legible. Structure is essentially one reflective scene with a clear before/after stance, so closure as a charged decision exists, though lightly. Still, the scandal, investigation, and potential fallout all remain off-page, so the decisive change has little concrete cost or consequence. The “proof by contradiction” frame is announced but never dramatically exercised, which blunts structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: atmosphere and motifs (sounds, firmware, letters, guilt) layer toward a quiet reconfiguration. Causality is soft but coherent—haunted firmware plus time-folding pressure leads to the tether, which stabilizes her and enables reinterpretation and release. Closure is present (she emerges lighter, the lab no longer haunted), but the cost is muted and the healing feels somewhat easy, hinging on realization and ritual more than hard-won change. Some set-ups (baby-cry translation, time folding) never fully pay off structurally, which blunts the sense of tightly designed progression.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single continuous scene with a clear accumulative drive: working on the mandala deepens her internal process, the whispers and mist crescendo, and the final alteration yields a quiet resolution. Causality is soft but coherent—tile → “listen deeply” → heightened attunement → final change to the mandala → new stance. However, many beats feel like lateral restatements of the same state rather than distinct turns, so escalation is more repetitive than shaped. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (greater peace and readiness), but the before/after distinction is conceptually gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative structure: discovery of the tessera → vision of the past → decision to rename the plaza. Closure is present via a Conceptual Repricing of the space, but the cost of this act remains abstract and unpressured. Causality is legible, yet the beats feel more like a thematic meditation than a series of consequential turns. As a result, the arc is coherent but soft for elite short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Echo finds the coin, weaves echoes, repairs the fractured timeline, attains peace. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with the garden and echoes thickening toward a closure where her presence dissolves into the setting. Causality is more implied than dramatized—“the coin is a key,” “she weaves echoes, so the garden shifts”—but remains coherent enough, if a bit schematic. Closure does land (she succeeds and rests), yet the cost is muted and the timeline stakes never become concrete beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a largely accumulative, textural structure: Luna meditates, experiences images, then creates art, culminating in a dawn-lit moment of pride and hope. Closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but the before/after shift (blocked by telepathy pill recall vs. new geode-guided method) is underplayed and largely told. Causality between beats is loose “and then” progression rather than pressured turns; almost nothing Luna does could plausibly fail or meaningfully change her options. The telepathy pill recall and risks are introduced but never developed into live structural constraints in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: awakening, exploration, mapping, culminating in a luminous cavern and a quiet affirmation of purpose. However, the beats are largely iterative—she walks, senses, maps, feels wonder—without a decisive structural turn or complication. Closure is more a restatement and gentle intensification of the opening premise than a reconfiguration with cost. Under a textural lens it functions, but at a relatively low-tension plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric meditation more than a shaped progression: the turner notices the jar, catalogs buttons, realizes a thematic truth. Causality is thin—beats could largely be rearranged without altering impact—and escalation is mostly repetition of “unraveling truth/shared wisdom” in slightly different phrasing. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (prophecy reframed, warehouse as crucible), but the before/after is mild and almost costless. Orientation (who/where) is clear and stable, so the weakness lies in structural flatness, not confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and readable: arrive at bluff → search snow → follow revealed path → meet double → return changed. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the walk into and out of the mist does form a before/after, but escalation is minimal and everything unfolds without resistance. The closure (reconciliation with another self) is on the page yet cost is only lightly implied, with no difficult turn needed to achieve it. Causality holds but feels outline-simple rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is a single, continuous, well-oriented scene that reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens: waiting, crossing, arrival, and disembarkation. However, the “palimpsest promise” and long wait never face a concrete on-page test, so the closure—fog lifting, mutual understanding—lacks visible cost. The final reconfiguration is gentle and legible but not powerful enough for high-tier literary closure. Causality is intact; the limitation is muted consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clear: Akira arrives, contemplates, attunes to the glass and place, reaches an insight, and departs. Causality is soft but coherent, with each step plausibly flowing from the previous perception or sensation. Closure is present—a conceptual repricing about why places resist change—but the cost of this realization is barely felt. The piece risks monotony because no beat significantly reconfigures options or tightens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: the rose drops its last petal, the gardener prunes and reflects, dawn arrives with a renewed purpose. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it maintains a steady pattern, and there is a modest resonant reconfiguration at the end (gardener as quiet guardian). However, the middle lacks a genuine tightening or meaningful shift; many sentences reiterate the same beat (“bring light into darkness,” “hidden corners”). Closure exists but with minimal sense of before/after cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: one long scene of Lyra working with the sundial while thinking, with no real causal turns beyond time passing and light shifting. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—she feels more at peace and ready to “forge a new path”—but the cost is mostly implied and low-intensity. Structural repetition (“In this quiet…”, “In the days to come…”) blurs beats rather than sharpening them, so progression feels circular. The reincarnation memory frames her mood but doesn’t create a problem that the scene then resolves in a legible before/after way.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: temple appears, Lena reflects, artists arrive, she contributes, then realizes something about connection. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does land a quiet closure with her conceptual shift and peace. However, the causal chain is soft—beats feel like adjacent tableaux rather than pressured turns, and the final insight doesn’t carry a strong sense of cost or irreversible before/after. Still, there is a legible arc from solitary pondering to communal art-making.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain is simple and legible: disturbances → Lyra studies signals → sends counter-signal → disturbances fade. However, there is no real complication or reversal—no failed attempt, no unexpected consequence—so the structure feels outline-like rather than dramatically shaped. Closure exists (the tricksters’ influence wanes and Lyra embraces vigilance), but comes without visible sacrifice. The drive lens reads as Causal, but with minimal tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Lyra explores → hears organ → follows it → unlocks door → touches crystal → experiences spatial “mutiny” and insight → returns changed. The structure is linear, easy to follow, and there is a clear closure beat where the nature of the “vital key” is redefined (Conceptual Repricing). Cost is present but mild—mostly wistfulness at leaving and a reorientation of understanding rather than a sharp loss. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with a light lyric overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: one sitting in the quarry, talk about cases, painting progresses, quiet realization at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of mist, portrait, and ribbon builds toward a conceptual repricing of “cold cases” as emotional rather than evidentiary. However, there is minimal on-page complication or choice; most turns are rhetorical rather than situational. Closure lands conceptually but at low cost, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece is structurally coherent—one night in a weather station—and causality is never confusing, but the story reads as a static situation rather than a developed arc. Beats are summarized (“with each new discovery…”) instead of dramatized, so we don’t feel the research changing her options step by step. The ending gestures at a coming revelation (“would change her life forever”) without putting a decisive change, resonant poise, or explicit conceptual repricing on the page. Closure lands as an open promise rather than a felt before/after shift under any clear drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is essentially linear and clear: arrive at overlook → encounter objects/signs → have a realization → depart with new resolve. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the fiddler reframes their past secrecy and embraces storytelling, but the cost is only vaguely implied. The “pixelated amnesty” and hitchhiker backstory are told rather than worked into any on-page turning point or concrete test. There is one main cadence shift (before/after the music), but escalation is conceptual rather than driven by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: exploring the train → associative memories of the startup and father → conceptual resolution about journeys and stories. Causality is soft but legible—present stimuli prompt reflection—but there is no strong tightening or hinge moment that reconfigures options. Closure exists as a quiet conceptual repricing (the value of the journey and his intent to share his story), yet the before/after is modest and mostly declared. The structure is competent but not yet at a level of charged inevitability or high-stakes change.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens, tracking one contemplative night to dawn with a modest Resonant Reconfiguration as Lyra feels renewed. Causality is minimal: the telegram prompts reflection, the inscriptions “begin to reveal their secrets,” and then she feels lighter, but no concrete beat forces a turn or introduces cost. Structure is linear and easy to follow, but key developments (breakthrough in research, impact of shared burdens) are summarized rather than dramatized. Closure exists but lands gently and without much narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrival at the vortex, discovery of the frozen figure, release, mirror revelation, then a forward-looking exit beat. Causality is present but soft—events mostly unfold without resistance, and the “because/therefore” links feel more like “and then,” especially around the ice shattering and the mirror cracking on cue. Closure exists as a conceptual shift (“what mirrors don’t show” reframed as soul-vision), but the before/after remains abstract and low-cost. The frozen figure and mirror pay off the setup adequately, though in a summarized, low-tension way.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: Aria encounters the maze, moves through it, reaches the nexus tree, has a vision, and exits with a new conceptual understanding. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression to the ancient tree and revelation about the “eclipsed covenant” provides a workable Conceptual Repricing closure. However, causality is soft and low-stakes—the maze yields rather than resists, and there’s no genuine risk that might derail her goal. The cost of her discovery is not made legible, so the before/after line, while present, is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and clear: arrive → find card → weave spell → depart changed, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens there is a modest escalation of ritual intensity, but the promised premise of “bartered destinies” never actually manifests in on-page terms (no explicit trade, no visible counterpart destiny), so the core causal promise is underused. Closure exists—she leaves lighter, with a reweighted relationship to the card—but the decisive “barter” is more told than enacted and carries little felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal spine—quiet in the quarry office, a phone call about an amp, reflection, then a decision to re-engage with appraising—is coherent and linear. Closure lands as a modest resonant reconfiguration: Jack reinterprets silence and decides to pursue a new approach to his work. However, the inciting “disaster” and the phone call’s specific content are underdeveloped, so escalation is more declared than structurally felt. The before/after is legible but the cost and narrowing of options remain conceptually soft.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens but offers almost no structural tightening: Elara reflects, the seed glows more, and then she has essentially solved the problem. The ostensible drive—reestablishing the connection between realms—is declared rather than dramatized, and its “achievement” is summarized (“she had allowed her to succeed”) without on-page test or reversal. Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing (everything is connected; relationships matter more than components) but carries no discernible cost or narrowed options. As a result, the before/after difference is conceptually legible yet dramatically weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens, but even by that standard the structural arc is flat: we move from description of role and space to a restatement of the same in slightly different language. Closure is a mild resonant reconfiguration—“preserving wonder in routine” crystallizes as the librarian’s stable stance—but there’s little sense of a before/after shift beyond rephrasing. No concrete constraint tightens options, and “after tomorrow disappears” never pressures tactics. The ending image is coherent, just not strongly earned by progression.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric build: discover pearl → feel stored emotions → hear seashell confessions → internal realization. Causality is soft but coherent, and orientation (who/where/what) is clear throughout. However, closure lacks a palpable cost: Aria’s decision to carry the pearl’s meaning out into the world is asserted as transformation without any credible on-page trade-off or narrowing of options, which blunts the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens: one continuous scene of contemplation at the station building toward a quieter sense of peace. Closure is a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—she feels lighter and chooses to keep walking, with the station refigured from abandonment to rebirth. However, structurally little actually happens; many sentences restate the same ideas about maps, journeys, and forgiveness without new consequences. There is no real on-page turn beyond a shift in mood, which limits narrative impact at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is essentially linear and accumulative: the dreamer searches, discovers the book and watch, documents patterns, then crosses a threshold and reinterprets the quest. Causality is loose but present enough under a textural lens—each step gestures toward the next, with the doorway appearing after the “final entries” are transcribed. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing (the library as a state of being), but the cost of this shift is underdeveloped. Repetition of similar beats (walking, sensing, writing, realizing) slightly flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: quiet scene → coffee-reading ritual → internal weighing → resolve, with a stable lens and a modest Charged Poise closure. Causality is soft but intact—coffee stains prompt reflection, which leads to a decision—but key stakes (the empire, the promise losing its glow) never receive concrete tests or consequences. The before/after is legible (contemplation to commitment), yet the cost of that shift stays hypothetical. For an elite venue, the lack of a sharper inflection point or concretized price keeps this in the “promising sketch” range.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions on an accumulative/lyric drive: Aria works on the emerald, attunes, infuses it, and experiences a reconfiguration of her relationship to death. The causal chain is simple but coherent, and closure is present in her felt shift from imminent crossing to a poised readiness “whenever it might come.” However, escalation is gentle and the “threshold of stillness” never creates a real structural crisis; the outcome is never in doubt. Reflection and repetition slightly blur a sense of progression versus circling the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a mostly linear, accumulative structure: tending plants → noticing the hairpin → reflection on rebirth → realization of the hairpin’s symbolic meaning. Closure exists as a conceptual shift when Aria identifies the hairpin with the eternal cycle and feels she has found contentment. However, the beats are highly repetitive, with near-identical sentiments restated, and there is no strong structural tightening or complication beyond that reflection loop. The drive lens (accumulative/textural interior meditation) is coherent but produces a low-tension, low-cost arc.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrival, diagnosis via wind chimes, metaphorical “unhooking,” and departure, with a legible before/after in the client’s relationship to certainty. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the piece does land a mild resonant reconfiguration via the final image of the shard and the lighthouse. However, most turns are told rather than dramatized, so the mission feels relatively frictionless and low-cost. Closure exists but lacks a sharp, felt pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is a single, continuous teaching scene that is easy to follow and closes with the student understanding the lesson. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: repeated images (rings, hush, grotto) and assertions build toward a quiet realization rather than causal turns. Closure technically lands, but without a felt or conceptual cost, the before/after is thin. Many beats restate the same situation, so progression feels incremental rather than shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: the skimmer appraises the arrowhead across centuries, perceives patterns (birds, echoes, dust), and ends with a reweighted stillness and synchronized pulse. That constitutes a modest Resonant Reconfiguration, but the before/after is conceptual rather than dramatized, and the cost of this shift never bites. Structurally, the middle is very repetitive (“as the dust continued to fall,” “remained steadfast”) and lacks a distinct tightening beat; the story feels more like an extended descriptive meditation than a shaped arc. Causality never breaks, but the closure is soft and low-impact for the intended bar.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: exploration → discovery → interaction with keystone → internal shift. Causality is intact but minimal; nothing truly unexpected resists her progress, so beats read more as a guided tour than a pressured sequence. Closure is present—her renewed purpose is a clear before/after—but the cost of that change is only abstractly suggested. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build is serviceable but not especially tight or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and clear: Kael descends, finds the book, explores, and reaches an epiphanic view of the lanterns. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, with atmosphere thickening toward a conceptual shift at the window. Closure is a mild Conceptual Repricing—he reframes luminous vows and the “color of sound”—but it lacks on-page cost or a decisive change in options. Many beats (opening, descent, wandering) are parallel rather than causally tightening, so escalation feels more like prolongation of mood than structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: coins → static analysis → distillation → ingestion → alignment. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it builds toward a closure where the protagonist’s role in the backwards prophecy crystallizes. However, escalation feels mostly like restatement; no decisive complication or genuine threat sharpens the process, so the final alignment reads as inevitable rather than earned. Closure exists conceptually but with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: observatory → atlas → conjured echoes → departure, with one continuous scene. Causality is simple but coherent: finding the recordings led to the current experiment; looking at the atlas page shapes what’s crystallized; the experience reconfigures the reaper’s stance and they leave with a slightly altered peace. Closure is a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—the reaper’s relationship to sacrifice and fear shifts—but stakes and cost stay abstract. Structure is clean, yet the middle drifts toward repetition rather than a truly tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure: mage encounters broken bell, performs ritual, bell is restored and tolls. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of drops and incantations builds toward a soft closure where the bell’s toll signals a before/after. However, there is little real impediment or uncertainty about success, so escalation feels more like time passing than options tightening. Cost at closure is conceptual (devotion and balance) rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is accumulative and lyric rather than causal, with the warden walking and taking photos as the primary throughline. There is a loose sense of closure as their purpose—to create a healing narrative—gets reiterated in the final charged poise of “promise of stories yet to be told,” but there’s no decisive turn or clear before/after. Many sentences loop the same idea (“trail of photographs,” “expunge the pain,” “spin stories into shared meaning”) without changing the situation. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, but the ending feels more like a fade-out than a reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the crystal → decision to use flame → mist affecting starlings → perception of a coded “language” → renewed research and a calmer, resolved stance. Structure is linear, single-POV, and oriented from the outset; the accumulative/textural drive (building atmosphere and insight rather than dramatic reversals) is coherent. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reinterprets her work and her connection to the orchard with new confidence. The missing piece is felt cost—nothing in the world or in her options is lost, so the before/after divide is intellectually clear but emotionally low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural vignette: Lyra revises data and her device through the night until dawn, at which point she has new findings. Orientation is clear (who/where/when), but the “mission-changing” discovery is summarized rather than dramatized, so the structural payoff feels generic. Closure exists—a quiet earned stasis/charged poise as night becomes day and her work is “complete for now”—yet the cost and concrete change in options remain abstract. Many sentences reiterate the same state (working, burden, trust) without distinct turns, so progression is more looped than shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive: one meditative scene with slowly intensifying reflection that resolves in an internal reconfiguration. There is closure—Kaito emerges with a new stance toward his identity and the brain in the jar—but the path there is structurally flat, with no clear tightening turn or complication in the middle. References to history rewriting itself and reality warping never factor into actual options or consequences, so they don’t add structural pressure. The result is coherent but low-tension, more essayistic than dramatically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.6)
    Structure is linear and legible: she receives the seed, reflects through the night, then begins designing a new room at dawn. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural—pressure is more atmospheric than causal—yet the piece still offers a modest closure where the seed is reinterpreted as catalyst. However, stakes remain low and no decisive turn with a palpable price occurs; the “mystery” never complicates her options or forces a hard choice. As a result, closure reads more like a gentle mood cadence than a charged reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: he enters the tunnel, plays, summons memories, and achieves restoration. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure is present in the shift from oppressive silence to gentler silence and tentative laughter. However, causality is soft: nothing meaningfully resists him, and many paragraphs reiterate the same beat of “haunting melody awakening memories.” The hourglass line (“its final grain slipping through... after the final grain slips”) is both redundant and syntactically broken, undercutting structural polish.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: patrol → waiting → mist-presence → reverie → reconfiguration of her stance. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens (the more she opens to the mist, the more knowledge and peace accrue), and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing) is on the page. However, the middle feels like a plateau of similar beats rather than a clear tightening, and the cost of the transition into reverie is only lightly implied. Structural sophistication is adequate but not at a top-tier, publish-ready level.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is a straightforward, single-scene build from preparation to ritual to result, with a clean before/after (broken crozier vs. new creation, bound destiny vs. new path). Causality is intact—gathering fragments and channeling energy leads to transformation—but the middle is texturally repetitive rather than structurally escalating. Closure qualifies as a Decisive Change, yet the price of that change is only faintly implied, not dramatized. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural, and while the cadence shift at the end lands, it does so with modest impact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a simple linear arc—arrive, attune, discover message, experience realization, depart—under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is broadly intact but soft: the shard leads to listening, which leads to a chamber and a message, yet these links feel convenient rather than pressured. Closure is a mild resonant reconfiguration (she now sees decay as beautiful and ongoing), but there is little sense of an altered field of options or tangible price. The structure risks monotony because each beat delivers similar interior commentary without a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation is clear early: we know who Elara is, where she is, and what oddity (the vanishing ferry) haunts her route. Structure is essentially linear: post-shift cleanup → grotto exploration → discovery of markings → decision to step through a metaphysical threshold. The closure unit is a Charged Poise moment—Elara stepping into the unknown—but the cost and concrete consequences of that step are vague. The drive lens reads mostly accumulative/textural with light causal linkage, but escalation in options and constraints is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is circular: she enters, wanders, experiences intensifying visuals, then returns to the entrance changed in understanding. As an accumulative/textural piece, the cause-effect chain is soft but legible enough, and the closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration—she now carries the thread into the world. However, the middle section loops similar beats (“ever-shifting landscape,” “erupt into color,” “memories alter”) without adding new stakes or constraints. The lack of a clear cost or decisive turn keeps the closure from landing with real force.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, reflective vignette with a loose causal through-line (Lyra walks, teaches, reflects) rather than a structured story with a decisive turn. The discovery of aliens and the lesson on starlight navigation are declared pivotal but never dramatized into a concrete, pressured choice or consequence. Closure rests on a told assertion that the city and students are transformed, without an on-page cost or before/after beat that makes that shift felt. Structure is clear but dramatically underpowered.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is simple and legible: hearing aid pulses → Aria follows → encounter with the sister → reassurance → partial emotional resolution. The piece functions more as an accumulative, single-scene vignette than a story with a strong turn; the “decisive change” is modest (the woman gains some closure, Aria resumes her work). There are no overt breaks in logic or time, but the scene unfolds linearly without a meaningful structural surprise. Closure exists but feels soft, with the final paragraphs reiterating rather than deepening the key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clean: enter facility → find logbook → understand cables/phase transitions → retrieve codex → escape via cables. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the closure (surfacing with the codex, inwardly altered) is legible as a completion of the initial mission. However, key turns (finding the codex, using the phase transitions) arrive without impediment, and no obstacle meaningfully threatens failure. The result is coherent but outline-like, with low felt cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: arrive in observatory, engage the ink-divination process, perceive the ghost, reach a reframed understanding, and release the shard. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds atmosphere and symbolic density more than eventful turns, but there is still a legible before/after in Akira’s stance. Closure lands via conceptual repricing: the ghost’s purpose shifts from mystery to source of wisdom, and the shard’s fall seals that change. Stakes and costs stay mostly abstract, so the structural arc feels elegant but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece works as an accumulative/lyric structure, building from observation of the birds to the creation of a new language, and closure does land via conceptual repricing (curse→catalyst, old language→new). However, the progression feels more like restated premise than developed sequence; many sentences reiterate the same relationship between birds, patterns, echoes, and translation. The “before/after” is legible but soft, with minimal sense of what options have truly changed. Structurally coherent, but not yet tight or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Lena enters the garden, receives the arrowhead, uses the phone, undergoes a perceptual change, and emerges with a new resolve. This works under an accumulative/textural lens, but escalation is soft and largely internal, with no concrete obstacles or reversals. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—she reframes the mystery and her own darkness—but the cost is only vaguely implied. Phrases like “the timeframe was still reeling from the aftermath of the missing return changed” feel important yet under-explained, weakening causal and world-rule clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Luna plays → statues soften and crack → they become human → she decides to continue her journey. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear before/after and a closure beat where the orchard is transformed and Luna moves on. However, there is no on-page obstacle, setback, or alternative path; events unfold as a smooth enactment of the premise. The ending’s “cost” is minimal and conceptual, so while closure exists, it doesn’t land with much force.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clear: receive package → approach border → time movement with drone distraction → deliver and return. Closure exists in his successful delivery and renewed sense of purpose, but there is no visible cost or reversal—nothing he loses or risks in a felt way on the page. The structure is essentially linear exposition plus one brief scene. The drive lens reads as Causal but the escalation and payoff are underpowered for the stakes declared.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal spine (working → hearing the song → following it through the mist → oasis encounter → return to work with new meaning) is clean and easy to follow. The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens and lands a modest conceptual reweighting at the end. However, beats feel more like linked tableaux than escalating tests; nothing threatens or meaningfully complicates the quest. Closure is present but soft, with little sense of irreversibility or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: we move through one extended process of tending the library and mapping hyperbolic spaces until a soft reconfiguration at the end. Causality is minimal but coherent: she works, the stories stir, she finishes, the stories are “reawakened.” Closure exists, but the before/after shift is modest and largely declarative: there’s little sense anything might not have worked, or that options materially changed. Structure is linear and readable, yet dramatically thin for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story functions as an accumulative lyric sketch of a daily ritual rather than a plotted arc, and within that mode the structure is coherent and easy to follow. However, there is minimal development beyond reiterating the same pattern: dawn, photographing, painting, returning to the library, seeking codes in images. Closure is a soft resonance—Elian “continued to paint with light”—that slightly crystallizes purpose but doesn’t mark a decisive before/after or visible cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, yet the final cadence feels more like a loop than a reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent causal line: star appears → locksmith follows it → finds tree and hair → unlocks it → idea unfurls. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—the world and locksmith are “a little bit more open to possibility”—but the cost of this act is vague. Structure is linear and clean, with no orientation issues, yet the lack of real constraint or consequence keeps the arc from feeling fully earned. The accumulative, lyric lens is consistent but never tightens into a truly pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a clean, linear structure: search → discovery of the mushroom → star-gazing → vow to pursue her stolen memories. Causality is gentle but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with the mushroom find and sky observations layering toward resolve. Closure is present—she commits to a journey—but almost all meaningful consequences are deferred off-page into the future. This keeps the scene feeling like a prologue rather than a self-sufficient story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene with a clear throughline: the archivist annotates the shadow, deepens understanding, and reaches a small but legible closure in having “unlocked the secrets” and taken a “first step” toward reversing exile. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural—intensifying description and insight rather than discrete causal turns—and this holds consistently. However, escalation is gentle and the cost of success is almost entirely absent, so the before/after line, while present, feels conceptually mild. Orientation is clean and the ending does deliver a recognizable Resonant Reconfiguration, just not a deeply pressured one.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Aria arrives, plants the heirloom seed, works magic, transforms the world, departs. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, with description layering toward a soft closure where the world is more wondrous and Aria leaves a legacy. However, there is little causal pressure or genuine obstacle—everything goes exactly as intended, so the before/after shift lacks cost. Closure exists but feels conceptually tidy rather than narratively earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: she unknots the net, releases spirits, absorbs the silence, and departs. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does close on a resonant reconfiguration—the sanctuary and silence reweighted after the ritual—but the cost and turning point are soft. There is effectively one long beat of labor rather than distinct turns, and the “stakes” of success never feel in doubt. Still, the before/after (spirits bound vs. released) is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one scene of investigation that gradually accumulates significance. The drive lens is essentially accumulative/textural: looking, comparing footage, listening, then arriving at a reweighted understanding of the henge. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—she now experiences the henge and the “map” of her life differently—but the lack of any real on-page price or narrowed options keeps the plot from feeling fully shaped or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure—a single underwater exploration accumulating reflections—holds together cleanly and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “letting go” as reframing. Causality is modest but coherent: objects (snow globe, logbook, net) cue shifts in thought that culminate in the ascent and altered perspective. The “last transmission” twist (from past to own mind) is graceful but low-stakes, with only a soft emotional price. Overall it functions, but escalation and cost remain gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is a single, linear, accumulative scene: she notices the object, creates messages, the storm builds, the mural completes, and the entity responds. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she moves from seeking contact to feeling a deepened connection and self-understanding. However, causality is soft; many beats feel like restatements of the same idea (encoding/communion) rather than distinct turns, and the cost of the change is barely legible. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural and remains coherent, but the escalation and payoff lack sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent structure—elevator ascent, corridor walk, chamber discovery, descent—without orientation problems. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural, culminating in Elara’s reconfigured view of the spire and herself, which qualifies as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration. However, causality is extremely soft: nothing meaningfully threatens or complicates her reading of the diary, and there is no tangible cost attached to her realization. The result is more a mood piece than a fully shaped story, which undercuts publishable-level closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous, reflection-led scene tracking from storm aftermath to a quiet epiphany at the telescope, which gives a modest Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Causality is light but consistent: storm → reflection/communication → telescope → clarified sense of purpose. However, the piece leans heavily on summary and affirmation, with few discrete beats of change or choice, so the before/after shift is more stated than dramatically felt. Orientation is clear and the accumulative/textural drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: working → discovery of the safe → decoding the coin → painting under demolition’s shadow → departure. Causality is modest but intact under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing where the artist accepts carrying only a fragment of the infinite out of a doomed space. The demolition frame and the coin both return at the end, giving a clear before/after in meaning and circumstance. The main limitation is that turns are soft—no beat demands a difficult choice, so escalation is more tonal than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal through-line is coherent: find luminance → infer code via hopscotch board → decode message → chart map → resolve to pursue discovery. Structure is basically one continuous scene with a clear beginning and end, and orientation is never in doubt. However, the drive is largely accumulative and textural with almost no genuine turn or complication, and closure is soft: Eli is “ready” but no decisive choice with cost lands on the page. The result reads more like an opening chapter than a self-contained story with full closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: library → text → clues → door → hall → realization, with no orientation issues. Structurally it’s a straightforward quest with one continuous escalation from study to discovery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Kael reframes their craft as part of a larger cosmic machinery, but this shift lacks on-page cost. The absence of reversals or complications keeps the structure competent but not compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a straightforward causal arc—Aria conceives a plan, communicates it, settlers implement it, world transforms—with clear orientation and no temporal confusion. However, most beats are summarized rather than dramatized, so turns in knowledge or options are told, not felt. Closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world and community reconfigured by the energy network), but the cost of that shift is never made legible. The drive lens reads as largely Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation is more ideological than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a single, coherent scene: adjuster at work during dusk, culminating in the lullaby, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of “hush,” clockwork, and fragility builds toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. However, the cost of the work—emotional, existential, or otherwise—remains gestured at rather than dramatized, so the before/after distinction is conceptual more than felt. Structure is clean but slight for a venue requiring sharper closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: nut → memory of blueprint → search → marking stones → birds respond → labyrinth reactivates, with a clear before/after and on-page closure. The structure is linear, single-POV, and easy to follow, with no orientation issues and a legible dominant drive. The main weakness is how conveniently problems resolve—no significant setback or complication once she finds the blueprint—so escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent structure: arrival at the ravine → reflection and observation → scientific analogy → emotional reframing → departure with new purpose. Under an accumulative lens, the repeated motifs (foam, chrysalis, braided ravine) build toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but legible: natural patterns prompt the scientific idea, which in turn frames her grief differently. The main weakness is the lack of on-page cost or concrete test of this new stance; the closure is conceptually neat rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is a single, accumulative scene that moves cleanly from lull to contemplation to realization, with no orientation issues. Under a textural lens, the beats (discover bottle → consider incising → choose analysis → epiphany about the library) link logically, but pressure remains very mild. Closure is a conceptual repricing—redefining where “stories begin” and Ember’s relation to the library—yet the before/after cost is soft and largely asserted. The piece holds together, but it doesn’t achieve the tight, inevitable-feeling cadence elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: fortress → dunes/tidal pool → pavilion → return. Causality holds at a basic level (her gift and fixation on remorse motivate the journey), and closure lands via her altered relationship to the stored remorse. However, the escalation feels smooth and untroubled; the “tide of remorse that threatened to overwhelm her” resolves almost instantly without a concrete price. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal, which limits the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece reads as a single, accumulative nocturnal scene framed by night-to-dawn, but the “conversation” with the grain elevator is almost entirely summarized. There is a nominal arc from intent to apparent success, yet no concrete turn or obstacle clarifies how or why the town transforms. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn and hope—without an earned on-page cost or clear decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is essentially a single accumulative scene: arrive, study mirror, restore mirror, receive memories, feel changed. As an accumulative/textural piece it holds together, and there is a recognizable closure beat when she assumes the role of guardian of dreams. However, much of the plot is summarized rather than enacted, with repeated statements of what she “knew” and “believed” instead of distinct turning beats. The cost of her entanglement with the memories remains abstract, muting the sense of a clear before/after with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: manuscript → omen of inversion → grotto → discovery → return, with a clean conceptual closure in realizing the “seeds of vigilance” are tangible. Causality is intact but low-pressure—nothing meaningfully obstructs her or forces a tactical change, and the inversion hour never becomes an active constraint. The closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing with mild cost: she leaves with knowledge and “responsibility,” but that cost is only gestured at. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with textural intensification), held consistently, though escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as largely accumulative/textural: the act of discovery, integration of the insulator, and playing the strings gradually alter the grove’s state. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the grove and the silence are reweighted by the end—but stakes and costs remain abstract. The “hedgehog uncurled” backstory is intriguing yet under-integrated, functioning more as lore than structural pressure. Overall causality is coherent, but the arc feels more like a smooth meditation than a pressured progression.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric lens: one scene, one POV, mood building toward a quiet stance-shift, and that pattern is legible. There is closure in the sense of a resonant reconfiguration—he reframes exile as purpose and commits to a journey—but the before/after is muted and low-cost. Causality is mostly “and then he reflects,” with minimal concrete turning point beyond his already-stated vow. Structural coherence is fine, but the arc is shallow for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Elara notices the diary, unlocks it via frequencies, reads, and has an internal shift. Causality is intact but gentle; each step feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a pressured choice. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she settles into peace and purpose—but the cost of this understanding (especially the ethical breach) is barely acknowledged. The accumulative, lyric drive is coherent, yet the lack of real complication keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: finds rare seed → tends it → bloom releases transformative fragrance → realization and lifelong vocation. The drive feels Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “wisdom” as ever-present rather than discovered. However, escalation is mostly implied anticipation; the turning point (the bloom) arrives without meaningful complication or risk, and the long epilogue summarizes consequences instead of dramatizing a closing beat. Closure is present but quiet and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: countdown, flight, anomaly, discovery, realization, return. Causality holds at a basic level (accelerated growth → trail → pool → understanding), and the closure is a conceptual repricing of what sustains the orchard. However, many beats feel summarized rather than dramatized, and the discovery arrives with little real difficulty or misstep. The cost at closure is minimal (she leaves reluctantly but unchallenged), so the before/after is more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is straightforward: she enters the container labyrinth, surveys, reflects on the crash and the patch, and leaves with renewed resolve; causality is intact and orientation is clear from the start. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with the methodical survey and observations building toward a conceptual closure rather than a decisive event. Closure lands as a quiet conceptual repricing—she reweights the crash as a lesson and the patch as a human tether—but the cost (what this determination actually demands of her) is only lightly implied. The scene lacks a distinct tightening or turn beyond steady reflection, so the before/after line is modest rather than strongly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward: preparation, ritual song, chisel strike, release, and quiet aftermath, with a clean before/after centered on the marble’s hush. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens; each move leads clearly to the next. However, closure lacks visible cost—success is guaranteed from the outset, and nothing threatens failure. The result is pleasant but low-pressure, more ceremonial tableau than story with teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: she travels to the clearing, uncases and plays the flute, enters a liminal experience, then returns altered. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece does reach a soft closure in her resolved intention to return and her new reverence for the flute. However, causality is thin and most beats feel like lateral elaborations on the same mood rather than pressure that meaningfully narrows options or reveals new information. The cost of the journey into “mystical realms” is never articulated beyond a vague sense of transformation, which blunts the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece works on an accumulative/textural drive: it layers Echo’s process, the Halo fragment, and the vanishing stars into a conceptual climax. Causality is simple but intact (Halo fragment integrated → machine prints → Echo reaches a new understanding), and the closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration as Echo departs with purpose. However, the supposed time pressure (“between vanishing stars”) never forces a real turn or visible price. The before/after line exists, but the cost is mostly conceptual and underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is a single accumulative walk along the ridgeway, with the pendant and environment recurring to build mood rather than plot. The only real “turn” is seeing the aurora-woman and then parting, which does not significantly alter Eira’s options beyond a summarised peace afterward. Closure exists as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration—she continues her journey with renewed belonging—but there is no visible cost or narrowed path. Causality is coherent, but the piece reads more like a vignette than a fully shaped story suitable for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads as a single accumulative scene with a clear before/after: from seeking to “she knew that she had uncovered a profound truth.” Under a textural lens, mist clearing and increasing clarity loosely track that shift, so closure exists as a Conceptual Repricing. However, there is almost no sense of jeopardy or real alternative outcomes; events unfold in a straight line without meaningful turns. As a result, the structure feels static and the epiphany low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric arc: she broods, assembles the puzzle, weaves, and then resolves to carry her message. Causality is simple but coherent—puzzle assembly and weaving prompt her renewed determination. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “raveling silence” becomes a bridge, the orchard a threshold. However, beyond that internal reweighting, the plot remains static and low-pressure, with few concrete turns or complications.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward: bargain for silk → forge sword → succeed → apprentice appears → decision to pass on knowledge. Causality is clean but very low-pressure; there are no real setbacks, complications, or choices that reshape options. Closure exists as a quiet reconfiguration (shifting from solitary craft to mentorship and exploration), but the cost of that reorientation is only gestured at, not concretely dramatized. The accumulative, reflective mode is coherent, yet the lack of a sharper turn keeps it mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The causal spine is clear—rumor → shard → activation → multiverse journey → return with new understanding—but most turns are summarized rather than dramatized. The “doorway” phenomenon and the shard’s behavior are set up, yet the crucial revelation is elided (“she knew that she had finally uncovered the secret” without content), weakening closure cost. Structure is straightforward and coherent, but the escalation from rumor to life-changing truth feels more told than shown. Closure lands conceptually (she now sees the multiverse differently) but with minimal on-page pressure leading into it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clear and linear: lamp failure → discovery of sea glass/letters → stone-stacking ritual → quiet resolution. Under an accumulative lens, the repetition of safety/ache/light does form a coherent build toward the final charged image. However, the closure—a decision to “continue to tend the lighthouse” and embrace the ache—carries minimal on-page cost, so the before/after is more tonal than decisively changed. The anonymous letters setup never pays off structurally, leaving a faint sense of an unkept thread.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent: she approaches the lighthouse, performs the ritual, and descends after dawn, with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of light/shadow actions builds toward a quiet closure where the cycle and her duty are affirmed. However, there is essentially no obstacle or complication; nothing tests or alters her course, so escalation is minimal. Closure exists but is low-cost and unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous meditative scene with a clear through-line: contemplate wing → manipulate light → arrive at realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, it does build toward a conceptual repricing (people as iridescent wings), but there is no meaningful turn in options or knowledge until the final paragraph, and even that is softly stated rather than dramatized. Causality is mostly “and then he thinks” rather than pressure-driven “because/therefore.” Closure exists, but with minimal sense of cost or narrowed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is linear and clear: arrive, confront the broken sextant/sorrow, perform the dream-mapping, emerge changed. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it holds its pattern and delivers a recognizable Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, escalation is soft and almost frictionless, with the “task” unfolding without obstacles or surprises, and cost is more asserted than dramatized. Several repeated generalizations (“for in this world…”) flatten causality into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: she explores, encounters the mica window, sings, experiences a vision, and leaves with renewed purpose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the escalation of song, light, and healing forms a legible arc, and the closure offers a mild resonant reconfiguration from despair to hope. However, the dying realm’s peril never concretely pushes back, so the cost and tension of the “rekindling” remain low. The sequence risks feeling inevitable rather than contingent on specific, pressured turns.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: invitation → philosophical curiosity → search → discovery of the book and note → reframing of the mistake → quiet resolution. The accumulative/textural drive holds, and the final realization functions as a Conceptual Repricing that cleanly closes the piece. However, the causal chain is very low-intensity and mostly internal; nothing meaningfully constrains or complicates Elys’s pursuit, so the turns feel gentle rather than pressured. Closure is present but soft, with limited sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: repeated visits to the tea house build to a reflective farewell and a mild revaluation of the bread and place. Causality is soft but coherent—she finds the bread, discovers the tea house, meets the gardener, returns through the season, and departs changed. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the bread and tea house come to signify a key to “deeper understanding,” with a before/after in her stance, though the cost is faint. There are no structural surprises or sharp turns, but no major missteps either.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: Elara examines the slide, samples “frequencies,” discerns a pattern, and arrives at a reconfigured understanding of the vows’ relevance. This yields a modest Conceptual Repricing closure, where the vows shift from relics to a living influence that reframes her role. However, the escalation is faint; the “racing against time” is asserted but never concretely staged with obstacles or narrowing options, and the middle largely reiterates atmosphere and intent. Structure is coherent and oriented, but the central turn feels more told than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Lena searches for the fob, acquires it, then confronts The Shadow until sunrise. Causality is thin but present—her getting the fob and noticing The Shadow’s recognition hints at a link but never pays off in a clear turn or revelation. The “mission to thwart The Shadow” and “capture the sound of trust breaking” remain mostly expository; there is no concrete act of thwarting or specific betrayal dramatized. Closure rests on a mild conceptual reconfiguration (“fragile peace,” “newfound understanding”) that is declared rather than earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and legible: Aria arrives with a goal, the ring activates, she follows it to the “weather-bearer,” touches them, and gains understanding, giving the piece a clear accumulative arc. Causality is soft but present (stories → bluff visit → ring response → encounter → insight), and the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the sense of cost at the end is minimal, and many set-ups (forests’ elections, taste-sensing, people carrying weather) do not meaningfully constrain the final beat. As a result, the ending feels more like a gentle mystical confirmation than a fully earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is straightforward: blocked artist enters cave, engages with symbolic lock, creates art, and emerges unblocked, with a clear before/after. Causality is mostly coherent (handling the lock prompts realization, drawing prompts emotional release, which triggers the lock’s transformation), but the transitions are smooth to the point of low friction, with little sense of risk if she failed. Closure exists as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration—she regains creativity and reinterprets the cave and lock—but the cost is muted and largely asserted. The drive feels more accumulative/textural than sharply causal, and that lens is held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: discovery → map reconstruction → decoding → journey → repository → changed art. Structure is largely expository rather than scened-out, with major beats summarized instead of dramatized, which flattens tension. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Aria’s understanding of truth and connection deepens—but the cost is light and mostly implied. The piece reads as an outline of a novella compressed into a single, smooth arc rather than a fully realized short story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: Aria tunes bells, finds the iceberg fragment, incorporates it, and the bluff becomes a beacon in the post-verbal era. Causality is minimal but coherent; each step is a soft “and then” rather than a pressured “therefore.” Closure exists conceptually (the world tipping into an era where words are unnecessary and Aria’s work being “done”), but the before/after shift comes without an on-page cost. Repetition of ideas and phrases blurs structural beats rather than sharpening a central turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: announcement of the burn, Aria’s choice, execution, and aftermath form a coherent arc. Causal links exist but are soft—her “escape” from programming is more declared than earned through specific obstacles or consequences. The controlled burn proceeds without serious complication, so escalation and payoff feel somewhat preordained. Closure as a quiet internal shift is legible but undercharged.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean and the causal chain is straightforward: mailbox commotion → curiosity → investigation → meeting → locket epiphany. However, almost all the investigation and the meeting with the writer are summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens what should be pivotal beats. Closure exists—a conceptual repricing where Emilia reaffirms “listening heals” and enshrines the locket—but the cost is minimal and the turns feel pre-ordained. The drive lens is causal but underexploited, with no real complications or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is essentially linear and accumulative, but plot causality is soft: encoding the final journal entry appears to magically liberate her without a clear mechanism or external barrier changing. The dominant drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterns of dice, web, and journaling—but even under that lens, escalation is modest. Closure exists (she leaves the lab), yet we never understand what actually kept her trapped or why she can simply "push open the door" now. The before/after line is legible but low-cost and somewhat arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is clear: beached whale → gravity shift → coffee ritual → tunnels → crystal → memory recovery, giving the piece a legible arc with an RR-style closure. However, the path is nearly obstacle-free; each step follows as a gentle “and then” rather than tightening pressure, and the gravity concept never complicates tactics beyond pointing toward the final chamber. The closure is present but cost-light—memories return in a single touch with no visible tradeoff or repercussion. Structurally sound but too smooth for elite-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a clean temporal arc from night to dawn with one POV and an evident ritual structure, which supports a modest but legible closure (the prophecy is hushed, the wing released). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the deepening meditation and thickening silence function as structural beats. However, stakes and opposition stay entirely notional: nothing resists the summoner, no attempt fails, and the “great imbalance” is never concretely tested, which flattens causal tension. The cost of success is largely implied and never dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Structure is linear and easy to follow: rooftop lesson with some backstory, a question that reveals motive, then the gifting of the seal as a closing beat. The drive is largely accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal; beats add atmosphere and explanation rather than narrowing options. Closure exists—student leaves changed, tutor content—but the cost of this change is barely felt and the “quest” remains abstract. Reflection/backstory (sugar → tea sessions) fits within the frame but doesn’t significantly alter present options.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and linear: find shell → listen → memories surface → resolve to move forward, with a legible before/after anchored by dawn and leaving the garden. This provides a genuine, if gentle, closure beat (RR/Decisive Change hybrid) where Lyra’s stance reconfigures. However, most turns are summarized rather than dramatized; the “archiving” and memory unlocking unfold as declarative interior commentary rather than concrete beats. Stakes and causality hold, but the lack of scene-level friction and specificity limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is straightforward accumulative: she undertakes the forgery, completes it, and departs in quiet satisfaction, with no orientation issues. Causality is simple but intact—she works, the narrative gradually reconfigures, she feels she has “unlinked” the original intent and found closure. However, there is almost no genuine complication or turn; the process unfolds smoothly, and the “treason” never concretely threatens her. Closure exists but the before/after shift is more asserted than pressured into being, with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative structure (night of singing → dawn) and delivers a mild resonant reconfiguration when Aria gains conceptual understanding of the echoes and recommits to her quest. However, most “turns” are told as realizations (“through this process, she discovered…”) rather than dramatized changes in options or behavior. Causality is soft—events feel like a series of poetic assertions rather than because/therefore chains—and the cost of her new knowledge remains extremely diffuse. Closure exists but is low-impact for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene: meditation → contact with the snow globe → vision → expanded understanding → exit with renewed purpose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the escalation of images and the final “windows of connection” opening do create a modest Resonant Reconfiguration, though the before/after cost is soft. Causality is intact (touching the globe triggers the vision, deeper understanding triggers her decision to leave), but the turns are gentle and largely expository. Closure exists but is not especially charged or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is a simple, linear nocturnal walk—parapet → garden path → clearing—with an accumulative, textural lens. Causality is minimal but coherent: she follows the moon path, arrives at a secluded spot, and experiences a realization. Closure exists as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (she feels unified with the world), yet there’s no visible cost or narrowed set of options, so the before/after difference is conceptual and airy. The piece reads more like an atmospheric vignette than a fully driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: trail of paper → reconstructed letters → revelation of the stillpoint’s location → journey → discovery. However, much of this is summarized rather than scened, with little sense of obstacles or reversals beyond time passing and weather. The ending functions as a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—Aria steps into a new reality—but the cost of that shift remains abstract. Structurally sound but dramatically under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.4)
    The structure is a pure summary sweep: she senses change, listens to radio, a prophet rises, years pass, a new dawn arrives. There is closure—a before/after where her vision is validated and the world reconfigured—but the decisive turns are all reported, not enacted, and no specific causal beat carries cost. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, yet escalation feels like “and then” rather than pressured narrowing of options. The lack of any concrete scene or micro-turn undercuts the impact of the otherwise coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is essentially a single dawn scene with reflective loops: wake, engage music box, remember jars and mission, then recommit by writing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure does land—the poet shifts from oppressive silence to purposeful creation—but the escalation is mild and largely summarised rather than dramatized. Causality is simple and linear, with no real surprises or complications; the jars and music box trigger reflection but don’t force tough choices. Orientation is clear from the outset, but the lack of a strong tightening limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story reads as an accumulative single scene: walk across ice → enter cabin → tune artifact → walk back, with clear spatial and temporal continuity. However, the plot is almost entirely procedural and internal; the rumored dangers and legends never manifest as concrete complications, so the “mission” never sharpens into an actual test. Closure technically lands in her realization that the artifact is now safe and harmonized, but the before/after is modest and low-cost. The dependence on repeated variations of the same action (attuning, feeling vibrations) instead of distinct turns keeps the structure from feeling fully shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative arc: long preparation → ritual activation → declaration that the revolution has begun. Causality is coherent but soft; nothing on the page tests or complicates her plan, and the “old order” stays off-stage. Closure exists (she enacts the ritual and believes history has turned), but the cost of that turn is not dramatized. Structure is clean yet dramatically thin for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow—enter tunnel, reflect/investigate, emerge changed—so orientation is never in doubt. However, the “investigation” itself is mostly told in retrospect (“had pieced together”) and no concrete turning point in the case occurs on the page, weakening causal drive. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she reinterprets her past and the tunnel), but the decisive change is announced rather than crystallized through a specific act. The drought/rain frame and the inscription are set up but do not materially reconfigure plot options, keeping the piece in a soft, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal throughline—chaplain visits shop seeking a second opinion, encounters clockwork heart and proprietor’s wisdom, leaves with renewed purpose—is clear and linear. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing: he reframes his role from offering solace to helping others “deserve a second chance.” However, there is little on-page cost or genuine dilemma; the turn feels more like an essay conclusion than a pressured story beat. Reflection dominates without significantly altering present options beyond a single, low-friction realization.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric arc: events are summarized over “the evolution of the workshop” rather than dramatized beats, yet there is a recognizable before/after once she grasps the algorithm and rings the bell. Causality is broad but coherent (curiosity → transliteration → understanding → bell), and orientation is clear. However, closure lacks a tangible cost, and many intermediate moves feel like interchangeable restatements rather than distinct turns.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece has a coherent beginning–middle–end spine: investigation → deepening obsession with the numbers → revelation that the files are archived and a reframed purpose. Causality is broadly intact, but key turns (e.g., how she deduces the numbers form a “map,” and how exactly she uncovers the final truth) are skipped over with vague summary (“as Lena finally uncovered the truth”) rather than concrete beats. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing of “deletion” versus “archiving,” with some emotional cost, but it lands softly because the decisive investigative step is elided. The drive lens reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a loose causal thread, handled competently rather than sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: discover fragment → go to lighthouse → use mirrors → reconstitute crystal → walk back with renewed resolve. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the piece does arrive at a closure image (crystal whole, landscape “sighing”), but the decisive change is modest and largely conceptual. Causal links are clean, yet there’s no strong complication or tightening; everything unfolds as expected once the fragment is found. Cost at the end (ongoing burden of guardianship) is implied rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    Orientation is solid early: we know who, where, and when, and the drift-ice marina → relief center frame is coherent. Structurally, the piece follows an accumulative, largely static mode—arrive, volunteer, reflect, end in a slightly reconfigured stance—which works but lacks a strong tightening turn. Closure exists as a quiet reconfiguration (from wanting to die to accepting a fragile peace), yet the cost and decisive “before/after” boundary remain muted and mostly asserted. The causal chain (show up → volunteer → feel different) is linear but emotionally under-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece reads as an accumulative lyric scene: she finds the letter fragment, wanders the vineyard, reaches a reflective stance, and returns to the pavilion. This provides a loose before/after (she clarifies her “task”), but the closure lacks a decisive change or tangible cost—her role at the end is essentially what it was at the beginning. Causality is largely “and-then” reflection rather than events forcing a new configuration. Structure holds, but at a high-literary level it feels static and slightly redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Structure is essentially one continuous ritual scene that proceeds linearly from arrival to completion of the clearing, with no significant turn beyond deepening calm; this suits an accumulative lens but keeps tension low. Causality is simple and clear—prophet arrives → line walker creates space → wisdom is received—yet there is no on-page complication or reversal. The closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration: the line walker moves from anxious responsibility to peaceful readiness, but the cost of this shift is not strongly felt. Repetitive beats of “they will tend the clearing / preserve the echo of wisdom” blunt any sense of decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens: Luna arrives, photographs, feels reaffirmed, and leaves with her mission reasserted. Orientation is clear and the scene is continuous, but the structural arc is extremely gentle and nearly static. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (she reconfirms that “this was what she was meant to do”), with no visible cost or narrowed options. The repetition of similar beats (“she felt a sense of peace settle over her”) undercuts a sense of progression.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and clear: scholar researching in the hush, interruption by the visitor, decision to leave and testify, resolved in the walk into the waking city. Causality is intact but simple; once the summons arrives, no serious alternative path is dramatized, so the middle feels like extended mood rather than tightening pressure. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the decision to testify and step out of isolation, with some implied cost. The tribunal/testimony context and stakes remain vague, which blunts the impact of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: she moves through the garden, forgets, regains purpose via chalk, arranges driftwood, senses the presence, and reinterprets her goal. This works best under an accumulative/textural lens, where pattern more than event drives progression. Closure is present—a conceptual shift from “locating” a sound to accepting it as ambient and felt—but the cost is minimal and there is essentially no meaningful obstacle beyond haze and forgetfulness. As a result, the piece reads more like a single extended beat than a shaped arc with a decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, but major turns—like the decision to reinforce the observatory and the subsiding of the tremors—are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts causal force. The dominant drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: repeated motifs (clock hand, tremors, leaf, stars) build toward a conceptual repricing of “escape velocity.” Closure exists in Eli’s final reframing of escape, yet the cost of the journey is mostly asserted instead of shown (the observatory “held firm” with no real test on the page). Overall, the piece feels more like a thematic meditation than a fully dramatized story with tight causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward: diagnosis confirmation → decision to focus on goodbye → musical farewell → aftermath, with clean orientation and a legible closure in Emma’s peaceful death and Lena’s reflection. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, as atmosphere and ritual build toward the farewell rather than through sharp causal turns. There is minimal escalation: the mention of blood work is a hinge but not dramatized as a pressured decision point. Closure is present but quiet, with limited sense of irreversible choice beyond the inevitability of death.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece follows a simple evening-to-dawn observatory session, then time-jumps into summary of later recognition, so orientation is fine. Plot operates under an accumulative/textural lens: repeated mentions of research, key, and shadows build to the realization that the key is metaphorical. However, there is no strong on-page turn beyond “she finally understood,” which is reported rather than dramatized. Closure qualifies as a mild Conceptual Repricing, but cost and decisive change are soft, keeping structure mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single reflective scene in the garden with a clean orientation and a clear, if quiet, closure: Emilia leaves with a new guiding purpose. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural rather than causal, and that’s handled coherently—images and reflections build toward a final repricing of her recent experiences. However, there’s little genuine turn or complication between finding the tooth and the ending; the middle largely restates and elaborates her dawning clarity. Cost at closure is conceptual but faint, with no specific foreclosed path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens: one continuous scene of polishing and reflection, ending in a quiet completion image. Causality is simple and linear—sit, polish, feel deepened peace—without a meaningful structural turn. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration (the sea glass becomes a luminous “pearl of stillness”), but there is no felt price or narrowed option set. The reflection about purpose never concretely alters tactics, so structure feels more looped than shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece holds as a single, linear scene with a coherent accumulative/textural drive: Aria arrives wounded, experiences a nurturing environment and a silent encounter, then leaves reconfigured. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s meaning and her stance toward the outside world shift. Causality is soft but intact (“after the confession…she had come to this place,” then the garden and the figure soothe her), with no major orientation issues. The arc is more gentle drift than sharpened progression, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric drive, but structurally it loops: she’s blocked, sees shell/vision, then is suddenly unblocked without an intermediate tightening or concrete test of that shift. Causality is soft: the woman appears, encourages, vanishes, and the protagonist simply realizes it was her subconscious—there’s no decisive, pressured choice that clearly reconfigures her options. Closure exists (she leaves with renewed commitment), yet the cost is largely pre-summarized rather than earned through on-page turns. The beat sequence feels more like a reiterated affirmation than a progression with a meaningful hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Elara prepares the device, activates it, the villagers gather, and communal harmony is restored, giving a clear before/after. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the increasing focus on song, light, and gathering builds smoothly toward a resonant reconfiguration. However, causality is soft—the outcome is never seriously in doubt, and no choice sharply alters available options. Closure is present but costless, which limits impact at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a clean single ritual sequence that moves from preparation to completion, and the causal chain (prepare → enchant → seal → map appears) is easy to follow. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: pressure builds mainly through repetition of stillness and attention rather than through concrete reversals. Closure is present—Aria succeeds and the world is subtly reconfigured—but the cost of success is more asserted than dramatized, and no serious alternative path or threat is ever felt. This keeps the piece from achieving a more powerful Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with real bite.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a linear accumulative build: arrival, study, gradual attunement, completion, departure, which is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the device activates and Elian leaves altered in understanding, but the cost attached to that change is minimal. Time passing “across the lull of the wounded season” substitutes for on-page turns, so beats blur into one long, uniform process. The story keeps its drive lens (accumulative/textural) but never tightens options or introduces a real risk to Elian’s project.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece takes an accumulative/textural approach: she comes, weaves, leaves, and then we see the legend ripple outward. Orientation is clear and the closure unit (tapestry complete, lingering resonance in the community) is legible as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. However, the middle offers little structural tightening; events feel like a single extended beat stretched and then summarized into a legend. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatically earned, limiting impact for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative arc framed by the kettle’s boil and the carving’s completion. Orientation is immediate (widow, loft, recent loss), and the piece holds a consistent drive lens of textural accumulation. Closure lands via a quiet resonant reconfiguration: the carving is done, the kettle empty, and she can now live with the grief. However, the middle is fairly flat—little in the way of a distinct structural turn or escalated choice beyond continued crafting.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: the scavenger moves through the lagoon, gathers fragments, and culminates in the single photographic act, which functions as a quiet closure beat (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). Causality is simple but intact: the carousel’s halt leads to scavenging, which leads to collecting fragments, which leads to a culminating shot. However, the middle is structurally flat—many sentences restate the premise of gathering stories without distinct turns or complications. The cost of closure (what is foreclosed by taking the photo) is implied but not sharply articulated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is simple but coherent: she discovers the maze/sextant, explores, finds the pipes, reroutes them, and successfully revives the terminal, then leaves changed. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure is easy to follow, with a clear before/after at the end. However, the maze of intentions never meaningfully affects her tactics, and the “equations for hope” stay abstract, so several set-ups don’t fully pay off. Closure is present but low-cost and somewhat schematic, reading more like a summary of transformation than a dramatized culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: tower routine → garden walk → bear encounter → reflective resolution. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with atmosphere and reflection gradually building to a mild realization rather than a sharp causal turn. Closure lands as a quiet decision to “reconcile his love of nature with his life as a clock scribe,” but the cost of this decision is faint on the page. Some redundancy in later paragraphs (reiterating the same realization) slightly blurs the sense of a single, decisive closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is straightforward: a continuous search culminating in the discovery and a shift in understanding, with clean orientation in who/where/when. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece does build toward a closure image where the sundial reweights prior material. However, the path from legend to discovery is nearly frictionless, with no significant causal complications or setbacks. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing, but the lack of concrete obstacles blunts its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story is structurally coherent as a single continuous scene with clear orientation and a clean, if quiet, arc from arrival on the dock to departure after decoding. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the gradual thickening of fog and emergence of the code do provide a soft sense of progression. However, the decoding presents no real obstacles or turns; events proceed linearly from intention to success without complication. Closure functions as a modest resonant reconfiguration, but with minimal sense of cost or altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: wandering → noticing the thread → writing → quiet understanding, with no orientation issues. Closure functions as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting from oppressive silence to charged, almost musical stillness. However, causality is thin; beats are linked more by mood and verbal reflection than by clear because/therefore turns. The “cost” at the end is mostly conceptual and underplayed, which limits impact at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal throughline—prince in ruined world → finds egg → builds device → world’s beauty stirs—is clean and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Structure is simple but coherent, and the ending does deliver a Decisive Change plus a reconfiguration of his outlook. However, the cost of success is vague, and no earlier choice meaningfully constrains or complicates the climax. The result is solid but not structurally gripping, with more inevitability than tension.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a simple, linear structure (lagoon → call → tree graft → reflective return) with no orientation issues and a legible closure in Aria’s renewed commitment to healing. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: mood and motifs (fire, scars, black sand) layer toward a quiet reaffirmation. Causality is thin but intact; the radio call is mostly an excuse to stage the central metaphor rather than a genuine turning point. Closure lands, but the before/after gap is modest and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal line—feel the nudge, follow breadcrumbs, find door, open box, city revives—is clear and coherent. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the city shifts from stasis to rebirth, and Aria’s role redefines from seeker to guardian. However, the path is too frictionless: no real setbacks, false leads, or difficult decisions, so escalation feels outline-simple. The cost of success is conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps this comfortably functional but not elite.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions as an accumulative, lyric meditation rather than a causal plot, and that pattern is clear and consistent. There is a loose arc from wandering study to legacy (“a universe forever changed”), but the change and cost are mostly asserted rather than dramatized. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing—gentle light vs. fire—but the before/after line is soft. Structurally coherent, but not yet narratively compelling at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene that accumulates atmosphere until a conceptual shift at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats (finishing the carving, ghost’s arrival, poem, butterflies) link coherently to her growing insight. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—she “discovers the shape of collective grief”—but the cost of that shift is only lightly felt. There are no causality breaks, just a fairly low-intensity progression.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: contemplation at the tower, discovery of the rake handle, reading the inscriptions, and walking away toward a new beginning. Causality is present but soft—her turnaround hinges on conveniently found inscriptions that summarize the moral rather than on a pressured decision. Closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses a path toward incremental absolution, but the cost is lightly sketched. The accumulative/lyric drive is consistent, though the middle feels padded by repetition rather than new beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural: tending graves → entering silo → decoding tapestry → revelation. Causality is generally coherent but very low-pressure, with almost no genuine obstacles or turns beyond “works through the night and then understands more.” Closure does technically arrive—a reconfiguration of the gardener’s understanding and relationship to the cemetery—but the cost of that knowledge is barely articulated. The structure borders on repetitive, with multiple sentences that restate the same acts and realizations in similar language.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, lyric build toward a single charged-poise moment: the pen hovering over the blank page as the future is mentally “written.” Structure is coherent and linear, but there is almost no genuine turn—beginning and end share the same basic situation and intent. Closure just slightly reweights things with the assertion that the work “would prevail,” which lacks on-page causal justification or visible price. As a result the before/after is conceptually tidy but dramatically thin.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: tuning the radio → catching the broadcast → transcription → dust animation → quiet resolution. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration—she has captured the essence of the broadcast and the alcove becomes a narrative portal—but that shift costs her nothing and isn’t sharply contrasted with a meaningful “before” state beyond her ongoing quest. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, yet escalation is mild and the decisive shift at the end feels more like a gentle affirmation than a pressured change. As a result, the story is complete but not structurally gripping at a publish-now level.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is essentially linear: Lena encounters the portrait, reflects, speaks briefly with Eli, then performs the ash-scattering and leaves with a new understanding. Causality is intact but minimal, with events linked more by thematic commentary than genuine turns in options or stakes. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing—Lena revalues art’s impermanence—but the cost is abstract. The accumulation is coherent under a textural lens, yet the middle feels padded with repetition rather than a true escalation toward the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural structure: Kael in the sewer, reflecting on the plague, the sunken city, and his cog, leading to a quiet reaffirmation of purpose. Closure exists as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when he embraces his role (“Kael smiled… as he contemplated the long, hard road ahead”). However, there is minimal structural turn; most beats restate the same situation and motivation rather than narrowing options or reweighting stakes. The lack of a stronger mid-story shift keeps this from feeling fully shaped for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is coherent: she enters with a task, reflects while playing, and ends in a quiet recommitment, yielding a soft Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis. Causality is minimal but consistent—each image (zither, rosette, choir, leaves) builds toward the closing stance. However, the “before/after” line is faint; she begins already dedicated and ends similarly, with no clear new constraint, insight, or loss. The closure lands emotionally but without a strong sense of cost or altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrive for the alignment, find/plant the seed, cook, alignment peaks, dish and sprout close the arc. The drive is accumulative/textural rather than causal, and the pattern is legible throughout. Closure exists—a reconfiguration where Aria reframes her craft as healing and the greenhouse as crucible—but the decisive shift is largely told, with minimal on-page cost or narrowed options. The celestial alignment and knowledge fruit feel more like ordained blessings than hard-earned outcomes, softening structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: woman arrives → riddle → ascent → log discovery → reinterpretation of the beehive. This supports a modest Conceptual Repricing closure but with very low on-page stakes and no real complication or setback. The log functioning as a neat explanatory patch undercuts drama, though it does give the story a clear before/after. Structural pacing is even but a bit flat, with no pronounced tightening around a pivot moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and linear: bay → shop → shard purchase → house ritual → realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual and deepened perception provide a modest but legible closure via conceptual repricing of the house as “a living, breathing entity.” However, the stakes and price of this realization stay abstract; nothing in her options or circumstances is meaningfully foreclosed. The lack of a concrete complication or constraint keeps the arc from feeling fully shaped for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: the ampoule arrives, triggers understanding, and that understanding reframes the garden and the statue’s role. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing—the garden revalued from ruin to adaptive ecosystem and the statue from passive ornament to catalyst. However, the “cascade of revelations” is summarized instead of dramatized, and there’s little sense of risk or constraint shaping those turns. The structure reads more like a tidy explanatory arc than a pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative lyric rather than a causal plot, but even under that lens the escalation is modest: we start and end in essentially the same situation, with only a small shift toward acceptance. Closure qualifies as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he affirms being “forever bound to the infinite staircase”—yet the cost of that binding is more asserted than freshly felt in the final beats. Many lines reiterate the same relationship between stairs, dice, and obsession without generating new pressure or reconfiguration. Structure is coherent and orientation clear, but the arc is shallow for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: quiet contemplation → memory and reflection → decision to paint → completion at dawn, with a modest but legible before/after in her sense of purpose. The drive lens feels Accumulative/Textural, and under that lens the closure (her recommitment to the project) functions as a small Resonant Reconfiguration. However, causality is soft; almost everything “happens” as internal drift rather than pressured choice, and the cost of the decision remains abstract. Still, there are no orientation issues or outright breaks in logic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: tour → sealed frozen chamber → thaw → revelation → Elena’s renewed purpose. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the grotto redefined from refuge to active site of remembrance. However, the turns are more informational than pressured; no decision alters options in a costly way. The beekeeper reference feels like an unintegrated stub rather than a structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.0)
    Orientation and causal flow are clear: lighthouse → hunger stone → yoyo puzzle → radiance → resolve to continue journey. The piece hits a recognizable closure beat—he has unlocked the stone and chosen a new path—but the price for this is vague and largely rhetorical. The middle lacks complications or reversals; each step works on the first try. Closure qualifies as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration, but without sharpened constraints or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: advisor’s urging → entrance → poster → dream dictionary → mirror → apparition/blackout → exit. Closure is present as a before/after shift (entering naïve, leaving haunted), which reads as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration with psychological cost. However, many beats feel like a linear sightseeing tour of creepy objects rather than tightening causal pressure, and the blackout-to-outside jump sidesteps the climactic choice. Still, no major orientation issues or rule violations undermine structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: she reads the sky, plays the orchard, the music swells, then fades into a lingering final image. However, there is little sense of change beyond “she plays, then stops,” and the cost or consequence of the experience is vague. Closure is more a graceful diminuendo than a resonant reconfiguration that marks a before/after. Causality within the scene is fine, but the ending carries minimal narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Lyra deciphers patterns → triggers the cracking shell → discovers the map and note → decides to leave the city toward the watchers. Orientation is solid from the opening, with who/where/when quickly established. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she steps beyond the city toward an unknown but ominous horizon, with new knowledge about the expedition’s fate reweighting that choice. The structure is straightforward and functional, but the cost of the decision is only lightly sketched, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal throughline (go to station → find hidden room → study letter → emerge with truth) is clear and linear. However, there are no meaningful turns or complications: every step unfolds as expected, without setback, surprise, or cost. Closure exists—she succeeds in her stated goal—but the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned. The drive lens reads as weakly Causal with almost no pressure or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is straightforward accumulative lyric: arrive, survey, find object, reflect, depart. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and closure is a quiet resonant reconfiguration when the surveyor leaves the inkwell behind as a testament to absence; this before/after is legible but low-cost. Causality is minimal but coherent—each move plausibly follows the last without teleporting props or rule breaks. The lack of a stronger turn or consequence keeps the structure from feeling truly peak-ready for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative structure: Elara studies, hypothesizes, deciphers, annotates, and then departs with a reweighted sense of purpose. Causality is straightforward but low-pressure; each “then” feels like a continuation rather than an escalation, and there is no decisive external event or hard turn. Closure qualifies as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves with the stamp as emblem of a transformed relationship to the library and to her work—but the cost of that transformation is barely articulated. Orientation is clean and the lens is coherent, but the arc feels more like extended mood than fully shaped story.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: we move from working in the garden → contemplation of basilica/dreams → crane release → renewed work. There is on-page closure via a quiet reconfiguration—“a measure of peace” and grief beginning to “unfold”—but the path there is largely static, with minimal sense of before/after cost beyond stated solace. Causality between beats is mostly “and then he reflects” rather than pressured “therefore,” so structure feels more like a mood piece than a fully shaped story. Still, the arc is legible and never disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is legible: drone strike → flight to observatory → data analysis → revelation about unused potential → new purpose. However, most of the central action (the investigation) is summarized and unfolds without obstacles, making the structural arc feel outline-like. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing—reframing “unused potential” as catalytic—but the cost is carried mostly by the opening trauma rather than sharpened at the end. The drive lens reads as causal but without a meaningful, pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward—scan → signal → carvings → decoding → hidden chip → partial activation of the frequency—and easy to follow. However, there are no real setbacks or obstacles; each step succeeds on first try, so pressure never meaningfully tightens. Closure exists as a conceptual shift (the signal as existential belonging), but it’s cushioned, with little sense that any option has been foreclosed or any price paid. The piece reads more like a vignette of discovery than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    Structure is straightforward and legible: terrace → walk on shore → carvings/memory → renewed resolve, with accumulative, lyric pressure rather than sharp turns. Causality is soft but coherent (unease → walk → carvings trigger memory → decision to proceed). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid, but the cost is only lightly sketched and the decision doesn’t materially reconfigure options in a concrete way. The middle meanders in mood rather than driving toward a clearly tightened crossroads.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: stalled negotiations → her lunar-synced method → breakthrough → quiet aftermath. However, the key turns (the deadlock, the shift to “flow,” the resolution) are summarized rather than dramatized, so causality reads as declared instead of felt. Closure exists—she has achieved her goal and found peace—but the decisive change occurs largely off-page. This keeps the piece from a stronger structural impact despite a coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is straightforward and easy to follow: arrive at launch → reflect → paddle using utility poles → leave with renewed hope. Closure is present (he ends in a different emotional stance), but there’s minimal tightening of pressure—once he decides to paddle, everything trends linearly better. Many beats restate the same realization instead of adding new causal turns or constraints, which limits structural sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: ad → lake → discovery of the box → path revealed → decision to follow it. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural: atmosphere and symbolic objects accruing meaning rather than hard causal turns. Closure lands as a “journey begins” charged poise, but there’s little felt cost or decisive change beyond restating her intention with slightly heightened confidence. Most beats are lateral variations on awe plus resolve, not a true tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal line—traveler arrives, need is revealed, ritual is performed, metamorphosis begins—is clean and easy to follow, and closure lands with the ritual’s completion and Lyra’s new state. However, the path from setup to climax is almost frictionless; there are no setbacks, doubts that alter tactics, or costs that force a different choice. The fortune-cookie prophecy is introduced as a structural hinge but never materially complicates action. Closure functions, but without a strong sense of before/after cost beyond a stated “expansion.”

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is essentially a single meditative scene with embedded memories, operating under an accumulative/textural lens. There is a loose causal spine—card → saucer → book → realization—but the turns between these beats feel more associative than pressured. Closure exists as a mild conceptual repricing (“lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories”), yet the cost of that realization is only lightly implied. Overall, it coheres but lacks a strong sense of structural tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: Aurora moves to the storage bay, conducts the stitching ritual, accesses the memories, and unlocks the dimension, leading to her quasi-dissolution into legacy. The drive is largely accumulative/textural—each paragraph layers atmosphere and mission rather than escalating concrete obstacles. Closure exists (she succeeds and “fades” into the ship), but the cost and mechanics of opening the dimension are thinly dramatized and largely declarative. The “last human” and “locked dimension” stakes don’t significantly constrict her options in scene, which limits structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: beach walk → rock formation → prophecy and gift → reflective exit. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the hush and coincidences build toward a conceptual realization, and the ending does register as a before/after shift in worldview. However, causality is very soft—events feel fated rather than earned, and almost nothing is tested or jeopardized. The “cost” of the new understanding is barely visible, which weakens closure for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: blackout → coded message → deciphering → activation → spreading revolution, with a clear before/after closure. However, turns are frictionless: the coded sundial is solved instantly, the cradle activates without resistance, and there is no setback or real complication. The blackout’s “unexplained” nature is gestured at as fate rather than integrated into plot logic. Closure exists but lacks a felt price, so the structure reads schematic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discover stardust → perform ritual with rocks → vision and release of prophetic weight. Causality holds at a basic level, and the closure (vision and sense of completion) is legible on the page. However, stakes and complications remain abstract, so the decisive change feels more procedural than pressured. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the single-scene arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene: storm → vigil → envelope → reading → reconfiguration, which is coherent and easy to follow. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she reads her letter and re-sees the storm. Closure exists but the cost is soft; reading the letter produces insight without any felt risk or genuine possibility of refusal. Several beats (storm description, masks, scars) circle the same ground without adding new pressure or options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal spine is straightforward—waiting, imaginary fencing, opponent arrives, duel, victory, reflection—but the duel’s beats are mostly summarized, so turns feel soft. The hidden overture and sundial are set up but never concretely affect tactics in a way the reader can track. Closure qualifies as a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (he reframes victory as journey), but the cost is minimal and largely thematic. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear and consistent, but escalation is more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: from sitting on the steps, through reflection and decision, to entering and beginning the rebuild, closing on dawn. This reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a light causal spine (memories → decision → initial action). The closure—a reconfigured stance as the poet begins rebuilding and sees the city differently—lands cleanly, but the path there is relatively frictionless, with no serious setbacks or complications. The prison-library friendship is important causally but appears mostly in backstory rather than as an active structural beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: present in the arbor → discovery and use of the film reel → immersion in refuge world → decision to leave → altered return. Causality is straightforward (her actions drive each transition), and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-enters the initial space with a different relationship to her grief. Cost—the impossibility of staying in refuge—is on the page, though lightly felt. The accumulative/lyric drive is consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and legible, with an accumulative, ritual-like build from planting to monsoon. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration: Aria’s work is “complete,” her doubt replaced by conviction, and she vanishes into the rains. However, there is little in the way of on-page testing of her goal; the monsoon’s arrival is inevitable and uncontested, so the arc feels more like a description of a cycle than a story under pressure. Cost at the end is muted and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is simple but coherent: arrive on islet with sorrow → find compass → perform lace ritual → release compass → return home with partial peace. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual and release do form a mild Resonant Reconfiguration; there is a before/after in his relationship to regret. Causality is intact, but there is little tightening—once the compass appears, the path to resolution feels linear and unthreatened. The closure is on the page and legible, though the cost is understated and easily won.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative is static, lacking a causal chain or a closure unit with visible cost; the ending merely restates the initial mood. There is no inciting incident or rising action, only a linear sequence of observations and abstract reflections that fail to create a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks genuine causal tension; the inciting incident (unrolling the ledger) leads directly to a convenient resolution (matching frost patterns) without obstacles. Closure is achieved through an unearned epiphany ("peace," "purpose") that imposes no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The plot relies on coincidence rather than character action to solve the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear progression of success with no obstacles, reversals, or cost; the "heat-map" device functions as a magical solution that removes the difficulty of communication. Closure is unearned because no price—emotional or practical—is paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis spanning years rather than a dramatized story, violating the single-scene/mosaic scope expectation. The plot relies on "and then" sequencing with no causal friction; the inciting incident leads immediately to resolution without complication. Orientation drifts significantly as the timeline accelerates into a summary of "years passed."

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks a functional closure unit; it follows a linear chronological list of events ("As she..." loops) that reset to safety without cost or change. Causality is weak, as the community is already united and compliant, negating the need for the central scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure driven by the convenient arrival of a guide who resolves the plot's central tension without protagonist agency. Closure is a "soft reset" where breathing exercises instantly solve a centuries-old wound, lacking the required Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative structure depends on a convenient backstory skill ("hyperbolic geometry") appearing mid-crisis to resolve the central conflict instantly. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply integrates the experience without a visible price or irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline covering years of time rather than a dramatized scene with immediate stakes. Crucial conflicts, such as bypassing the guards, are summarized in a single clause ("slip past the sentries") rather than shown. Causality is weak; events happen because the script requires them, moving from one plot point to the next without organic friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension sequence ("As she worked," "As the night wore on") without a causal chain of choices. The resolution creates "symmetric satisfaction"—complete success with no cost or trade-off—resulting in a flat trajectory. The orientation of the setting (sunken yet under the sky) is physically confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative lacks a cohesive causal chain; events occur sequentially ("As the moon climbed," "As the train rumbled") without one event necessitating the next. Closure is absent; the ending ("one step closer to understanding") acts as a setup for a future story rather than a resolution of the current tension. There is no on-page cost or decisive change, merely a successful acquisition of items without obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative presents a linear sequence of successful actions without causal stakes or obstacles; the glassblowing proceeds without error. The closure ("never be alone again") acts as a soft reset, offering an unearned emotional resolution that does not follow causally from the mechanical tasks performed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central conflict, eliding the decryption process with "After what felt like hours of work." The resolution is a "soft reset" where an epiphany cures deep-seated phobias without cost, severing the causal link between action and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure where the protagonist achieves her goal exactly as planned without obstacles or causal friction. Closure provides symmetric satisfaction—she wants to draw the map and simply does so—lacking the required decisive change or felt cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative lacks a causal chain or a specific inciting incident; it reads as a summary of a state of being rather than a dramatized scene. The "loops" are delivered via expositional backstory rather than experienced in the present, robbing the story of structural tension. Closure is unearned because no gap between expectation and reality was ever established to be bridged.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative lacks causality, relying instead on a linear sequence of movements ("She stood," "She walked," "She stopped") with no escalating pressure or obstacles. The resolution is unearned and magical; looking through a lens simply "melts away" mistrust without explanation or cost. The ending claims a city-wide transformation based on one person's internal mood shift, which breaks narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative fails to establish a specific scene, relying entirely on habitual summary ("would polish," "would wander") that prevents causal progression. Closure is non-existent; the sunset ending offers no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance, merely the cessation of a routine.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot follows a linear A-to-B progression, but the central causal link—a holographic simulation generating a physical time portal—lacks established logic or grounded stakes. The ending resets the status quo (safe return) without a "felt cost" or decisive change, resulting in a low-impact resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is replaced by magical convenience; water revealing ink images is physically implausible and unexplained. Closure fails because the "message" is withheld from the reader ("spoke directly to Rachel's heart"), rendering the "forever changed" ending unearned and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal tension or visible cost. The resolution relies on summary explanation of a realization ("truth was not a fixed... thing") rather than a dramatized climax. The "swallowed truth" is an abstract MacGuffin that resolves into a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" sequencing without causal pressure; the explorer simply walks until they stumble upon the solution. The ending is a "Box with a Secret" failure: the "weighty truth" in the logbook is described as satisfying but never revealed to the reader, making the closure illegible and unearned. The discovery of the logbook is a convenient coincidence that resolves the plot without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized story, summarizing "untold seasons" and vast changes without anchoring the reader in a specific scene. Causality is arbitrary; the transition to the climax (burrowing) is triggered by an inanimate object's "cryptic folds" rather than mounting narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes "and then" sequence with no causal forcing; events happen to the characters (the eclipse) rather than resulting from their choices. The ending is an example of symmetric satisfaction/soft reset where the problem is solved immediately with no visible cost or sacrifice. The closure is unearned, resting on a guaranteed outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot is a linear sequence of events (enter, find, read, leave) devoid of causality or obstacles. Closure is asserted via summary ("she had finally uncovered the secrets") rather than earned through a decisive change or paid cost, failing the basic requirements for a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.1)
    Causality is asserted rather than dramatized; the narrative claims a "chain reaction" and that life is "altered forever," but provides no on-page mechanism for this change. The transition between the tavern and the lighthouse is slightly disorienting, and the closure relies on a summary of change ("life would never be the same") rather than a demonstrated shift in the character's status or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist succeeds without obstacle or sacrifice. The "possession" threat is introduced far too late (final paragraphs) to generate genuine pressure or causality. Closure is unearned, relying on a convenient "unraveling" without a decisive, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking causality or a distinct inciting incident; events happen sequentially ("As the...", "As they...") without logical necessity. The ending is a soft reset—a summary of feelings ("sense of resolve")—that offers no decisive change or cost, failing to meet the closure requirement. The drive lens is unclear, drifting between static observation and unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on abstract summary to bypass actual scene work; the climax ("confronted these echoes") is told rather than shown, stripping the story of causality. Problems are solved by fiat—she succeeds because the story says she has "mastery"—resulting in a resolution without earned change or visible cost. The logic is dream-like and disconnected, lacking a coherent causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc or a decisive change; it is a static vignette where time passes ("seasons turned") without altering stakes or options. Closure is nonexistent, offering only a declared emotional shift without an earned on-page cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central turn—decoding the message—is handled through abstract summary ("intuit the meaning... by progressing laterally") rather than concrete, observable action or logic. The ending provides only a change of intent without a visible cost or irreversible action taken on the page (a "soft" resolution). Causality is weak; the paranoia about being followed is introduced but immediately dropped to allow for "tranquility."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=2.1)
    The plot lacks agency; the climax is a passive event (lights turning on) followed by a soft reset where the protagonist simply feels better. There is no decisive change or on-page cost; the narrative relies on "and then" sequencing rather than causal progression. The closure is unearned, resolving deep grief through a momentary mood shift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear accumulation of "and then" observations without causal drive or orientation anchors beyond generic descriptions. Closure is nonexistent; the story ends with a costless realization ("deep understanding") that alters no stakes, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without Causal or Accumulative pressure; obstacles are removed immediately upon encounter (isolation ends when she finds the group; the hush ends when she plays). The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by a magical performance that demands no sacrifice or ingenuity. Orientation regarding the "shipwrecks" in a "rainforest" is spatially confusing and unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with no inciting incident, rising action, or climax; it simply chronicles a successful workday. The ending offers no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, merely the completion of a task and a departure, failing the pivotal closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a story, utilizing "and then" sequencing to summarize events and conversations without scenic pressure. The connection relies on a contrived backstory coincidence (the misdirected envelope) explained via exposition, and closure is a summary of future success rather than a scene-level shift.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or fable rather than a dramatized story, spanning "years" in the final paragraphs rather than resolving a specific scene. There is no causal tension; events happen sequentially without obstacles (search -> find -> create -> accepted). The ending violates the scope requirement for immediate on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a linear procedural: desire, action, success, exit. There is no complication or reversal; the magic system is convenient and unexplained ("weave a subtle spell"). Closure is a textbook "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the character gets exactly what she wanted with no visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative is a linear series of events without causal pressure or obstacles; the protagonist desires knowledge, performs a ritual, and receives it without cost or struggle. The closure is a "soft reset" where the character simply feels better, lacking a Decisive Change or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence: find object, remember past, place object, observe. Causality is soft; the decision to become "visible" feels unearned by the immediate stimulus of the tape reel. The ending lacks a decisive change or felt cost, settling for a "whispered rumor" that offers symmetric satisfaction rather than narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.0)
    The piece fails to render a scene, offering instead a summary of a season-long internal state without a concrete inciting incident or climax. There is no causal chain of events, only a progression of abstract realizations, and the "transformation" is asserted in the narration rather than earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or summary rather than a dramatized story, skipping over the actual investigation ("wild goose chase"). Causality is weak; the "rain trails" revealing codes is a convenient leap of logic, and the stranger's appearance is unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative reads as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized story, violating the scope expectation for a grounded scene. The causality is linear and friction-free: a gift arrives, is accepted, and powers update without complication or cost. There is no inciting crisis or meaningful obstacle to generate narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story violates the short-story scope by summarizing years of history rather than dramatizing a specific scene or shard. There is no on-page closure unit with visible cost; instead, the narrative relies on a "years later" retrospective summary of total success, bypassing the requirements for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is linear but relies entirely on summary for its climax; the "unraveling" of mysteries happens abstractly ("unfolded like a map") rather than through dramatized action. Causality is weak, as Emilia succeeds simply by walking forward without overcoming obstacles or making difficult decisions. The ending offers a "soft reset" where transformation is asserted ("forever changed") but not shown through a specific realization or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story functions as a summary of events rather than a dramatized scene, utilizing a "days passed" montage that dissolves narrative tension. Causality is weak; Emilia succeeds at her task simply because the narrative states she does, with no specific obstacles or turning points. Closure is abstract and low-cost ("sense of peace"), lacking a decisive change or realization earned by the action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, with events proceeding linearly without resistance or causal friction. The orientation is vague; the "escondite" is an abstract space, and the sequence of events lacks a felt "because/therefore" chain, relying instead on the protagonist simply willing things to happen.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a decisive closing event, ending instead on a setup for a future scene ("ready to start solving it"). The narrative consists of static waiting and off-screen negotiation, failing to establish causal momentum or on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions without causality or tension; events happen "as" time passes, not because of prior choices. Closure is nonexistent, offering a generic "promise of new stories" without a Decisive Change or felt cost. The structure relies heavily on "and then" progression rather than narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("As the days passed") that summarizes a process rather than dramatizing a specific scene, violating the scope for a short story and dissipating tension. Closure is asserted via abstract statement ("a sense of clarity emerged") rather than earned through a decisive change or cost on the page. The "death certificate" element is not causally integrated into the plot logic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where distinct actions (playing a shell on a cello) yield immediate, unearned magical solutions without causal necessity. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" victory that resolves all questions without visible cost, sacrifice, or logical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=1.0)
    The text is a synopsis rather than a narrative; it lacks a specific scene, a defined timeframe, or immediate causality. There is no orientation to a "now," and closure is a summarized outcome over time ("In the end...") rather than a dramatized event with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: arrive, find object via massive coincidence, receive message, take photo, leave. There is no causal chain or meaningful turning point; the "pressure" to outlast is introduced by a message and immediately resolved by the character simply finishing her task.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot logic relies on "auspicious" coincidence (the ship's vibrations) and magical thinking rather than protagonist agency or causal progression. The resolution is unearned and lacks a "Decisive Change" or felt cost; the repair succeeds simply because the environment strikes a harmonious chord.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot advances through unearned convenience—specifically the "peculiar pattern" of condensation that functions as a deus ex machina to reveal the location. The narrative structure is a linear list of events without causal pressure or setbacks. The ending lacks closure or cost; the protagonist simply continues walking, with no decision that forecloses other options.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural lacking a decisive causal turn or cost; the town's revival is a guaranteed outcome of the tuner's arrival. Closure is a generic "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by a single, unresisted method, failing to create a resonant reconfiguration of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear summary of task completion lacking genuine obstacles or reversals; the process of "unsnarl[ing]" is abstract and convenient. The premise of being a "distress signal sender" logically contradicts the mission-based rescue setup, creating a muddled causal chain. Closure is unearned, relying on a soft "mission accomplished" reset without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear walkthrough with no obstacles or causal turns; the door is ajar and the lock yields instantly. The ending fails the closure requirement, introducing a disconnected stake ("bodies") in the final paragraph that is neither set up nor resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where X happens, then Y happens, without causal complication or risk. The resolution is an "explain-everything" ending where success is instant and the "debt" is repaid without any dramatized cost or difficulty. The drive lens is nominally causal but lacks the friction of a true obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal linkage or meaningful obstacles; the resolution (world transformation) is unearned and relies on "magical" assertion rather than plot logic. The closure lacks any visible or felt cost; the ending is a repetitive summary of themes rather than a dramatic event. The drive lens is unclear, oscillating between vague accumulation and unearned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative fails to form a scene, relying instead on a montage summary ("days turned into weeks") that dissolves narrative tension. There is no specific inciting incident within the frame, nor a causal chain of choices; events happen because the author wills them, not because the character acts under pressure. Closure is a generic "mission accomplished" state without a felt price or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks (writing, encoding, mailing) without causal friction, orientation debt, or meaningful turning points. The ending fails the Closure requirement as there is no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no stakes are altered, and no cost is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("As the days passed") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default for short fiction. Closure is an assertion of success ("knew that they had succeeded") without a decisive on-page turn, action, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist succeeds immediately at every step without causal friction or complication. Closure is a "soft reset" (the spirit dissipates, she feels better) that feels unearned because no visible cost was paid to achieve it. The structure is merely a sequence of events: she goes, she sees, she does, she leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks causality or a structural arc; it is a static sequence of observations ending in a soft reset via anesthesia ("thoughts dissolved"). The resolution is unearned, as deep anxieties are "laid to rest" simply by looking at a cast, with no visible cost or process.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal complications or setbacks; Lena finds the object and immediately succeeds. Closure is a tidy resolution ("rediscovered the lost joy") with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights options. The "knowledge network" insertion breaks scene causality, appearing as an expository lump.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with a symmetric satisfaction ending where the problem is solved by magic without consequence. There is no orientation debt, but the lack of resistance and the "explain-everything" happy ending void any sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=1.8)
    The piece is a synopsis spanning seasons rather than a dramatized story; it violates the single-scene/two-shard scope default without earning the mosaic track. There is no specific inciting incident or climax in a present moment, only a generalized timeline of events ("As the days passed"). Closure is a vague summary of legacy rather than a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (looks, sings, sleeps) without causal pressure or meaningful escalation. The ending functions as a "soft reset"—she simply feels better—lacking a decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration of the status quo. The "insomnia" conflict is resolved instantly and conveniently, undercutting narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story is a static vignette that loops without a causal arc; the ending merely reiterates the opening state ("continued her work") with no change in values or knowledge. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a causal turn; the protagonist begins a task, succeeds without obstacle, and leaves. Closure is a soft reset of emotion ("silence... dissipate") without a distinct cost or decisive change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative lacks a functional drive lens, existing as a static vignette with no causal chain or escalation. Closure is a summarized emotional state ("sense of peace") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. The "method" is buried in backstory summary, robbing the present moment of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc or genuine closure. The sequence of events (tending birds, looking at dust, feeling peace) creates no pressure and requires no cost to resolve. The ending is an unearned return to stasis without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of convenience where obstacles dissolve immediately upon inspection of the logbook. Closure is unearned and symmetric—the protagonist gains the father and peace without paying any visible cost or enduring a reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear summary of success with no causal friction or orientation; the ritual works simply because the text says so. Closure is costless and vague ("secrets safe, yet somehow, forever changed"), failing to provide a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=1.8)
    The plot is a linear walk-through driven by convenience rather than causality; the central obstacle is resolved by a *deus ex machina* (the bird seeds) rather than agency. The closure relies on an abstract summary of a realization ("flux and transformation") with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a flat linear sequence (setup, perform, succeed, pack up) lacking an inciting incident, rising action, or climax. The closure is non-existent; the story loops back to the start without a decisive change or reconfigured stance. The reliance on "and then" sequencing creates no causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes "and then" structure without causal tension or a defining turning point that carries cost. The spatial logic breaks during the climax: she becomes "anchored" to the stone by hand yet simultaneously "twirled and leaped across" it, creating a confusing physical impossibility that undermines the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative lacks a causal chain, inciting incident, or a valid closure unit (Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing). It functions as a static vignette of observation without rising action, stakes, or a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "walk and think" structure with no causal friction or meaningful obstacles. The inciting incident (opening the box) leads to an unearned epiphany without cost or complication. Closure is asserted through a label change ("messenger") rather than a demonstrated shift in tactics or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative lacks causality or tension; the protagonist sits, has a vision, and smiles without any complication or cost. The ending is a "soft reset" that resolves nothing because nothing was at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative relies on weak "and then" sequencing with zero causal pressure; clues are found immediately (diaries in a fireplace) without obstacle. The story dissolves into summary ("As the days turned into weeks") rather than sustaining a scene, violating the scope default. Closure is unearned, resting on a summarized realization rather than a decisive change or action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without resistance; the protagonist intends to do magic, does it, and succeeds without complication. Causality is soft, relying on "and then" progression rather than "because/therefore" pressure. The closure is a "success" state that lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of value.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative relies wholly on summary to bypass the inciting incident and climax ("negotiations progressed," "voices growing more conciliatory"). Causality is absent; peace is achieved through atmospheric assertion rather than a decisive on-page event or negotiation, resulting in a hollow resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=2.5)
    Causality collapses at the climax; the exposition establishes a need to "navigate complex interests," but the resolution is a disconnected magical gesture (raising an egg) that instantly fixes the drought. The mechanism of the solution—using cracks as a map to release water—lacks logical grounding or physical plausibility, rendering the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative arc is linear but fundamentally abstract; the central action—untangling threads of "societal norms"—confuses metaphor with physical reality, leaving the reader unsure if the character is performing a task or merely thinking. Causality is magical rather than earned, with the "unlocking" of reality happening because the plot demands it, not through logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking a closure unit, meaningful tightening, or cost. Amaranth enters, succeeds at her task without obstacle, and leaves; the ending is a soft reset where the environment solves her problem automatically.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a functional drive lens; events occur sequentially ("Aria sat," "Aria rose") without causal linkage or accumulating pressure. The ending is a soft reset where the character simply leaves, offering no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost. The story fails to anchor the reader in a specific "when" or "why," drifting through a generalized timeline without stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal pressure or obstacles; the success is immediate and guaranteed. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" failure where the protagonist achieves exactly what she sets out to do with no visible cost, trade-off, or risk, rendering the ending hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events with no causal friction; the protagonist solves the central mystery simply by choosing to dream, encountering no resistance. Closure is weak, offering a "happy for no reason" exit ("world reborn") without a paid cost or meaningful transformation. The orientation is vague, relying on generic "ancient" signifiers rather than a grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence (&quot;and then he did this&quot;) lacking genuine causality or obstacles. The closure—a cosmic covenant—lands without a visible price or trade-off, relying on the &quot;explain-everything&quot; anti-pattern where the universe simply responds to the protagonist's desire. The transition between the deciphering and the ritual is smooth and frictionless, devoid of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot is driven by a Deus Ex Machina where the broken music box spontaneously plays itself, removing protagonist agency from the climax. The narrative structure is a summary of spiritual success rather than a causal chain of events, lacking a "because/therefore" progression or a felt cost for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality relies heavily on "inexplicable connections" and dream logic that feels unearned. A significant credibility gap exists: the protagonist manipulates "molten" glass in a ruined orchard with no mention of a kiln or fuel, breaking physical plausibility. The narrative arc is a linear progression of convenient successes without complication or cost. Closure is achieved through a "vanish" trope that erases stakes rather than resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative violates the short story scope by summarizing years of time ("years ago," "as the days passed") instead of dramatizing a specific scene with causal tension. The resolution—Aria's return—is a coincidence driven by the timeline, not a consequence of the protagonist's specific choices in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear tour without causality or resistance; events happen to the protagonist rather than resulting from their actions. The ending relies on an unearned epiphany handed over by a secondary character, lacking the required cost for valid closure. The structure is purely episodic ("and then") rather than driven by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary for pivotal events ("embarked on a series of rescue missions," "forced to renegotiate"), which destroys causal tension and pacing. The climax is resolved too easily without a dramatized struggle or visible cost, failing to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a linear "and then" structure without genuine causality; the ship conveniently drifts to the destination exactly when the protagonist solves the riddle, a deus ex machina that robs the ending of earned resolution. The brevity (well under the expected scope) reduces the plot to a synopsis-like summary of events rather than a dramatized arc. The transition from drifting listlessly to purposeful movement is unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative lacks causality or tension; the resolution (weaving a rope to fix a "fable") is abstract magic without logical grounding or consequence. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem dissolves instantly, failing the requirement for closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is linear and frictionless, lacking a true inciting incident or rising action; obstacles are resolved immediately via "conjuring" without failure or adaptation. Closure is unearned as the solution ("bloom of hush") functions as a magic button with no visible, felt, or conceptual cost. The causality is weak, relying on the antagonists simply deciding to cooperate because the protagonist imagined peace.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist finds a key and immediately uses it without obstacle or complication. The pacing is repetitive, and the resolution lacks the required Decisive Change or felt cost, reading as a convenient victory rather than an earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal pressure or an inciting incident to disrupt the status quo. The ending ("sense of peace") is unearned by any prior sacrifice, risk, or difficult decision, resulting in a "soft reset" closure. The drive lens is weak, relying on "and then" progression rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot is a linear sequence of observations with a coincidence-based resolution (finding the note) that lacks causality or cost. The narrative arc relies on a "soft reset" where the protagonist's problem (lack of inspiration) is solved instantly by an external object, bypassing any meaningful struggle or decision. Orientation is functional, but the closure offers no reconfiguration of stakes, merely a shift in stated mood.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking causality, inciting incident, or rising action; the figures move on independently of the protagonist's presence. There is no on-page closure unit (Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing); the ending relies on unearned declared peace without cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the inciting problem (claustrophobia) is resolved by a magical external force (the hush) without protagonist effort. Closure fails the cost requirement; the ending is a "soft reset" that grants peace without requiring a sacrifice or difficult trade-off. Causality is replaced by a sequence of occurring events.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc, inciting incident, or rising action. Events occur in a linear "and then" sequence without necessity; the ending is a mere cessation of activity (sunset) rather than a resolution derived from character agency or cost. The story fails to establish a drive lens, remaining an atmospheric description rather than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a "video game walkthrough" structure where obstacles are immediately resolved by convenient tools (the ruby flake acts as a universal skeleton key). There is no causal friction; X leads to Y because the plot demands it, not because of character ingenuity. The closure is a "Decisive Change" in status, but it feels unearned because the protagonist meets no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the problem (fading threshold) is solved immediately by a simple touch without complication or cost. The inciting incident and resolution are mechanically linked, but the lack of obstacles strips the story of causal tension. The happy ending feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies on an "and then" summary structure devoid of causal linkage; events happen because the plot requires them, not because of character agency. The climax is a deus ex machina where "strange energy" resolves the conflict instantly without logic or cost. Closure is purely positive and unearned, failing the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.3)
    The plot is a linear sequence of events without causal friction or resistance; the character turns a crank and immediately receives the solution. The ending is unearned summary, asserting a "decisive change" and "newfound understanding" without dramatizing the process or the cost required to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression without causal rigor; events happen because the plot requires them, not because of logical necessity (e.g., the arbitrary link between the snap and the greenhouse energies). Closure is achieved through a "power-up" ending where the protagonist gains a reward without paying a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on summary montage (&quot;days turned into weeks&quot;) rather than a specific scene, violating the single-scene/shard scope without teaching a mosaic pattern. The central causal mechanism—reading a biography from &quot;accumulated dust patterns&quot;—breaks verisimilitude without establishing a magical realist rule set, and the ending is a static statement of feelings rather than a closure event.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence ("Aria stood," "Aria knew," "Aria reached") without causal pressure or necessary obstacles. Closure is a soft reset (she smiles and leaves) that lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending is symmetric satisfaction rather than an earned turn. The inciting trigger ("when plans unravel") is abstract summary rather than an on-page event.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence of success without causal pressure, obstacles, or a decisive change; the resolution ("prophecy has been laid to rest") is unearned by the action on the page. The orientation is abstract, and the ending relies on summary rather than a dramatized shift in value.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes "and then" progression with no causality beyond magical convenience. The ending ("forever changed," "brighter... future") is an unearned assertion of happiness without the required Decisive Change or felt cost, failing the closure criteria completely.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot follows a linear "and then" sequence with no causal friction; obstacles are nonexistent (he finds the item immediately, the device builds itself). Closure is unearned, relying on a declared change in internal state ("newfound sense of confidence") without a visible or felt cost. The drive lens is weak, as events unfold via convenience rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies on synopsis-style summarizing ("As the weeks turned into months") rather than a concrete scene with causal linkage. The closure is achieved through the passage of time and asserted success, not a decisive on-page action or realization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural vignette lacking a decisive change or felt cost; the soul is found, confesses instantly, and departs without resistance. The "crocodile's tooth" is introduced as a secret but has no causal impact on the resolution. The ending relies on a "sense of satisfaction" rather than a reconfigured stake.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative suffers from a "soft reset" ending where the forest magically resolves the conflict without earned causality or cost. The climax is an abstract epiphany ("mind expanding") that bypasses the need for genuine struggle or logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.7)
    The plot advances through coincidence (the painting just happens to contain the specific lens fragment she bought) and abstract realization rather than causality. The ending is a "promise to act" in the future ("she would weave a new narrative") rather than an on-page closure event with visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is weak, relying on "video game logic" where analyzing dust arbitrarily reveals a hidden compartment. The narrative lacks a drive lens; events occur sequentially without necessary linkage. Closure is a soft reset with no visible cost; the protagonist leaves exactly as she arrived, merely holding a new object.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on summary and "and-then" sequencing rather than a causal chain of pressurized scenes. The inciting incident (finding the bottle) is convenient, and the climax is resolved through a montage of work ("as the prints accumulated") rather than a specific, difficult choice. Closure is asserted via a "legacy" summary rather than an earned, on-page shift.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: find object, analyze object, feel good. The central causal link—solving a scientific archaeological dispute by writing a poem—lacks logical grounding and narrative friction. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the character succeeds without cost, trade-off, or meaningful change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression (task → method → success) with no causal turns or reversals. The closure is a symmetric resolution where the problem is solved exactly as intended; the "dimmer" chip offers a theoretical cost that is not felt or weighed by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=2.3)
    The narrative is a linear progression of movement ("and then") without causal linkages or obstacles to force a deviation. The closure—becoming "one with the lagoon"—is an abstract ascension that dissolves the character without a legible cost or decisive change in the story's reality. The "factory" backstory is irrelevant to the immediate causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear summary of events lacking causal tension or a decisive turning point; the GPS failure is convenient backstory rather than a source of pressure. Closure is unearned ("satisfaction and wonder") because no meaningful obstacle was overcome and no price was paid to achieve the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story fails to dramatize a scene, instead summarizing a season-long timeline ("As the days passed," "As the last snow melted") which dilutes all tension. Closure is purely additive—a gained realization—with no decisive change, trade-off, or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without causal pressure or a legible closure unit (DC/RR/CR). The resolution—sudden understanding of the diary—arrives via summary during the parley without an on-page cost or trade-off. The ending defers resolution ("knew she would return") rather than landing a decisive change in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=2.3)
    The narrative relies on magical thinking rather than causality; the town revives simply because the alchemist thinks hard about it, with no mechanical linkage between action and result. The structure collapses from a scene into a summary montage ("days turned into weeks") without earning the transition. Closure is a generic "success" state with no visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot relies on a linear sequence of events ("began to work," "memory surfaced") without causal tightening or active turns. Closure fails to land a specific on-page cost, relying instead on a summary of future consequences ("only just beginning") that defers the narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension sequence ("and then") where magic functions without logic or cost. The ending relies on a "Conceptual Repricing" regarding the vortex inheritance, but this realization arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than the result of narrative pressure or a decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing long periods ("As the days passed," "As the seasons passed") instead of dramatizing a decisive scene. Closure is a low-stakes summary of success without a distinct event or paid price to mark the change.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=1.9)
    The narrative is a static sequence of observations with no causal drive, rising action, or orientation beyond generic markers. Closure fails completely as there is no decisive change, reconfiguration, or paid cost; the ending merely restates the opening stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression (approach box, open, read, close) with no causal complications or obstacles. The "tangled covenant" is introduced as a major stake but is abandoned, playing no role in the scene's mechanics or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative violates the short story scope by summarizing a long duration ("As the days turned," "With each passing day") instead of dramatizing a specific scene with urgency. Closure is abstract ("ready for whatever came next") and lacks a visible cost or decisive change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.4)
    The structure is a linear "and-then" sequence with a "soft reset" ending that resolves all tension without cost. The inciting incident (feather) and climax (kite snap) are treated as convenient symbols rather than causal pressures, leading to symmetric satisfaction where the world remains perfectly harmonious. The narrative explains its own resolution rather than letting it land through action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative violates the short story scope by summarizing months of time rather than dramatizing a specific scene or crisis. There is no inciting incident on the page, merely a backstory summary, and the plot progresses linearly without causality or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative is a strictly linear procession without causality, obstruction, or reversal; the character walks to a location and receives an epiphany instantly. Closure is asserted via abstract statement ("realized that the artificial pilgrimage had been a journey of self-discovery") rather than dramatized change or cost. The lack of obstacles renders the "climax" flat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=2.3)
    Causality is broken by severe logic errors: the coachman releases horses to graze on "lush vegetation" in a spot described moments earlier as a "dying" reef and "barren ground." The resolution creates instant magical terraforming without earned cost or time, dissolving narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot advances via extreme convenience; the riddle is found on a nearby crate, and the solution is instantly available in a previously found object. The central journey is compressed into summary ("hours of walking"), bypassing all causal obstacles and eliminating the potential for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks genuine causality; sketching the stars triggers the compass to glow through unexplained video-game logic rather than established narrative rules. The closure—walking toward a light—is a cost-free change in location that resolves nothing emotionally or conceptually. The story confuses chronological sequence with plot, missing a true inciting incident or crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear task completion list with no causal complication or obstacle; the "danger" is stated but never dramatized. Closure fails the required standard: the problem is solved perfectly with no visible or felt cost, resulting in a simplistic "happy ending" that lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing with unexplained mechanics; how walking "spells out words" on a floor remains physically unintelligible, breaking causal grounding. The alliance forms instantly without pressure or dilemma, leading to a resolution that feels like a prompt-checklist completion rather than an earned narrative turn. There is no visible cost to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist simply finds the object and resolves the plot with magic. Closure is unearned, offering a "soft reset" of reality without any legible cost or logical causality linking the feather to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing with zero causal pressure; the tapestry reveals a map and the labyrinth grants peace simply because the plot demands it. The ending is a "soft reset" where guilt vanishes without cost or logical groundwork, failing the requirement for a decisive change earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear series of assertions with weak causality; the "ritual" and "mist" operate on arbitrary dream logic without resistance. The ending devolves into a repetitive summary of themes rather than a concrete narrative event or earned realization. The closure unit is buried under redundant exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.8)
    Spatial and physiological logic collapses; the protagonist is described as "holding her breath" and "breaking the surface" inside a workshop situated *above* the sea, while simultaneously "narrating" aloud, which is impossible while holding breath. These contradictions disorient the reader and break causality. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without earning it through logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.6)
    The plot pivots on a coincidence (taking a "wrong turn" to find a magical oasis) rather than character agency. The ending dissolves into a summarized projection of the future ("Years would pass..."), violating the requirement for on-page closure with a specific scenic cost. The drive lens is unclear because events happen sequentially without causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows an "and then" structure lacking causal tension or meaningful turns; the protagonist descends, performs a ritual without obstacle, and ascends. Closure is a "soft reset" (an unearned feeling of peace) without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration involving visible cost. The drive lens is unclear, drifting between weak accumulative and abstract situational modes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative operates as a summary of a long duration rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short story scope defaults without earning a mosaic or lyric exception. The "ending" (feeling peace upon reaching a plain) is a soft reset that resolves the abstract conflict without cost or logical causality. There is no scene-level pressure; events simply happen sequentially in a generalized timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative reads like a synopsis or outline rather than a dramatized scene, relying on "As they [verb], [result]" summaries to advance the plot. Events occur through convenience ("stumbled upon," "search led them") rather than causal agency. The closure is a summarized state of mind ("felt a sense of resolve") without a concrete action or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no causal progression or pressure; the protagonist simply watches a stranger leave. The closure ("investigate further") is a non-ending that defers the actual story, offering no decisive change or realized cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative progresses through "and then" sequencing rather than causal linkage, relying on dream logic where a rising creek recedes simply because the protagonist "chose a path." The ending lacks a decisive change with paid cost; the resolution is a convenient, unearned restoration of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.6)
    Closure is structurally absent; the story ends by summarizing that a "truth" was found without revealing it to the reader ("seen the secrets that lay within"). This "journey just begun" ending is a cliffhanger, not a resolution, and fails the basic requirement of a self-contained narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without genuine causality or cost. The inciting incident (hearing a whisper) leads immediately to success through "concentration," lacking any complication or necessary failure that would earn the resolution. The closure is a "soft reset" into peace and shared understanding without a visible price paid for the insight. The orientation is functional, but the plot lacks the pressure required for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a "soft reset" pattern where the conflict is resolved by the writing process without visible cost, trade-off, or complication. The inciting incident (seeing the grave) is stated in backstory but does not exert causal pressure on the present-moment scene, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is static, functioning as a container for internal monologue rather than a causal sequence of events. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or meaningful change; the ending reiterates the opening state without cost or reconfiguration. The drive lens is absent, as the scene lacks accumulation of pressure or situational complication.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where success is immediate and costless. The ending creates "symmetric satisfaction"—the writing succeeds, the storm parts, and a sunset appears—without forcing a trade-off or exacting a price from the protagonist. The "tremors" introduce instability that is never realized as a causal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "find object, use magic, succeed" path with no causal complications or cost. Closure is a "soft reset" where a magical transmission resolves the central relational conflict instantly, lacking the required decisive change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.1)
    The plot relies on a convenient external event ("hiccup") and resolves through undramatized magic ("wove together disparate threads"). Causality is weak, with no earned cost or logical progression of events leading to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative structure relies on linear sequencing without a causal drive, inciting incident, or rising action. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" (sunset, sunrise) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, failing the closure requirement. The story reads as a static vignette that resets to the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure is linear but lacks causality; the climax is an unearned realization ("profound discovery") triggered by looking at mushrooms and a laser pointer without logical linkage. The ending explains the theme rather than dramatizing a change, failing the closure requirement for a legible cost or reconfiguration. Orientation is clear, but the plot is a static sequence of observations.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative breaks the short-story scope with a summary montage ("As the days passed") that dissolves tension instead of building a specific scene. Closure is weak; the protagonist merely plans to act ("outline a new approach") rather than making a decisive change or paying a cost on the page. The causal link between subway graffiti and curing addiction is tenuous and lacks narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=1.5)
    The narrative is a static summary of a routine without a dramatized scene, inciting incident, or causal chain. It relies entirely on iterative habit ("would often," "began to notice") rather than a specific, unfolding event. Closure is absent; the story ends with a reiteration of the stasis described at the beginning, offering no cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or dramatic arc; it is a linear sequence of observations followed by a repetitive summary of the future. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive moment of closure with cost; the ending dissolves into abstract moralizing rather than a dramatized event. Causality is absent, replaced by "and then" sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and time-lapsing ("As the night wore on") rather than causal scene work. The inciting incident (whispering rumors) leads directly to the resolution without complication or obstacle, resulting in a flat trajectory devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unhindered success, lacking the required closure unit of a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," where the goal is achieved exactly as anticipated without complication. There are no causal obstacles to generate pressure or reweight the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, moving from setup to resolution without causal pressure or obstacles. The pivotal action—unbending the nib—succeeds via asserted "contingent relationships" rather than a logical causal chain or effort, and the closure dissolves the established problem (the weeds) without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression ("and then") without a drive lens that forces choices or costs. The closure is an unearned "soft reset" where magic solves a vague problem without sacrifice or logical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative operates as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized story, spanning "days" and "years" within a short text, violating the single-scene scope without establishing a mosaic structure. The ending offers abstract thematic assertions rather than a dramatized closure event with cost. Orientation is contradictory; "fluorescent lights" in a "lost civilization" archive lacks causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure lacking causal pressure or resistance; events happen because the character wills them without complication. Closure is a soft reset of unearned peace, devoid of the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal linkage between events; finding the coin, the key, and the stranger are random occurrences. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist simply declares her point proven without any dramatized cost or struggle. The "closure" is unearned, as the stranger's whisper resolves the abstract challenge by coincidence rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is driven by dream logic that lacks grounding; the appearance of "shutters of a nearby window" on a dock breaks spatial orientation without explanation. The narrative arc is static, ending in a soft reset where tension merely dissipates without a decisive change or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.7)
    The story suffers from a catastrophic break in causality; Elian "orchestrates" physical window displays solely "in his mind," yet the world is physically transformed the next morning without dramatized action. The resolution is unearned, relying on a magical leap from visualization to societal change that bypasses execution and plausible difficulty. It reads as a summary of intent rather than a structured narrative with a functional beginning, middle, and end.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=2.6)
    The plot is a linear sequence of compliance with no resistance, complication, or cost. The resolution—that the island is a "state of being"—is an unearned conceptual reset that dissolves the narrative goal rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative operates as a broad summary of a timeline ("As the days passed") rather than a specific, anchored scene. There is no causal chain of events, only a sequence of described states. The ending is a thematic fade-out that fails to provide a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a low-friction "and-then" sequence where obstacles are nonexistent and the environment immediately cooperates with the protagonist's desires. The closure is a "soft reset" that asserts transformation ("forever changed") without earning it through on-page causality or price. The "ban" mentioned in the opening is purely ornamental backstory that does not pressure the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=2.8)
    The piece functions as a synopsis or fable rather than a dramatized story, lacking a concrete scene with causal pressure. The narrative dissolves into generalities ("As the days passed") rather than delivering a closure unit with visible cost. The resolution is unearned, as the glassblower converts to the protagonist's view immediately without obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story suffers a catastrophic failure of closure due to the meta-commentary ("to meet the word count, we will stop here") which shatters narrative immersion. Even prior to this, the plot is a linear sequence of events with no causal pressure or decisive change. The narrative lacks a drive lens, meandering through descriptions without escalating stakes or necessary action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.1)
    The plot follows a linear "and-then" sequence with no resistance or complication; the magical mechanism (origami) functions as a convenience to instantly solve the central problem. Closure is a "Soft Reset" where grief evaporates in the presence of pretty lights without any visible cost, trade-off, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a causal arc or a decisive closure unit; it functions as a static vignette where the ending is triggered by the arrival of dawn rather than a resolution of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a summary rather than a dramatized scene, lacking a functional causal chain or inciting incident. The resolution is unearned; the protagonist is handed a solution (the pagoda) that instantly resolves the intellectual conflict without cost or complication. The pacing is flat, moving from exposition to conclusion without a pivotal turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on chronological sequencing ("As she read," "As she watched") rather than causal progression. The climax is an internal realization with no external trigger or cost, and the closure—walking away to "share findings"—lacks a decisive change or sacrifice to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks forward momentum or causality; it is a static reflective block that resolves via a "soft reset" (she simply decides to feel peace) without cost. The inciting context ("the con") is dropped immediately and never shapes the plot or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist wants something, digs for it, and finds it without meaningful obstacles or cost. The "soft reset" ending provides total satisfaction without a trade-off or decisive change in stance. The logic operates on dream-like convenience (earth yielding like a confidant) rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where the protagonist faces no obstacles, ending in a "symmetric satisfaction" that resolves nothing because nothing was at risk. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost," offering only a tidy, unearned sense of resolution that fails the rubric's closure definition.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative lacks causality, relying on a "soft reset" structure where the environment spontaneously resolves the protagonist's problem without effort or cost. Orientation is vague ("archway" lacks spatial grounding), and the ending feels unearned, violating the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal pressure or complications. The climax is a visual spectacle rather than a narrative turn, and the ending is a soft reset where the protagonist re-solidifies and leaves unchanged. Closure is absent; there is no legible cost or reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of "and then" events with no causal pressure or mounting tension. The ending is a "starter gun" conclusion that promises a future journey rather than providing on-page closure with cost or reconfiguration; the protagonist ends exactly where he began, merely "changed" in an abstract sense.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" progression of walking and arriving without causal turns, obstacles, or meaningful deviation. The closure is a symmetric arrival that fulfills the initial promise without cost, reconfiguration, or surprise, lacking a drive lens that accumulates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary in the final third, skipping over the actual process of change ("days turned into weeks") rather than dramatizing a closure unit. The ending offers a generalized explanation of healing rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration on the page, stripping the conclusion of immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on heavy summarization ("days turned into weeks") to bypass the rising action, failing to dramatize the process of discovery or trap-setting. The climax lacks causality; the resolution is a deus ex machina where the antagonist crumbles instantly upon being spoken to, devoid of tactical logic or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot follows a linear, low-tension path where a vague curiosity is resolved by a cost-free philosophical pivot ("truth... in the rhythms"). The "delayed revelation" is asserted as a simile rather than a structural turn, and the closure lacks a felt price or meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative functions as a linear summary rather than a scene, lacking a causal chain of resistance and consequence. The resolution is a classic *deus ex machina* where the environment solves the internal conflict without the protagonist paying a visible cost or navigating a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot advances through convenient intuition ("she had a feeling," "she had a hunch," "she knew") rather than causal logic or investigation. The discovery of the kite and the location of the artifact are serendipitous, lacking earned discovery. Closure is achieved without cost or trade-off, resulting in unearned symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive; the resolution is a spontaneous mood shift facilitated by the environment rather than protagonist agency. The closure—an unearned sense of peace—acts as a soft reset with no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on asserted healing rather than causal progression; the transition from "broken" to "healed" happens via a meditative action that lacks logical friction or cost. The ending offers a "happy" state change without earning it through struggle or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path (track, find, connect) with no causal turns or obstacles that force a change in tactics. The closure relies on a "happy vibes" summary ("world at peace") that dissolves tension without a legible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully realized scene, lacking resistance or meaningful obstacles. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the resolution (global change) is achieved instantly via a convenient tool ("dormant networks") without on-page cost. The closure is unearned, asserting a transformed world without dramatizing the necessary causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=1.4)
    The piece fails to form a narrative arc, functioning instead as a descriptive vignette or summary of a state of being. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or causal chain; the timeline blurs ("As the days passed") rather than grounding in a specific scene. Closure is nonexistent, as the ending (falling asleep) offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of events with no causal friction; the protagonist wants X, performs action Y, and receives X without complication. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" (a prohibited anti-pattern) where the goal is achieved perfectly with no cost or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks a complete narrative arc; it is a "ramp-up" prologue where the protagonist decides to act later rather than facing a test in the present. Causality is internal and abstract; the decision to use "proof by contradiction" happens in summary without a concrete trigger. Closure is a "false dawn" (walking away determined) with no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows an outline-like sequence of events without strong causal linkage; the "time folding" crisis appears randomly and is resolved instantly by the tether. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the antagonist (firmware) is explained away as a psychological projection, dissolving the stakes without earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear but mechanical sequence without genuine causality or pressure; the tile falls, she reads it, and peace is achieved instantly. The ending is a "soft reset" where internal conflict dissolves without a visible price or "Decisive Change." The resolution feels unearned, relying on the prompt's phrase ("meaning in the mess") rather than narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal pressure or resistance; the protagonist simply moves from point A to point B without obstacle. The closure (renaming the plaza) is a Soft Reset that asserts a change in the world ("slowly being reborn") without earning it through on-page cost or struggle. The "retrocognitive trap" functions as a flashback mechanism rather than a genuine plot complication.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" sequence where obstacles resolve through convenience ("the garden... seemed to be responding") rather than causality. The "fractured timeline" is repaired by asserted magic without a logical mechanism, resulting in an unearned "soft reset" closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative lacks genuine causality, relying on a "deus ex machina" (the static shock) to instantly resolve the protagonist's creative block without cost. The plot progression is linear and summary-heavy ("and then she succeeded"), bypassing the necessary rising action and struggle. Closure is unearned, presenting a happy ending without a paid price or meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear tour without causality; events happen sequentially ("As she walked," "As she rounded") without consequence or obstacle. Closure fails the cost test completely, offering symmetric satisfaction where the protagonist leaves exactly as she arrived, just happier.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks a causal drive; events happen sequentially but without logical necessity or escalating pressure. The connection between cataloging buttons and "unscrambling" time is purely assertive, lacking established rules or consequences. The ending is a "soft reset" where the character simply returns to work, offering no Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic (codes in snow revealing a path) that breaks causal plausibility for the genre. The ending serves as a "soft reset," resolving the character's trauma through a magical handshake without any visible cost, trade-off, or logical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of waiting and crossing with no causal turns or pressure. The ending offers a "fresh and new" soft reset without a legible cost or Decisive Change, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of observations without causal pressure or obstacles. The climax is an internal realization triggered by convenience ("inexplicable connection") rather than active struggle. Closure is a soft departure with no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a drive lens; it is a linear sequence of events ("As X happened, Y happened") without causal tension or accumulation of pressure. The ending is a "soft reset" where the sun rises and the cycle continues, lacking any Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no causal arc, inciting incident, or meaningful progression. Closure is absent, as the protagonist merely falls asleep without a decisive change, realization with cost, or reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative structure is mechanically repetitive and lacks causal friction; events happen sequentially without logical necessity or obstacle. A severe syntactic loop is present, with eight sentences beginning with "As [clause]" (e.g., "As the last wisps...", "As she sat..."), creating a droning, list-like rhythm. Closure is forced via summary rather than earned through a decisive change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=2.6)
    The plot follows a linear path of least resistance where a cosmic crisis is solved instantly by turning a dial ("magic button" resolution). The ending fails the closure requirement, offering a tidy restoration of balance with zero visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot is a linear, low-stakes progression ("and then" sequencing) where obstacles like the locked door are bypassed instantly without cost. Closure relies on an unearned "gift" ending where the protagonist passively receives a profound insight ("key... was not a physical object") instead of making a decisive change or sacrifice. The narrative lacks a functional drive lens; events happen smoothly without causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure is linear but lacks causal tension; the story proceeds as a transcript of a conversation followed by a mutual, unearned epiphany. Closure is a "realization" ending with no visible cost or sacrifice; the characters simply decide to feel better ("renewed commitment," "thaw a part of the detective's heart"). The plot is driven by convenient conversational turns rather than pressure or necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, lacking a concrete inciting incident or rising action. The ending is a "false cliffhanger" that promises a future revelation ("pointed to a revelation that would change her life forever") rather than delivering the required on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.2)
    Causality is broken by the "deus ex machina" arrival of the amnesty announcement, which lacks narrative sourcing in the mountain setting. The scaffold wrap appears conveniently to solve a puzzle without prior establishment. The ending dissolves into a "years later" summary rather than dramatizing the closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a causal plot, functioning instead as a static vignette of reflection without an inciting incident or rising action. The "realization" at the end is not a result of scene pressure but appears as a largely unearned conclusion to a walking tour.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc; the breakthrough ("understanding dawns") happens via summary without a specific trigger or cost. The ending is an "explain-everything" resolution where the problem solves itself through "renewed determination." Orientation is stable, but there is no dramatic tension or meaningful change in the protagonist's status.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and then" structure without causal pressure; events occur simply because the plot requires them (e.g., the figure "suddenly" appears). The closure is a "Soft Reset" that dissolves tension into a generic "journey continues" summary with no visible cost or specific consequence. Causality is replaced by the protagonist's attribute functioning as a device to bypass search.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causality or obstacle; Aria enters, walks, and sees, meeting no resistance. The closure is a low-stakes realization ("future was hers to shape") that feels unearned because the protagonist paid no price and overcame no difficulty to reach it. The "future arrived early" premise is disoriented, appearing as a sudden expository assertion rather than a grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist solves an internal problem with undefined magic ("weave a spell") without obstacles or reversals. While orientation is functional, the causality is weak; the resolution feels unearned because the mechanism of change is abstract and instant ("darkness within her began to recede"). The ending arrives without a "Decisive Change" born of pressure, merely a declared shift in state.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story fails the closure test; the ending is a "soft reset" where the protagonist decides to be happy without paying a visible or felt cost. The plot lacks causality, relying on a phone call that serves as a minor distraction rather than a pressure point that forces a irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist thinks about a problem and it resolves instantly. The climax relies on an &quot;explain-everything&quot; realization where the mist clears simply because Elara &quot;set to work,&quot; lacking causal friction or obstacles. The ending creates symmetric satisfaction without a felt price or meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece lacks a causal chain, inciting incident, or climax, functioning as a static vignette rather than a narrative. Closure is absent; the ending merely reiterates the opening state of peace without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on exposition to bypass the central conflict, summarizing the resolution ("The process was not a simple one") instead of showing the struggle. Causality is weak, driven by the convenient discovery of magical objects rather than character agency. The ending feels unearned, offering a tidy conclusion without a legible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc or genuine inciting incident; the protagonist merely sits, reflects, and leaves. The ending is a soft reset where the "medication" plot point is dropped without consequence, resulting in unearned resolution ("heart felt lighter") rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a frictionless linear sequence where the protagonist finds exactly what they need immediately (book, watch, door) without causal effort or setback. The ending relies on a cliché realization ("state of being") that feels disconnected from the pseudo-technical logic (propagation delays) used earlier. Causality is replaced by dream-logic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story is a static tableau with no causal arc; events occur sequentially but lack a because/therefore chain. The resolution—deciding to "act before it was too late"—is an unearned pivot that happens in thought rather than through scene dynamics. The narrative relies on "and then" progression, ending with a generic step into the unknown without resolving the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist succeeds without facing significant causal obstacles. Closure is achieved through a state change (life to death) that feels inevitable rather than earned by a difficult choice or cost paid on the page. The pacing is uniform, with no meaningful tightening of the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story lacks a causal drive or a concrete scene, operating instead as a summary of habitual actions and abstract time passing ("As the days passed," "As the seasons passed"). There is no inciting incident or rising action; the resolution (finding contentment) is a "soft reset" achieved through sudden intuition rather than struggle or cost. The narrative arc is circular and devoid of structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the conflict is solved by a magical, unexplained action ("unhooked the cloak") without cost or process. The causality is abstract; the tools (chimes, mirror) function as plot devices without established logic, leading to an "explain-everything" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear success sequence with no obstacles or causal pivots; the ending is a "mission accomplished" summary without cost, twist, or reconfiguration. While orientation is stable, the lack of pressure or meaningful turns flattens the arc into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary ("For centuries," "As the dust continued to fall") rather than a dramatized scene with causal progression. The ending offers an "explain-everything" summary of success without an earned causal chain or visible cost on the page. The vast timeframe dilutes any potential tension, reducing the plot to a chronological list of observations.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure is linear and reliant on coincidence; Eira wanders, finds a solution, and succeeds without setback or causal pressure. The ending functions as a soft reset, erasing the central conflict (stagnation) through a magical reward rather than an earned change with visible cost. The orientation is functional, but the drive lens is weak and lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is fundamentally broken; the protagonist "wanders purposefully" to "signify commitment," a beat that lacks logical connection to the outcome. The spatial logic fails: a "sunken ship" implies submersion, yet it contains "dusty tomes," a physics contradiction that breaks immersion. The ending is an unearned realization triggered by looking out a window, not by the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, obstacle-free progression (look, cook, drink, succeed) with no causal friction or stakes. The closure is a total success without cost or trade-off, rendering the "decision" trivial. Logic is driven by technobabble assertion rather than recognizable cause-and-effect, and the ending merely summarizes satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events ("As X happened, then Y happened") lacking causal tension or necessary obstacles. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist achieves peace through a ritual that costs nothing and faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a flat, linear path where a problem is identified and immediately solved without complication or cost. The resolution—fixing a "cosmic imbalance" by mending a bell—lacks causal weight or logical grounding. The ending is a "happy" stasis that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story fails to achieve closure, ending on a vague promise of future stories rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. There is no causal progression; the narrative consists of repetitive static beats where the character walks and thinks the same thoughts. The lack of an inciting incident or escalating pressure leaves the structure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate gratification without obstacles, reversals, or meaningful resistance. The closure is unearned; the protagonist succeeds on the first try without paying a visible price, resulting in a "happy stasis" ending that lacks the required decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a linear progression of work without causal setbacks or pivots; success is inevitable and lacks cost. Closure is weak ("Lyra smiled"), offering only a summary of feelings rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of the initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks causal pressure; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply decides to feel peace without paying a visible cost. The external element (history rewriting) is disconnected from the internal resolution, failing to drive the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no meaningful escalation or pressure; the mystery is introduced and immediately leveraged for success without complication. Closure fails the cost requirement, offering a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved neatly with no felt price or sacrifice. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is purely assertive; the music works because the author says so, lacking any process or complication. Orientation fails significantly as the "tunnel" and "household" are conflated into a confusing, impossible space without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative lacks causal progression, relying on a repetitive "and then" structure driven by a dream sequence ("veil of sleep") that conveniently provides all answers without cost. The resolution is unearned—whispers reveal the secrets simply because she waits—resulting in a *deus ex machina* ending. The sequencing is mechanical, often marking time rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative lacks a genuine causal arc; the climax ("In an instant, it was done") acts as a soft reset where success is granted without an on-page price or struggle. The resolution ("world was forever changed") is unearned scope creep that creates a disconnect between the small action shown and the massive result claimed. There is no legible cost to the alchemist.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot follows a strictly linear "and-then" sequence (finds object, clears mind, finds room, understands) with no causality or reversals. Closure is a soft reset—a convenient realization without any visible, felt, or conceptual cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with weak causality; the protagonist solves the central mystery instantly via unexplained knowledge. The ending is a generic "step into the unknown" without a legible cost or decisive change in the character's defined reality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without causal pressure; the protagonist’s actions lead immediately to success without complication or risk. The closure is a form of symmetric satisfaction where the character gains everything ("unlocked a secret," "texture of connection") without paying any visible price. The ending explains the resolution rather than showing a reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative is a linear summary of a successful lesson without a causal arc, inciting incident, or rising action. Closure is nonexistent; the story ends with a generic affirmation of the future, lacking the required decisive change, reconfiguration, or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "Soft Reset" anti-pattern where complex grief vanishes instantly upon receiving a platitude, rendering the resolution unearned. The story stops frequently for expository lumps ("Aria's role was...", "Her method was...") that explain the plot rather than dramatizing the inciting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot advances through convenience, with the protagonist finding a logbook that explains the exact escape method required just in time. The mechanics of the "gold fleck" lock are muddled—it is introduced as a lock requirement, found in margins, then seemingly ignored as she enters the room effortlessly. Closure is achieved through unearned "techno-magic" (traveling through cables) that resolves the crisis without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is broken by a "magic system" failure where physical ink arbitrarily decodes a "digital ghost" without established logic. The narrative progresses through "and then" sequencing rather than consequence, relying on convenient occurrences (static clearing, ghost coalescing) to reach an unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks causality or resistance; the "curse" resolves automatically into a blessing without agentive effort, creating a soft reset. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction without a felt price, failing to earn its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path (arrive, receive item, listen, leave) but lacks causal tension or a decisive turn; the ending is a "Soft Reset" where the protagonist simply feels ready to face the world. The "metamorphosis" is purely internal and abstract, lacking a visible cost or reconfiguration of options. The "missing return changed" is inserted as backstory exposition that explains nothing and fails to pressure the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or cost. The closure—a "happy ending" where the mechanical world is defeated by a song—lacks the required "Decisive Change" with visible cost, resulting in a low-stakes summary rather than a dramatized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: receive, walk, deliver, return. The central obstacle (drones) is resolved by a convenient "stray signal" rather than the protagonist's skill or the specific "linking absences" method mentioned. Closure relies on stated satisfaction rather than a visible cost or consequence paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure is a linear "and-then" sequence (hears song, walks, sees singer, returns) devoid of causal pressure or necessary reversals. Closure relies on an unearned "soft reset" ("newfound sense of purpose") and summary explanation rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The appearance of an oasis inside or near a train track lacks the necessary spatial or magical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unobstructed success, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change with visible cost. The ending offers a "mission accomplished" stasis without price or trade-off. Causality is mechanical (draw curves -> magic happens) rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=2.2)
    The piece fails to establish a scene, relying on a generalized summary of a routine without a singular narrative present. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive closure; the ending merely loops back to the status quo without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist faces no genuine resistance; the "thickening air" is a token obstacle that requires no tactical change. The closure is a soft reset—the task is completed exactly as intended without unforeseen consequences or a "before/after" state change for the locksmith. Causality is weak, relying on a convenient prophecy ("ancient tradition") rather than character agency driving the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a prologue or summary rather than a dramatized scene, lacking a decisive change or paid cost. The use of a "decades later" flash-forward deflates present tension by assuring the reader of long-term success without earning it in the moment. The ending ("the journey... had begun") is a setup rather than a resolution, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist succeeds without cost or complication. The "magic" of the tea leaves functions as a convenient plot device that solves the problem immediately upon inspection. Closure is a "mission accomplished" soft reset that lacks the required decisive change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a drive lens; it is a linear sequence of successes with no obstacles or causal friction. Closure fails the rubric's cost requirement entirely—the resolution is a "happily ever after" with no price paid, physical or emotional. The plot is a series of "and then" statements without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path with no meaningful tightening or causal turns; the net is untangled simply because the author wills it. The inciting incident and climax are barely distinguishable from the ongoing process, and the mask/net discrepancy undermines the story's internal logic. Closure is achieved through task completion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a summary of a process rather than a dramatized scene. Causality breaks when "silent video footage" inexplicably reveals auditory "whispers," and the closure (finding peace) is unearned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=2.3)
    Physical causality is fundamentally broken; the narrator smells salt and sees "dusty tomes" inside a submerged wreck populated by fish, ignoring the physics of water. The plot advances through magical convenience—untangling a random fishing net reveals a coherent text message via knots—rather than logical cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes sequence ("began to ponder," "started to encode," "finished") without a Causal Drive Lens creating necessary linkages or pressure. Closure is asserted via summary ("uncovered a hidden truth about herself") rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or paid cost on the page. The story functions as a vignette of guaranteed success rather than a plot with turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summarizing off-page events (finding the diary) while the protagonist waits in an elevator, stalling momentum. The ending offers unearned stasis—she simply leaves the room smiling—lacking a Decisive Change or any visible cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal chain; the "storm" has already passed, removing urgency. The ending relies on a "soft reset" (peace settles) without an earned Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Events occur sequentially but without "because/therefore" linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience; the pivotal discovery of the book safe occurs by random chance ("fingers brushed against"), breaking causal tension. The closure is weak, relying on an asserted "otherworldly light" rather than a dramatized change or paid cost, resulting in a low-stakes linear sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality breaks at the central puzzle; the connection between floor scuff marks and a wall chart is geometrically implausible and reads as "magical convenience." The narrative lacks meaningful pressure or a decisive turning point, resulting in a soft closure ("ready to set course") where no cost is paid and no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with convenient causality; the necessary book and door appear exactly when needed without search or cost. Closure is a soft epiphany ("felt a deep connection") that lacks a decisive change or paid price. The progression feels inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a realized story, lacking a specific scene anchor (Who, Where, When) to ground the reader. The plot moves effortlessly from problem to solution without causality, resistance, or cost, failing to provide a valid closure unit. The "Orientation Test" failure (−0.5) applies due to the absence of a concrete timeframe or immediate setting.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist faces a task and succeeds without complication or cost. There is no inciting incident that disrupts the status quo, nor a climax that tests the protagonist's capacity; the ending is a foregone conclusion from the first paragraph. The "hush" provides a static atmosphere rather than a causal drive, resulting in a scene that feels like a tableau rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where obstacles are overcome immediately upon being encountered. The inciting incident (the nut) and the resolution (travelers arriving exactly when the labyrinth opens) rely heavily on convenience and coincidence rather than causal pressure. The ending lacks a decisive change with felt cost, resolving into an "explain-everything" happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative structure relies entirely on a repetitive "As [action], [result]" syntax that flattens causality into a list of simultaneous occurrences. The closure—a sudden epiphany linking river foam to polymers—feels unearned by the preceding scene work and lacks a visible cost or tradeoff. The story tells the reader the pieces fell into place rather than showing the struggle of fitting them together.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causal tension; events happen sequentially ("then she remembered," "then she decided") rather than consequentially. The ending is a classic "symmetric satisfaction" failure where the protagonist gains profound wisdom and comfort without paying any visible or felt price. The realization feels unearned by the low-stakes action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with little causal density; the transition "At the close of an unspoken dream" is disorienting and disconnects the kitchen scene from the dunes. Closure is a "soft reset" where the conflict evaporates upon contact with the pavilion, lacking a Decisive Change or Reconfiguration that requires sacrifice. The plot relies on Elara walking to a location and touching an object to resolve the central tension instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking causal friction; the protagonist climbs, speaks, and succeeds without obstacle. Closure is unearned, relying on a magical conversation that resolves complex industrial-history tensions instantly, with no visible price paid for the result.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path with no causal resistance or setbacks; Elara simply wills the repair into existence. The ending lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, resolving instead into an unearned success state where all secrets are unlocked without price. The plot feels like an outline of events rather than a causally linked chain of consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience; gravity inverts exactly when the protagonist needs it, and the doodle's meaning is realized instantly without deduction. The closure is purely additive (she gets the book) with zero visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" sequence with no causal setbacks or meaningful obstacles; the protagonist finds the solution immediately and succeeds without cost. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved perfectly, lacking the required closure cost or resonant reconfiguration. The "stress cracks" analysis suggests complexity that is never dramatized in the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of time passing ("As twilight descended," "As he sat," "As the stars") without causal linkage or rising stakes. Closure is a "soft reset" where the character simply decides to be hopeful without paying a price or enduring a transformative event. The lack of an inciting incident leaves the story drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story fails to establish a Causal or Situational drive; the protagonist overcomes the sole obstacle (the lock) via an unexplained magical convenience ("tuning frequencies") with no cost. The ending lacks the required closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost), resulting in a consequence-free, unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a dramatized story, spanning years and summarizing a lifetime instead of focusing on a singular, high-stakes crisis. Causality is weak, relying on arbitrary magical timing ("tide's thought turned") to resolve the plot without protagonist agency or cost. The ending violates the closure requirement by offering a summary of future fame rather than a specific, costly change in stance or circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear tour without obstacle or reversal; the gravity inversion aids rather than hinders the protagonist. Closure is a weak realization ("source... was the gathering of echoes") that creates no visible or felt cost, functioning as an "explain-everything" ending that lacks narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative lacks a genuine causal chain; the epiphany regarding the crash is asserted via summary ("pieced together a narrative") rather than dramatized through specific evidence. Closure fails the cost requirement, offering a low-stakes exit that restates determination without a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative operates as a linear ritual description rather than a story with causality; the sequence proceeds from intent to success without complication or cost. Closure is achieved through a summary of success ("she had succeeded") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that alters the protagonist's state or options.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path without causal resistance; the protagonist wants to play the flute, plays it, and receives a transformation without obstacle or cost. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved exactly as intended, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that asserts change rather than demonstrating it. Orientation is clear, but the lack of a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" with visible price flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: Echo wants to print, sets up the machine, and succeeds without complication. The "vanishing stars" establish a clock, but this pressure does not force a change in tactics or a meaningful trade-off; the causal link between the printing and the cosmic event remains vague. Closure is weak, relying on an "explain-everything" internal summary of success rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the story's world or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or coherent arc; it is a linear sequence of pleasant events with no obstacle or reversal. Closure is nonexistent, as the character begins and ends in the same emotional state without paying a price or making a decisive change. The "As [event]" structure replaces genuine causality with temporal coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative lacks causality, functioning as a static vignette rather than a story; the protagonist simply looks and succeeds without obstacle. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive change, and the "closure" is merely a declared state of emotional unity without narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is weak; the discovery of a "rummage sale box" in a "forgotten" ancient forest creates a jarring logic break that disrupts immersion. The resolution—solving a relationship rift by completing a jigsaw puzzle—feels unearned and symbolic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural structure without causal turns or complications. The ending (apprentice arrival) serves as a setup for a future story rather than a resolution to the current scene, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The climax relies on a "withheld truth" that is never revealed to the reader, creating a vacuum where the resolution should be. This "false complexity" fails to provide legible closure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative suffers from a severe causality break: the inciting incident (the lamp flickering out) establishes a high-stakes crisis that the protagonist ignores to perform a low-stakes meditative ritual. The closure—a feeling of safety and resolve—is unearned because the external threat (the dark tower) remains unresolved and unaddressed. The sequence of events (waits, finds item, leaves, stacks stones) lacks "because/therefore" linkage, resulting in a hollow episodic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (ascent, adjustment, sunrise) rather than a causal plot. Closure is unearned; the dawn arrives as a natural inevitability, not a result of the character’s struggle or sacrifice. The connection between the "Accidentally prophetic" nature and the ritual is asserted but not demonstrated through narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal tightening or a decisive change; the ending is a "soft reset" of satisfaction. The structure lacks a "felt or conceptual cost" required for genuine closure, relying instead on a summarized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where magic conveniently fixes the problem without logical causality or price. The climax is triggered by an arbitrary coincidence (the pin drop) rather than protagonist action, and the story lacks a coherent causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot relies on a "magic fix" structure where a significant problem (a dying realm) is resolved instantly by a single action (humming) without complication or cost. This fails the closure requirement for a Decisive Change with visible price; the resolution is unearned and lacks causal friction. The narrative moves linearly from arrival to success without a turning point that tests the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "explain-everything" structure where a specific book is found conveniently to resolve the central anxiety without obstacle. The resolution is a "soft reset" that clears emotional stakes without cost; causality is driven by the author's hand rather than character agency. The inciting incident (invitation) and resolution (writing) are connected only by abstract musing, not causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative dissolves from a scene into a summary montage ("As the days shortened"), violating the short-story scope defaults without earning the transition. Closure is a "soft reset" of stated gratitude that lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or any legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events with no causal pressure or turning points. Closure fails the rubric’s requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost; the ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist simply succeeds and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story suffers from a complete failure of closure; the climax is a static staring contest that resolves via the sunrise (external event) rather than protagonist agency. The ending ("fragile sense of understanding") is a soft reset that dissipates tension without cost or consequence. The narrative drive is Causal initially but dissolves into aimless summary.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is linear and episodic, following a simple "and then" progression driven by the prop (the ring) rather than protagonist agency. The closure offers a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the character gets exactly what she wants (understanding/peace) with zero visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative suffers from a "magic feather" resolution where the physical lock transforms without established causal logic, breaking the story's reality. The ending offers a convenient reset of the conflict (blockage gone, lock fixed) without any felt sacrifice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=2.4)
    The piece fails the scope requirement, functioning as a synopsis of a longer timeline ("One day," "Eventually," "returned") rather than a dramatized scene. Closure is unearned, relying on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the character gains wisdom without paying a visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.3)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" sequencing with a weak inciting incident ("One day...") and an unearned resolution. The transition to a world without words is asserted conceptually rather than dramatized through causality or cost; the ending feels like a summary rather than a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is fundamentally broken; the "inciting incident" (magnetic north shift) has no logical connection to the events, and the climax involves the protagonist resolving her internal "static" simply by doing her routine job. The narrative asserts a "break free" moment that is not supported by the compliant actions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative is a synopsis spanning weeks rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope requirements for short fiction. Causality is summarized ("leads... pointed to a surprising connection") rather than experienced, and the ending is a tidy, unearned summary of communal happiness with no visible cost or decisive change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality collapses at the ending; the protagonist escapes an "underwater tomb" by simply pushing open a door into sunlight, ignoring the established physical constraints of the setting. The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing where the act of journaling leads to physical liberation without a logical mechanism or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure reads like a synopsis or an outline, relying on "and then" sequencing where events occur without logical causality (e.g., the leap from gravity shifts to reading coffee grounds in a salt chamber). The closure is a "magic gift" resolution where the central problem is solved by touching a crystal, lacking any visible or felt cost. The pacing is summary-heavy, bypassing the dramatization of the journey and the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with a "magic button" resolution; the prophecy is hushed simply because the summoner meditates, with no causal complexity or obstacle. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect, cost-free fix—which fails the requirement for a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal pressure or meaningful obstacles; the lesson proceeds smoothly to a success state without risk. The closure is asserted through summary ("never see the world in the same way again") rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice or visible cost. The inciting incident (sugar borrowing) is relegated to backstory summary, weakening the present momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear summary of a transformation rather than a causal sequence of events; obstacles are nonexistent, as the seashell simply solves the protagonist's problem. The closure is a "soft reset"—a sudden flood of positive memory cures her isolation without any visible cost, trade-off, or meaningful tightening of options. The drive lens is ambiguous because the progression is purely additive and lacks a decisive turning point or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=2.7)
    The plot relies on chronological progression ("As the night wore on") rather than causality, lacking any meaningful turns or obstacles. The resolution is achieved through a magical prop ("key with no apparent lock") rather than character agency or process.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or mythic summary rather than a dramatized scene, lacking a concrete inciting incident or rising action. Closure is weak ("taken a step closer"), representing a pause in a continuous state rather than a decisive change or paid cost that reconfigures the character’s world.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear dream-logic without causal friction; events happen sequentially (touch globe, see vision, understanding dawns) rather than through earned effort. The closure—opening the "windows of connection"—feels like a soft reset achieved by tracing a pattern, lacking visible cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of movement without causal pressure or obstacles; the "Drive Lens" is absent as events happen sequentially without friction. Closure is a "soft reset" where an abstract epiphany is asserted ("she knew she had finally grasped the truth") rather than earned through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot hinges on a massive convenience: finding legible shredded paper in a "ravaged" landscape and reassembling it during a dust storm before sunset. The narrative structure is a linear fetch-quest without reversals; the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics. Closure is a generic arrival ("she knew that she had found") without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a synopsis spanning years rather than a dramatized scene, violating scope requirements. There is no scene-level causality; events progress through vague "and then" summation without an on-page climax, resistance, or a valid closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is a passive sequence of events ("As he did X, he felt Y") rather than a causal chain of choices. The ending is a "soft reset" where the conflict (existential dread) is resolved instantly by a memory, offering symmetric satisfaction without narrative cost. The "As..." temporal loop dominates the transitions, killing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with no complications, reversals, or meaningful cost. The protagonist enters, performs the task successfully without resistance, and leaves; this lacks the required closure unit (Decisive Change/RR/CR) as the "before" and "after" states are identical regarding risk or knowledge. The ending is a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot lacks causality and meaningful closure; the resolution is a "magic hands" moment where raising arms arbitrarily solves the problem without cost or mechanical logic. The narrative is a linear progression of "she waited, then she acted, then she won," void of setbacks or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative lacks a functional drive lens; the investigation is resolved via summary ("Through empirical observation") rather than scene. The ending is a "soft reset" where the protagonist declares herself healed without paying any on-page cost or facing a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure path: entry, observation, lecture, epiphany, exit. There is no causality or cost; the protagonist's problem is solved by a single conversation without any obstacle or genuine turning point, resulting in a soft reset rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a synopsis rather than a fully realized story, lacking distinct scenes, dialogue, or beat-by-beat causality. The closure is a declared event ("rang the bell") without visible cost, resistance, or earned setup on the page. The "and-then" sequencing fails to build narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a dramatized story, lacking a specific scene, anchor, or immediate inciting incident. The resolution—that files were merely archived—dissolves the conflict without cost or logical setup, rendering the prior tension moot.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot is linear and lacks causality born of pressure; the protagonist finds a problem and immediately solves it with a convenient magical method (mirrors) that offers no resistance. The closure is a "soft reset" where the balance is restored without any visible cost or sacrifice. The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing rather than "because/therefore" escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story violates the short-story scope by summarizing days of activity ("As the days passed") rather than dramatizing a specific, pressure-filled scene. Causality is absent; the character heals simply because time passes and they perform labor, but the reader witnesses no specific obstacle or turning point. Closure is asserted ("I was at peace") rather than earned through a dramatized event or realization.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no inciting incident, rising action, or causal chain; events happen sequentially but without consequence. Closure is nonexistent (a zero-cost affirmation that she will return), failing to provide a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The piece relies on a loop of reflection that ends exactly where it began.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of guaranteed success with no causal complication or cost. The structure is a procedural enactment rather than a story; the "turmoil" mentioned in the setup vanishes without influencing the outcome or exacting a price. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction that resolves nothing because nothing was truly at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear "and then" sequence with no causal friction or turning point. Closure is nonexistent; the protagonist leaves the scene in the same emotional state she arrived in, with no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot suffers from a lack of causal friction; the inciting incident (the summons) leads immediately to resolution without a testing phase or meaningful struggle. The ending relies on unearned optimism ("world... ready to listen") that contradicts the established atmosphere of decay, resulting in a low-cost, convenient closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: desire, action, success, satisfaction. There is no obstacle or causal complication; the ritual simply works. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist achieves her goal with no meaningful cost or reconfiguration of stakes, resulting in unearned symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary ("Eli's days were spent," "He worked tirelessly") rather than dramatized scenes, preventing engagement with the inciting incident or climax. The resolution is a thematic assertion rather than a consequence of specific cause-and-effect actions.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal tension; the goal is achieved without obstacle or cost. The setting creates significant orientation confusion by mixing medical realism ("blood work") with a vague metaphysical backdrop ("haven above the clouds").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("The night wore on," "As the days passed") rather than dramatized causal beats within a scene. The ending dissolves into a promise of future action ("journey ahead") rather than a decisive change with paid cost in the present. The "epiphany" is stated as a result of off-page thinking rather than shown through a specific causal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a drive lens, drifting from a discovery to a summary of future success without a scene-level climax or consequence. The ending violates closure requirements by dissolving into a generalized forecast ("seasons passed") rather than resolving the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking causality, reversals, or a decisive change; the ending merely reiterates the opening state without cost. There is no structural tension, and the "journey" is purely abstract, failing to meet the closure requirement of a visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=2.7)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where a stranger's gesture instantly resolves deep trauma without cost or protagonist agency. Causality is weak; the transition from "exposed and vulnerable" to "healed" is unearned by the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.2)
    Causality is non-existent; the central conflict is resolved by a magical apparition rather than protagonist action, constituting a "soft reset" with no cost. The "feral nexus" is never grounded, leading to significant orientation debt, and the ending fails to provide the required closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unhindered success with no "try-fail" cycles or meaningful obstacles. The closure fails the literary requirement for cost; the resolution is purely positive, lacking the trade-off or sacrifice needed to give the ending weight. The climax ("when everything aligns") occurs through narrative convenience rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a successful magic trick with no deviation, meaningful obstacle, or cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—she intended to succeed and did—lacking the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that alters the status quo or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story violates the scene-based scope by summarizing a months-long process ("days turned into weeks") which dissipates all narrative tension. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—he fixes the clock and leaves happy—lacking any decisive change, reconfigured meaning, or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedure (enter, weave, leave) without causal turns or rising pressure. The ending relies on summary ("legend grew") and a return to the status quo rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The sequence is episodic and lacks the "because/therefore" linkages required for narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear list of actions without a causal turn, resistance, or cost; the shift from grief to peace is asserted in summary rather than dramatized. The closure relies on a stated emotion ("peace") that does not feel earned by the prior low-stakes activity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot follows a linear accumulative path with no significant causal complications or pressure. Closure is achieved through narrative assertion ("found a measure of peace") rather than being earned by the scene's events. The ending relies on a symbolic act that feels disconnected from a concrete causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is magical; complex engineering problems are solved instantly by "rerouting pipes" and using a sextant as a mystic guide. The narrative relies on summary montage ("As the hours passed") to skip the actual struggle. Closure is purely additive with zero on-page cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal obstacles; the bear acts as a convenient catalyst that instantly resolves the protagonist's life direction without complication. Closure is a "soft reset" where a major life change is decided without any visible cost or consequence on the page. The ending explains the resolution rather than earning it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure path: arrival, immediate discovery, and epiphany, with no obstacles or reversals. The closure is a "gift" ending where the object and insight are handed to the protagonist without an earned decisive change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal friction or a Decisive Change. The protagonist arrives, succeeds immediately at her task without distinct tactics, and leaves; the ending is a "Soft Reset" where nothing has fundamentally changed or cost anything. The "secret" is abstract and convenient, lacking narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes sequence (walk, find thread, write, feel better) that lacks causal tension. The resolution is an internal "realization" that arrives without visible cost or complication; the climax involves merely writing down words, which solves the abstract problem instantly. The snapping of the thread is a symbolic convenience rather than a decisive change driven by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on a &quot;soft reset&quot; ending where a device fixes the world without cost or consequence. Causality is broken by the sudden appearance of &quot;fragments of a long-forgotten device&quot; that were not established in the setting earlier (deus ex machina). The resolution is a symmetric satisfaction ending that feels mechanical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal chain; a firefighter responding to an emergency call who stops to perform horticulture on a single tree strains suspension of disbelief. There is no obstacle or rising action, and the story resolves in a state of unearned stasis identical to the opening. The closure brings no change in knowledge, status, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless "and-then" structure where the protagonist simply walks until she finds the objective. The ending relies on a "magic fix" where opening the box resolves the city's stasis without requiring a decisive change or sacrifice from the character, resulting in low causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a linear transit without a causal arc, inciting incident, or climax. Events happen sequentially ("wandered," "strolled," "vanished") but lack consequence or cost. The ending offers no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, merely a fade-out.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure is sequential ("and then") rather than causal, lacking a decisive turning point or earned consequence. The closure—a realization about "collective grief"—feels unearned because the story skips the struggle required to reach it, resulting in a soft, low-impact ending.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on a severe causality break: the central conflict is resolved by finding a rake handle with explicit therapeutic advice carved into it (Deus Ex Machina). There is no agency or cost; the protagonist simply finds the solution on the ground. Closure is unearned, offering a "happy ending" without the requisite struggle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes "and then" progression with no causal friction. The resolution—untangling a thread leads to cosmic understanding—is an unearned "magic key" solution that bypasses logical development. The ending offers no decisive change or cost, merely a stated realization of abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative is a static vignette of mental visualization rather than a story with causality; no decisive change or cost occurs on the page. The ending loops back to the initial state (pen hovering) without advancing the character's situation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails the closure requirement, ending on a zero-cost success ("she had succeeded") that does not reweight the stakes. A pivotal beat introducing a "presence" behind her is completely abandoned after she dons a cloak, creating a severe causal break where a threat vanishes without interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative is static, lacking causal drive or escalation; the opening image (rocking chair) creates immediate orientation debt as it disconnects spatially from the gallery standing position. Closure relies on a stated "newfound appreciation" rather than a dramatized change or paid price. The premise of scattering art ashes is asserted but not grounded in a logical cause-and-effect framework.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc or genuine pressure; Kael begins by rejecting the official narrative and ends by reaffirming that rejection, resulting in a static vignette with no decisive change or cost. The scene is a summary of thoughts rather than an unfolding event, failing to ground the reader in a specific moment of crisis or discovery. Closure is weak, relying on a "looking forward" trope that implies future action rather than resolving the current beat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story is a static vignette with no narrative drive, inciting incident, or causal chain. The structure relies on a sequence of observations and thoughts ("She sat," "She thought," "She played," "She packed up") rather than pressure or consequence. Closure is absent; the ending is a summarizing generalization that requires no change from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of success with no obstacles, reversals, or meaningful cost. The resolution relies on a "magic win" (the seed sprouting instantly due to the alignment) rather than a result earned through character agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a story, lacking scene-level causality or resistance. The plot advances through convenient coincidences (maintenance workers arriving at the exact moment) and resolves via an exposition dump (finding a logbook) rather than active investigation. Closure is weak, offering a thematic platitude without a decisive change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot is a linear, friction-free sequence: see shop, buy item, use item, have epiphany. There is no causality that requires a difficult choice, and the closure is an unearned assertion of "profound discovery" rather than a dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal tension; the climax relies on a coincidence (the ampoule) and an abstract, undramatized realization ("cascade of revelations"). The resolution is unearned, as the garden's transformation occurs via magical summary without visible effort or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a repetitive loop of climbing and thinking without a causal arc or decisive turn; the "rupture" is stated but effects no change in the scene. Closure is merely a cessation of the text while the action continues unchanged ("I continued my ascent"), lacking a resonant reconfiguration or paid cost. Orientation is vague, relying on the generic concept of "infinite" rather than concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks a valid closure unit; the ending is a symmetric satisfaction where the protagonist simply resolves to continue her work without paying a price. Causality is loose and associative, lacking the pressure required to force a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The "orientation" is clear, but the drive leads to no structural tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot is a linear tour with no causal drive; events happen to the characters (the ice thaws spontaneously) rather than resulting from agency. The ending is a summary of abstract feelings ("sense of purpose") rather than a dramatic closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is broken by arbitrary logic leaps; the protagonist inexplicably knows he must solve a specific yoyo puzzle to use the stone. The climax is handled in summary ("piecing together the fragments") rather than dramatized scene work. The ending offers no cost or meaningful reconfiguration, only a declared transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=2.7)
    The story relies on a linear tour-guide structure with weak causality, culminating in a "blackout" ending ("everything went black") that avoids on-page resolution. This "soft reset" prevents any demonstrated cost or decisive change, relying instead on a summary of feeling "changed" after waking.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=2.2)
    The piece is a static vignette rather than a story, lacking an inciting incident, rising action, or a closure unit with cost. The ending—a sudden vanishing—is a "fade to black" that avoids resolution or consequence, failing the closure requirement completely.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot moves linearly, but the inciting incident relies on convenience; finding the specific shell that opens immediately upon inspection lacks earned causality. The closure (leaving the city) is a Decisive Change, but the transition from cartographer to explorer feels rushed and mechanically driven by the map token.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where obstacles are overcome via summary ("task was not an easy one"). Closure is technically a victory but lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, reading as an unearned "happy ending" driven by weak causality.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc or genuine inciting incident, unfolding as a linear sequence of observations and passive reflections. The closure—leaving the inkwell behind—feels arbitrary and carries no visible cost or consequence, failing to reconfigure the stakes or meaning. The structure is essentially a vignette without the requisite pressure or turning point for a complete story.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.4)
    Significant logic failures undermine causality. Elara reads and deciphers complex codes in a "blackout" after the "last remnants of sunlight faded," with no mention of a lantern or flashlight. The resolution is unearned; she solves the cipher instantly with "knowledge of cryptography" without struggle or process.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a static vignette with almost no causal progression; the protagonist sits, thinks, and releases a paper crane. The ending operates as a soft reset ("found a measure of peace") without an earned cost or a decisive change in the character's status or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=2.1)
    Causality is weak; the protagonist finds a flyer for a floating observatory in fresh wreckage, which serves as an unmotivated bridge to the next scene. The narrative relies on "and then" progression with no resistance or complication; the discovery of the "catalyst" is instant and unearned. Closure is a generic promise of future action ("journey was just beginning") rather than a resolution of the scene's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a "tourist mode" structure with no causal friction; obstacles are resolved immediately via summary ("using her knowledge of astronomy"). The closure provides symmetric satisfaction ("mission accomplished") without a visible cost, trade-off, or meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's status or worldview. Causality is soft, relying on convenient finds rather than earned discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative suffers from a lack of causality; the resolution hinges on a coincidence where picking up a random piece of driftwood triggers a convenient magical vision. The story halts momentum to explicitly define terms ("sieved hush") in an expository lump, breaking immersion. Orientation is static, and the decision to "uncover the truth" is a declared intention rather than a consequence of pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story lacks a causal drive; the resolution is unearned, relying on a summary speech to instantly fix entrenched conflict ("weaving a spell of calm"). There is no inciting incident or rising action on the page, only a static situation that resolves via convenient agreement, rendering the closure unimpactful.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure without causal pressure or meaningful obstacles. The ending is a "soft reset" where a simple paddle resolves the trauma of divorce without visible cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: walk, find object, feel better. There is no Causal or Situational pressure forcing a turn; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply decides she is healed without paying a visible cost. The ending explains the change rather than dramatizing it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story functions as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, relying on the convenient coincidence of the traveler possessing the exact spices required. Closure is an abstract "expansion" that claims transformation without exacting a visible or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies on passive "and then" sequencing where the protagonist observes objects until an unearned epiphany occurs without causal pressure. The resolution is asserted through abstract summary ("understanding begin to dawn") rather than demonstrated through decisive action or visible cost. The logic of the ending ("vanishing") feels disconnected from the established goal of recovering time.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression with no causal friction or earned turning points. The resolution (opening the dimension) is achieved through "practiced ease" rather than struggle, resulting in closure that lacks a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on the anti-pattern of the universe "orchestrating coincidences" to advance the plot, removing all causal agency from the character. The closure is a soft reset—she receives a magical object and feels better—without any Decisive Change or felt cost. The prophecy device is a convenient mechanism to force significance onto random events.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is strained by the mechanics of using a sundial to cast complex coded shadows in "inky darkness" or faint moonlight. The resolution is unearned, as a single button press instantly sparks a successful societal revolution without obstacle or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: the herder looks for dust, finds it immediately, performs a ritual without complication, and succeeds. There is no meaningful obstacle or reversal to test the protagonist's goal. The ending offers a "vision" of success without a visible or felt cost, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative structure is a static vignette with a weak resolution mechanism—reading a letter whose contents are withheld from the reader creates a "tell, don't show" ending. The causal chain is nonexistent; the transition from turmoil to peace is unearned and lacks a visible cost. The story functions as a summary of an epiphany rather than the experience of one.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on "magic logic" where staring at a sundial allows the protagonist to win a physical sword fight. The climax is summarized rather than dramatized ("moved with a speed and precision"), and the closure relies on a cliché realization ("victory lay... in the journey") that negates the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative suffers from a catastrophic causality break where a single character restores a derelict building overnight ("beauty emerging like a phoenix") without tools or labor time. The story operates in summary mode rather than scene, bypassing all obstacles to arrive at an unearned resolution. Closure is achieved through "magic realism" logic that contradicts the gritty setup.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates on dream logic with weak causality; the screen appears "out of nowhere," and the protagonist leaves the film world simply because the horizon changes, not due to pressure. The ending is a "soft reset" where the character suddenly decides to be happy without an earned on-page cost or decisive change, dissolving the conflict conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary ("As the days passed," "Through the dreams of a young girl") rather than dramatized scenes. There is no inciting incident on the page, merely a chronological list of tasks performed without obstacle. The closure (vanishing into the mist) feels mechanically imposed rather than earned by prior struggle or causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure with weak causality; Kaito finds a compass and immediately decides to make lace on a rock, a non-sequitur progression. The closure relies on a "soft reset" where the protagonist performs a ritual and is instantly healed, lacking visible cost or logical groundwork. The inciting incident and resolution feel mechanically staged to satisfy requirements rather than organically derived.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of whispers/memories tightening to RR closure in final dawn image ("seashell still in hand"); orientation anchored early in garden/twilight; one meaningful deepening when whispers "grew louder" pulling her into memories pays off with felt cost of painful recollections.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density builds to Charged Poise closure in final steps back/pride, reconfiguring task with felt peace cost. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/aurora. Thin causality—no meaningful tightening narrows options; process unfolds without reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through images to Charged Poise closure in final clearing realization with felt unity cost. Orientation anchored early on parapet. Minimal tightening; and-then sequencing lacks motivated ellipsis narrowing options.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from crafting to basilica longing and crane release as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring grief with felt emotional cost in "grief begin to unfold, like the petals of a lotus."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid Accumulative/Causal lens holds: Aria's arrival because fortune/spices leads to ritual therefore transformation; one tightening in essence shaping narrows to merge. Closure as RR (Charged Poise in expansion with "terrifying" cost legible in final image). Orientation anchored early; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through symbolic objects to a legible Conceptual Repricing (CR) closure—"lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories"—with felt conceptual cost in fractured acceptance; orientation anchors early, single scene fits scope, but lacks one crisp pattern break for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) but the conceptual cost is asserted, not dramatized: “she felt a sense of kindled humility” tells the shift rather than showing it sting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust motes reweight meaning—but the pattern is declared repeatedly instead of discovered through a single tightening beat. Orientation is early and clear; no teleporting props. Causality is loose: the storm is past, the dust is found, and the insight is purely reflective; no option narrows or price is paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, ledger, and scorched testament layer into a Charged Poise closure. Anchor clear by word 30. No decisive change on-page; final stance is epiphanic narration rather than visible renunciation. Closure cost is atmospheric, not concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: sunrise light-shift + heat-map color bloom tighten the stake of “translating silence” into felt vibration. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dimming lights and leaning plants re-weight their symphony as a living part of the conservatory. Cost is conceptual—the music must now be carried alone—but not visibly paid on the page, keeping it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clear—package → descent → lens → signal → sanctuary—but the decisive change (his “rest” achieved) is asserted off-page in the epilogue-style coda, so the cost is felt only faintly. The lens reassembly is the tightest beat; the years-later plateau softens the closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a declared rallying cry (“We will not be broken…”) rather than a visible decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the cost is rhetorical, not on-page. The piece is accumulative/textural, but the final cadence merely restates earlier sentiment without tightening or deepening. No option is foreclosed, no tactic altered.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—each breath adds luminescence to the wisteria and the stored love—then crystallizes in the final charged poise where blossoms “whisper a gentle benediction.” The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by word 40, well within the 120-word allowance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aria’s stance toward her stored love is visibly reweighted (“no longer a source of pain”), the cost is the pilgrim’s disappearance and the irrevocable opening of her heart.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: each paragraph adds lush sensory layer until the halo reconstitutes the photograph and reweights Elian’s perception of time. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elian stands “poised on the threshold” with new knowledge—yet the cost is only asserted (“metaphysical odyssey that would forever change”). Causality is loose: the fragment glows because Elian touches it, but no prior beat sets up why this moment or why Elian is qualified; the link is lyrical, not motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causal chain is legible: wall falls → finder reaches carnival → piano clue → vault → distribution, each link contingent on the last. However, the vault breach and seed hand-off are compressed into summary; the decisive moment happens off-stage, softening cost. Time anchors and geography remain generic—no city name, season, or spatial layout to ground reader orientation. Closure is a pastoral montage rather than a single beat where options narrow or reprice; the lens holds but the tightening is narrated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (color-whispers, forge murmur, shipwreck ribs) deepens the same stake—can silence wound and heal?—until the cadence shift of the glass-shatter sound lands as Conceptual Repricing. Anchors (who/where/when) are vivid by line 3, well under the 120-word caution. Closure beat (“she imprinted it… device hummed to life”) shows visible cost: the fragile crystalline note now exists outside her, a tool that will replay trauma for others—an irreversible ethical trade-off. The only minor waiver: “trust breaking” is named more than dramatized, so the conceptual cost is felt more than socially tested.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Lumina walking away re-weights the premise that destiny is collectible. Cost is conceptual rather than felt—no opportunity forfeited, no path foreclosed on the page. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (moonbeam jar, flower code) and pays off in the last glow, yet the tightening is gentle, not decisive. Causality is loose: because Lumina sees the jar, therefore they feel destiny is nearer—no tactical change narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the orb glows, Elian smiles, “never be alone again” – uplift without concrete cost or before/after shift. Accumulative lens holds: motif layering (ice, orb, bookmark) re-weights the stake from isolation to creative mission, but the cost is emotional assertion rather than dramatized forfeiture. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the thaw is ambient, not driven by Elian’s agency. Pattern is taught early and coherent, so no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure image—walking out of the library into “brighter future”—is a soft reset that clears rather than reweights stakes; no concrete object, relationship, or opportunity is visibly foregone. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the seashell hum and decoded note deepen mood rather than alter causal options; the final beat simply restates readiness instead of crystallizing a charged poise. “The truth is in the shadows” functions as an aphoristic exit, not a Conceptual Repricing that redefines the story’s rule-set. Because no persistent constraint or price is legible on the page, the ending feels self-soothing rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the world “rearranged into a new and mysterious pattern” with conceptual cost (darkness distilled, silence now weighted). Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical pass thickens the ambered hush until the final image reconfigures meaning; orientation is clear by sentence two; no causal reversals are needed for this texture track.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure beat—“Zeta understood that its thoughts came … from the amalgamation of experiences”—is a thematic assertion without a visible, felt, or conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The looped timelines are announced late and never tighten options or foreclose a path; they function as retrospective exposition rather than causal pressure. Orientation is clear, yet the story drifts into summary loops that stall momentum. Because no constraint or price shapes the final image, the ending lands as abstract resonance rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated images of crystal, rain, lens, and doodles deepen the stake of transparency. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lens lifted to eye, world “transformed”—but the cost is only asserted (“mistrust melted”) rather than shown. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks, yet no tightening beat narrows options. One shard, single POV, within word count.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—the garden “knows” the dresser—yet the cost is only atmospheric; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds, but the decisive reconfiguration is asserted, not paid for on the page, keeping it below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands a vivid image—Kaelin bathed in nexus-light—but the cost is only generic “wonder,” not a foreclosed path. Causal chain is thin: simulator fix → hologram → nexus → teleport; none of these steps is obstructed or paid for. Orientation is clear by word 50, yet the lens (Causal) is asserted more than demonstrated. The ending replicates rather than reconfigures; therefore the resonance is atmospheric, not structural.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the water-revealed message reweights Rachel’s alienation into communion with the house, delivering an Accumulative/Textural Charged Poise. Causality holds in the water-program beat; earlier beats slip into atmospheric loops without tightening options, preventing higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated logbook marginalia tighten the weave until the final “smudged” auroral image reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mountain mist and the vanished oracle reprice truth as provisional. The cost is legible in the final sentence—her “faintest hint” is an erasure she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.7)
    Causal chain is thin: finding the wheel → hearing radio → finding logbook → feeling satisfied. No micro-choice reverses direction or forecloses an option; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Closure is “a feeling of clarity” without on-page Decisive Change or visible cost, so lens reads Situational but lands as mood rather than reweighted stance. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—keeper suspended in regenerative silence—yet the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on-page; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final cadence shift is legible but lacks a tangible forfeiture. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, but the single-scene default is stretched by repetitive, loop-like paragraphs that stall momentum. Causality is loose: origami swan hints but does not tighten options; burrowing deepens texture rather than narrowing fate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single causal lens holds: eclipse → shared gaze → song → wonder seeded. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the guitar lingers, curl safe—but no visible price is extracted from Aria, so the Resonant Reconfiguration feels under-costed. Causality is linear, no reversals, no tightened options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of atmospheric density increases until the final “bronze quiet” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tapestry safely stored, the silo’s whispers acknowledged—felt cost is the lingering scent of dust that will draw her back. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. No causal break, but the escalation is ambient rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Accumulative lens declared but pattern never taught; same cadence recycles “open secrets / new key” without deepening. No decisive change or felt cost—final smile is pure sentiment. Lighthouse and microdot remain ornamental; neither constrains final choice nor reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a valid Charged Poise: the silence after sound reweights reality and carries conceptual cost. Causality, however, is soft—the ritual mechanics are metaphor (“loop pedal,” “blue palette”) rather than actionable rules, so the unraveling of stillness feels asserted, not demonstrated. Orientation is clear within 60 words and the single-scene default is met. A firmer causal linkage between pedal layers and dimensional effect would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—the mirrored horizon reconfigures meaning and the writer’s stance is legible—but the cost is only atmospheric, not tactile or irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn light, shell pulse, and map creases deepen texture and reweight the stake of “unheard symphonies.” However, no persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics; the spell simply ends before exhaustion arrives, so the cost feels evanescent rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration in which the labyrinth’s conquest redrafts reality; the city’s "soft, lunar light" is the felt cost. Causal linkage is lyric-elliptical rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught early ("procedural generation") and paid off in the final image. Orientation is strong at 120-word mark. One causality quibble: the tablet never meets an explicit limit that is then overcome—it guides, it never resists—so the victory feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by a final, narrowing trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a lyric assertion (“she knew she would never let it go”) without on-page cost or decisive change; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence merely restates earlier imagery, offering no new reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she stands up determined, stars above. Cost is only asserted (“had to be careful”) rather than dramatized—no path is foreclosed on the page. Causal chain is thin: message → lateral thinking → instant certainty → decision to act, with no intermediate obstacle or test. The lens is situational-accumulative, but the single deepening beat feels more convenient than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied yet glowing vial crystallizes a Charged Poise—memory’s beauty and fragility reweighted with undeniable cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent: scent-memories accumulate until the UV-reveal pattern breaks and deepens the stake. The curator is never anchored spatially, so orientation wobble at ~120 words is minor and does not disturb the ending lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the UV lights shift nostalgia into awe, then grief, then peace—each cadence legible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is present as a Charged Poise: the patterns remain in the grotto and the rope becomes a symbol of “complex choices,” re-weighting meaning. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening—realizing the grotto is a “nexus”—is announced, not dramatized through a beat that costs her anything. Causality is loose: patterning stones does not alter her options or the world; the energy beings stay off-stage, so the catalyst never complicates her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the music “unbinds” the chronic hush and the elderly woman’s hand-grasp reweights community, so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and an RR is legible with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early (“aftermath of the rainforest’s fiery demise”) and anchors spatially by word 50; disorientation is functional at closure, so no penalty. However, the causal chain from object ﬁnd → storytelling → communal quiet → unbinding is asserted, not demonstrated; the greenhouse and shipwrecks never limit or enable tactics, so the tightening is poetic, not mechanical. Thus the RR lands, but without persistent constraint or price shaping tactics, it stays short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical return to glowing stones bookends the piece, supplying a gentle RR. Orientation is swift; amber grotto, dusk, single actor are clear within fifty words. Escalation is poetic accretion—glow intensifies as the “half-truths” are completed—rather than causal narrowing. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto “whispers approval,” a felt but not costly reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is present—locket → meeting Sophia → joint project—but the hinge moment (envelope mix-up) is revealed late and off-stage, weakening the “because/therefore” spine. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the women vow to act, cost acknowledged in “navigate the challenges ahead,” satisfying the RR test. Orientation is clear by word 60, well within the 120-word waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present—Kael’s ache transmutes into peace as the community embraces the arbor—but the cost is declarative (“for the first time, Kael felt truly connected”) rather than visibly paid. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the search accumulates evidence of kinship until the emotional valence flips. Because the final beat is summarized, the reweighting is felt only at narrator-distance, not through an image or action that crystallizes the trade-off. The piece meets the 8.8 gate for clarity but not for on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s rhythm resets, Lyra carries the giant’s borrowed time, and the tremor signals unpaid cost. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative pattern (cadence, echoes) dominates, capped by a Situational tremor. Orientation is swift; rooftop, canal, dawn are anchored by line 3. The spell beat is summarized, not scene-worked, so the decisive change feels lightly earned, not inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s “quiet promise” reweights the earlier “ambiguous loss” with a buried optimism whose cost is the conjurer’s solitary secrecy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of stillness → ritual → hush → dawn cadence tightens the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props. The eyes’ provenance is told in one reflective block ≤20 % and anchors a present micro-choice (scrying), satisfying BRR. Minor loop: “gentle rustle… gentle swaying… gently inventive” drags but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each cached object layers a quiet bid for recognition. The final “whispered promise” supplies Charged Poise, but the cost (remaining forever unseen) is asserted, not shown on the page. Orientation is clear by word 80; no causal break, yet the stakes never tighten—options don’t narrow, they simply accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric repetitions of storm/trellis/leaf build texture rather than causal chain. Closure reaches for Conceptual Repricing, but the "linden leaf...whisper a message" is stated rather than shown through a concrete image that reweights rules; cost is asserted, not felt. Transitions are smooth, yet the missing orientation beat—no concrete first glimpse of the trellis or her stance toward it—blurs anchoring. Because escalation is atmospheric (density of storm imagery) rather than tactical, the tightening is present but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the brooch becomes paint, reframing the island’s history with the felt cost of forever fusing relic to canvas. Causality is loose—rain-trail decoding and wall-markings are more accumulative pattern than because/therefore chain—but the lens holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One soft spot: the stranger’s info-dump on “convergence caused the wars” is off-stage backstory retro-injected, slightly diluting the decisive change’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens is coherent: each paragraph layers sensory texture until the cave’s “eternal song” becomes a conduit for cosmic sight. Causality, however, is weak; the pilgrim’s arrival is explicitly unforeseen even by Aria, so the plot turns on an external gift rather than an internal decision, and the final beat merely ratifies the new status quo. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise—“illuminating the hidden paths” reconfigures her role—but because the cost is only asserted (“humbling”), not dramatized, the effect is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—community healed, valve enshrined—but the causal chain is outline-summarized (“she devised a plan,” “as the days passed”) rather than dramatized; the valve never forces a decisive turn, so the cost is only asserted, not shown, under an Accumulative lens that never tightens on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Causal chain is weak: the punch hums, arrows appear, light blooms—none of these events change Emilia’s options or force a decision. Orientation is clear by ~90 words, but the promised “fortress of unspoken truths” is merely declared present in the final paragraph, not discovered through escalating obstacles. Closure is announced rather than dramatized (“secrets unfolded like a map”); no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost occurs on the page. The lens drifts from causal quest to lyrical tableau without teaching the shift, so the ending feels coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each transcription session adds density until the whales’ song and tile patterns merge into a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words; the tower, sea, and season are anchored early. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the tile stills, Emilia descends, the unheard symphony persists—yet the only cost named is “newfound appreciation,” which feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—goodbye rebranded as transformation—but the causal chain is weak: spatial mutiny is never constrained by rules or price, and the duplicate appears because the storm + amulet say so, not because Kael’s prior choices narrow options. Orientation is clear inside 120 words, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the text never teaches a pattern that makes magnetic-field mechanics legible; the final glow feels author-hand-waved. The cost is asserted (“part of Kael”) rather than dramatized on-page, so resonance is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds: ink pot → reframe → breach plan. Closure is a Charged Poise—"she would be ready"—with conceptual cost (criminal risk) legible, but the decisive moment is projected, not enacted, softening the because/therefore snap. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of “faint hum” lingering after her departure reweights the premise—she can leave, the captured texture cannot. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear by word 40; no telegraphing or causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “the stationer’s pencil danced…capturing the subtleties” repeats the prior sentence’s content (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the survivor slips away, stories now internalized, tide continuing. Cost is conceptual (history reclaimed, identity stay nameless) but lacks a felt price shown on the page; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the tightening is only a cadence shift, not a knowledge or option change that stings. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, yet the ending’s emotional ledger remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.9)
    Closure is a declared triumph (“she knew that she had unlocked the secrets”) rather than a shown reconfiguration; cost is asserted, not felt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of echoing whispers and resonant hums—but the final cadence adds only volume, not stakes. No constraint or forfeiture is legible in the closing image. Orientation wavers—time inside the “whisper of closing pages” is never anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: graffiti campaign → growing unity → deadline resistance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chip becomes emblem of collective refusal, cost legible in “ready to face whatever the future held.” One minor scaffold: the phrase “the perpetual carnival…had become a beacon of hope” restates prior uplift without new pressure.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft-carnival is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“smell of exotic foods,” “ever-floating”—and the chip micro-object constrains allegiance on the page. Spatial anchoring stays coherent; no clutter of tourist detail. Environment steers tactic: graffiti spreads along food-stall walls residents trust. The closing image re-weights the setting itself as living entity, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the grain returned to the summit reweights time and transience. Causal chain is thin—Patel’s timed message is off-stage catalyst, not a because/therefore turn. Orientation clean by word 60. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the chemical timer is mentioned but never limits her choices on the page. Closure cost is felt yet abstract, not linked to a prior concrete stake.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s steady hover reframes the depot’s mist and the ship’s departure into a single re-tuned frequency, felt cost is the hush after exertion. Causal chain is slim—light-through-water “reads” are more poetic conceit than engineering beat—but the accumulative pattern holds. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a lyric reprise (“the snow crunched softly beneath her feet”) that restates the opening ambience; it offers neither decisive change nor conceptual repricing of the convergence quest. Causal linkage is weak: the condensation pattern is decoded off-stage in a single paragraph, then instantly “cracked,” so the stakes never narrow. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image merely re-cycles the same texture without a pattern break or cost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise—the town’s “wild hush” vibrates with new possibility—so the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. However, the cost is purely atmospheric; nothing on the page shows the tuner expending stamina, forfeiting time, or risking failure. Because no constraint or price is legible, the reconfiguration feels gifted rather than earned, capping the story below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-drenched repetitions tighten mood until the energy is bottled. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the temple falls utterly silent, Kael left with scented absence—cost is the world’s voice replaced by perfume. Orientation crystal-clear by 50 words; one looped phrase (“as time runs short”) is minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure drifts into lyric open-endedness rather than legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the lock-touch promises revelation but pays no cost on the page. Orientation is clear; causal chain is weak—“because father told tales” never tightens to “therefore I risk prison.” Lattice pattern taught early holds; lighthouse space is tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated “ephemeral cameo” pattern and bead-touch cadence tighten mood. Closure earns a soft Charged Poise—the greenhouse hum reweighted—yet the cost is only atmospheric; no path is foreclosed for the alchemist, only illuminated.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing tapestry reconfigures the labyrinth from ruin to reverence, cost felt in the canyon’s hush. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light and thread shifts the stake. Causality is loose (“pattern that seemed to emerge of its own accord”), but acceptable under lyric design. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece runs on lyrical accumulation; tension plateaus after the first burial metaphor instead of narrowing options. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the revealed tomb re-weights her belonging—but the cost is moral/philosophical rather than felt, so the resonance is mild. Because the lens holds and the final image recalls the opening, I waive severe penalty, yet the lack of a live trade-off caps the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: repeated neon/journey images tighten nostalgic charge, closure is a Charged Poise (“the letter…pulsate with an energy all its own”) that reweights the slowness stake. No Decisive Change or forfeiture on-page; cost is only asserted. Orientation clean by 120 w. Causality is soft—creation process is looped paraphrase rather than because/therefore—but pattern is coherent and lands under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: stitched shimmer and candle pulse thicken atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure. Yet causality is loose—no concrete beat shows how a stitch uncovers a secret; the coup remains off-stage threat rather than triggered or foreclosed action. Closure image (chart vibrating) carries conceptual cost, but because the embroiderer’s tactic is never specified, the reconfiguration is felt more as mood than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a CR: the window clears to show a composite reflection, conceptually repricing identity. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned lyric recurrence—and the final image merely restates earlier motifs without tightening options or revealing new cost. No beat narrows possibility; the apparition appears because singing “reaches a fever pitch,” not through Aria’s agency, so the ending feels arrived at rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral pulses in darkness, re-weighting shared pain into shared peace; cost is felt in the anesthetic fog that dissolves her agency. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—dense motif repetitions tighten rather than causally chain—held cleanly to the end. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensual layer (fog, fresco, film curtain) thickens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—colors seeping into trees—whose conceptual cost (art surrendered to ruin) is undeniable. One soft spot: “knowledge network” appears only at the end as summary, not causality, but it does not break the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored sound loops builds density toward a cadence shift that reweights the mural stake. Closure image—forest swaying, colors pulsing—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. However, no persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics; certainty surrendered feels symbolic rather than materially foreclosed. Orientation clear by word 120; lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    A single continuous scene is cleanly anchored inside the greenhouse by word 50. Causality is present: because thoughts are taxable, therefore coded gardens. Yet escalation is static—gardening steps listed without tightening or deeper cost. Closure is a Charged Poise image (mature seed dispersing) but the “conceptual cost” is asserted, not dramatized on Lyra’s body or options, so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds weakly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers image-repetition (postcard, fungi, shell) until the final lullaby reweights the stake. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; closure is a Charged Poise—the lullaby crystallizes peace with felt cost. Minor slips: “centuries of longing” is told, not shown, and postcard causality is retrospective; these nudge it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the song ends, light lingers, and the caretaker accepts perpetual return. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence reweight the stake rather than causal chain. Cost is present (“lonely…labor of love”) but abstract; no concrete forfeiture is shown. Orientation is clear by line 20; no transitions or shard breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: misinterpretation → self-exile → relentless method → breakthrough. Archive location and mentor-gift ink well are anchored by 120 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: empty glowing well + finished page reweight her solitude into chosen sanctuary; cost is the last drop of ink and the paths that now “diverge,” foreclosing older collaborations. Pressure tightens once—ink almost gone, time “before paths diverge”—but still feels singular, not accumulative; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: Kaelin “smiled” and felt “peace,” but no decisive change or conceptual cost is legible. Accumulative lens holds—images of breathing stone and dappled light recur and re-weight the stake—but the promised harmonization of values remains abstract. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The ending’s cost is asserted (“weight of her task”) rather than dramatized, so the beat lands as uplift rather than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust/pigeon/book motifs layer toward a lyric RR. Closure = Charged Poise (dust swirl re-balanced) with conceptual cost (her past stays forged), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no prop or choice visibly lost. Orientation clean by word 60; however, the “learning to trust again” timeline is back-loaded summary, not on-page causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is present—father’s beckoning reconfigures the child’s “lost” stance—but the necessary-distance rule is asserted, not dramatized: no on-page beat shows distance actually narrowing or foreclosing a live option; causality is thematic echo, not because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ambience thickens via bioluminescence, echoing corridors, and firefly motif until a Charged Poise ends the arc. Orientation is secured by ~130 words; the burnt feather acts as taught anchor that re-weights at dawn. No decisive change is performed, but the final “luminous respite” crystallizes options with felt cost—astrologer leaves at sunrise, path foreclosed. Causality stays soft (mood governs more than because/therefore), yet the pattern is legible and closure obeys the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the symbols re-weight the disappearing-path rule with undeniable conceptual cost—“flux is the only constant.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural: seeds → deeper → symbols → re-weighting; each beat layers density rather than forcing a turn. Orientation is nailed inside 50 words; no world-rule break. Yet the re-appearance of the path is narrated, not dramatized on the page, softening the Decisive Change punch.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-scene orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated “orchestrated serendipity” phrases and star/chess imagery accumulate texture until the final beat reweights the stake—audience enchantment as conceptual profit. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elian pockets the heavier bishop, feeling “secrets waiting,” which reconfigures the night as ongoing gambit; cost is felt (future obsession) though not paid on-page. Meets 9+ test formally, but the lack of visible constraint or price keeps it in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is signaled early (pattern of “gaps” and star-garden texture) and held; closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing verse on skin crystallizes meaning and forecloses her exile. Orientation anchors inside 120 words, transition-free; moonstone re-appears at climax to reweight stakes. Causality is loose (anchoring is magical coincidence), but under lyric design that is acceptable; still, the final cost is felt more as image than consequence, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers visual echoes (mirror-bay, prism, rings) until a final cadence shift reweights “mundane” as luminous. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered. However, the closure is a Charged Poise that gestures at cost rather than staging it—the glazier simply walks away lighter—so the reconfiguration feels gentle, not irrevocable. Because no option is foreclosed on-page, the story stops just shy of publish-now punch.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images (moon, ridge, box, mirror) layer and finally reweight meaning rather than cause plot turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—mirror-gazing crystallizes his new messenger stance with undeniable emotional cost (“the pain…a universal language”). Orientation anchor (who/where) cleared by line 3; single transition from path to memory back to path is legible. No causal break, but escalation is poetic density, not tightening of options, so stays within lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a mood shift (“sense of peace and clarity”) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no option is foreclosed, no cost is legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence plateaus instead of reweighting the stake. Orientation is clear early, yet the vision sequence is causally inert—gauges glow because the text needs wonder, not because Aria’s pattern-making triggers consequence. Causality remains slack; therefore the piece fails the 9+ cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the cartographer left behind a piece of themselves” reweights legacy from burden to gift, with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo/mapping deepens across paragraphs, final cadence crystallizes. Orientation Test waived—disorientation early (shadowy corridor, unnamed time) pays off in final charged image. One causality slip: diaries appear in cold hearth without prior cue, but this does not break overall linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece relies on repeating chromatic and musical motifs that deepen mood until a final image re-weights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The mirrors’ ripple at the end provides a resonant reconfiguration (RR) that reframes the painter’s palette as a divining tool, satisfying closure. However, the climax is delivered by the mirrors’ autonomous reaction rather than a decisive turn born from her agency, so causality feels lightly external; cost is atmospheric, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.7)
    The closure is a soft atmospheric exhale rather than a decisive change; peace is declared in abstract summary (“negotiations edged closer to a breakthrough”) with no on-page beat where Elian’s agency forecloses an option or pays a price. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is weak: celestial imagery and floral scent accumulate mood but do not reweight stakes or meaning. The ebony clipboard is ritually invoked, yet its ritual mechanics are never taught, so the final image of it as “symbol of his own redemption” lands as Conceptual Repricing without conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored floodwaters and echoed birds reweight the salt flat from wasteland to living ecosystem with conceptual cost—she vanishes into the storm, leaving her morality untested. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each crack → river path → released water, tight under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; map/egg anchors taught by line 6. One meaningful deepening: the lull before thunder becomes the ticking clock that triggers release. Cost is legible in the final image of her disappearance, though price feels conceptual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the echo pattern and held to closure. Orientation clean: silver courtyard / snowfall / night anchored in first 50 words. The decisive tightening occurs when the last thread is untangled, releasing harvested echoes; prism glow reweights the rule-set (Conceptual Repricing) with undeniable cost—she is “no longer bound.” Persistent constraint: the prism dims, signaling spent power. One causal micro-gap: how untangling threads physically triggers prism glow is elided, but the lyrical logic is taught early enough to waive as pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece thickens mood via iterative dome/stick references until a quiet Charged Poise closes on “meteor hush” as CR. Orientation is immediate; causality is loose but acceptable under lyric design. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dome’s silence now frames her future subversions—so the unit is valid. However, no causal trigger escalates options; density alone does the work, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure aims for Charged Poise: the fragile structures left behind should reconfigure meaning. The image is pretty, but the causal chain is weak—no prior constraint or price shapes the decision to leave, so the poise feels unearned. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the “migration of the last monarch” functions as decorative time-stamping rather than a tightening clock. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights stakes before the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope’s hum reweights memory and carries felt cost (“sound of forgotten names” now audible). Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each braid tightened adds density until the final resonance—but the punch-card’s rule-set is introduced late, so the decisive mechanism feels lightly motivated rather than foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the storm’s end reframes the bunker walk as chosen path rather than free will, but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each dream-sentence adds texture yet none tightens options or forecloses a path; tension plateaus rather than escalates. The midpoint lens is clear (dreams → knowledge) but the final image does not twist or deepen that pattern—it merely restates it in greener air. The missing causal trigger between “I learned” and “therefore I accept” keeps the closure gentle, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence repetitions (“the astronomer felt…”) deepen mood rather than advance cause. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tile lifted to starlight—whose conceptual cost (life’s work complete) is legible but abstract; no concrete price is shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary’s atmosphere is audibly altered, the broken box now a silent talisman of peace, and the cost is the permanent fracture of the pin—an irreversible price that reweights harmony as fragile, not fixed. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens coheres: each para thickens the ambient pattern until the melody itself bends reality. The 0.1 deduction is for a late, slightly convenient re-entry of the music-box magic; it is not foreshadowed as a repeatable force, so the final beat leans on grace rather than set-up. Still, the image of a cracked cylinder sustaining a community is strong enough to satisfy the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers frost, fog, and glass imagery until the mirror crystallizes the pattern. Orientation is swift—who, where, when all land within 60 words. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-maker vanishes, the sextant stays, boundaries erased at felt cost (“the faintest whisper of her presence”). The single causal gap—how breathing sync alone fuses dream to glass—remains minor and lyrical, not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative lens: orchard’s revival is textured through seed-planting, visitor influx, ribbon reprise. Closure is a soft Charged Poise: daughter’s touch on ribbon reweights earlier breach, but cost is asserted (“deep sense”) rather than dramatized; no path is foreclosed for Elara, blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (knowledge = nonlinear web) but cost is only asserted, not felt. Causal chain is loose: pistachio shell has no causal role, bathroom epiphany lacks trigger. Orientation is clear early; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern of scent/image density.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a soft thematic uplift (“she had found a new path”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the library door simply opens and the diary is pocketed without price. Causal chain is outline-level: “by researching gaps” is declared, never shown narrowing options or raising stakes. The Orientation Test is waived because the labyrinthine store is deliberately disorienting, but the lens stays blurry—mid-text shifts between causal quest and accumulative texture without teaching the pattern—so a −0.3 lens ambiguity penalty applies. Teleporting props (diary appears exactly where needed) and off-stage pursuit keep tension abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of stories-within-stories builds texture until the Garden materializes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Lyra’s arrival reconfigures the quest as internal—but the cost is only asserted (“sense of peace”), not dramatized. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Causality is loose: the card’s message never tightens options; stories are discovered, not pursued.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story lands a soft Conceptual Repricing—the rope pattern re-weights the “fables of absence”—but the cost is purely asserted (“she had been changed”) rather than dramatized. Causality is linear and talky: the professor announces the rope trick, they perform it, time hiccups, then resets; no prior constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, yet the midpoint “door shouldn’t exist” rule is introduced ex nihilo and never jeopardizes Emilia’s agency. Under the Accumulative lens the final image resonates, but the lack of a felt price keeps closure thin.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a lyric Earned Stasis: the caves settle into “hammered repose” and she accepts perpetual guardianship; the hush lands with conceptual cost—her life’s labor is now endless caretaking. Causality is accumulative/textural: each examination of ice cracks incrementally attunes the cave until the bloom emerges; the lens holds. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3 and remain stable. One soft spot: the energy beings’ sudden attunement is asserted rather than shown, a micro-break in texture, but it does not rupture the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—light flares, knowledge rekindled—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of humming, star charts, thistle scent tighten into final glow. Causality is loose; shard simply “flares” when touched, no trade-off or constraint. Orientation clear by 50 words; no meaningful tightening mid-arc, only repetition of “custodian walks and feels awe.” Cost is aesthetic, not tactical, so resonance stays mild.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative lens holds: sensory fragments and memory shards layer toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—moonlit hush crystallizes her guardian stance—yet the cost is only atmospheric, not concrete. No prior constraint or price shapes tactics; the story never risks losing anything. Orientation is clear by sentence four; transitions are smooth, but escalation is lyrical rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: dusk → lantern-glow → starless hush layers mood until the final “canvas” reweights stakes. Orientation is swift; location and POV stay consistent. Closure is Charged Poise—her imagination “ablaze” with possibility—but the cost (time, materials, risk) is only implied, not tethered to an on-page constraint, so resonance is soft. No causal tightening forecloses an option; the uplift is atmospheric, not decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn light crystallizes the observer’s charged poise, paying off the cicada motif with felt cost—she leaves the timeless grotto carrying transformation in hand. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlight, dripping water, and insect hum accrue until the cadence shift at daybreak reweights the stake. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal break. Deduction for late-onset agency: the decisive change is purely tonal, not action-forced, so the cost is atmospheric, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of silence-tasting builds density until the gilded hush reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise: the hovering doll crystallizes options and carries visible cost (the child’s contracted world “stretches”). No orientation debt; spatial anchors (trellis lattice, cloud level) arrive by line 4. Father’s motivation (desensitization by sensory deprivation) is causal glue that holds the ellipse of inversion-hour.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece lands a gentle Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “palpable silence” reweights the premise, implying the operator’s quiet labor has succeeded. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the pattern holds—each drifting paragraph thickens the hush rather than tightens causal links. However, no persistent constraint or price shapes the outcome; the closure feels atmospheric rather than paid-for. Orientation is clear within 120 words and the single shard is coherent, but the absence of a decisive turn keeps the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is present—flake → murals → stairway → throne—but each link is a gift, not a decision that costs her anything. Closure lands on the page (she sits, sun rises), yet the only “cost” is the abstract weight of destiny; no option is foreclosed, no price is felt. The murals’ warning of hubris is never mirrored by a visible risk Aria incurs, so the lens stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the revitalized threshold and glowing ring reweight the keeper’s earlier isolation, making a before/after legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of shadow imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal chains—and the final image crystallizes options with felt cost: the keeper must now re-enter the world. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ashen charcoal sanctuary”) and never slips. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the ring’s state change is tracked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a sparkly release of diamonds with no causal cost or constraint; luck, not choice, produces the turn. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure → glitter—but the final image reweights nothing because Lyra sacrifices nothing. The Orientation Test is waived: the mushroom-farm glow is taught early and does serve the final shimmer, so no penalty, yet the lack of motivated escalation keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.1)
    Closure is asserted, not dramatized: “they knew they had uncovered a truth” is summary, not a visible Decisive Change or Charged Poise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely restates earlier images (golden shadows, crank handle) without reweighting stakes. No persistent constraint or price is legible on the page. Orientation is clear, but the ending beat breaks the accumulative contract by offering only thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the merger with “shape of possibility” re-weights reality and carries implied cost. Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore; the unsnap triggers the cascade but the link between wooden snap and cosmic shift is asserted, not motivated. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust-pattern reading → memory tapestry → sanctuary of remembrance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: the room’s glow re-weights her exile into vocation. Orientation anchors early; no causal break. However, no single tightening reverses her options—escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—so cost is felt but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive is Accumulative/Textural: starlight, lagoon glow, and coded whispers build mood toward a Charged Poise. Causality is loose—no because/therefore between hiding and surfacing; the map appears once and does not narrow options. Closure image (Aria vanishing at dawn) is resonant but lacks felt cost; the stakes of being caught or losing history remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: mist and music thicken texture toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear by line 20; the missing piece is causal traction—music is said to “counter” prophecy yet no beat shows prophecy resisting or the music altering anyone’s option. Closure image (mist re-invading while melody lingers) is resonant but the conceptual cost is only gestured at, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of decoding leaves and glowing specks early and holds it to closure. The final image—arbor glowing with residual moonstone light—delivers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole experience. Cost is present but diffuse (time, self-loss); a crisper sentence of forfeiture would have pushed this into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the humming device reframes uncertainty from threat to companion, with the compass rose visibly re-weighted in hand. Causality under an Accumulative lens holds: each shard (workshop → greenhouse → return) adds density to the “uncertain yet certain” motif. The greenhouse improvisation is the one tightening beat that narrows options—once built, the tool re-configures life rules. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the foundry is reframed from tomb to crucible, and the “weight of names” becomes a guiding force; the cost is felt via the months of methodical labor implied. Causality stays intact under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat deepens the same stake—though the story leans on reflective summary rather than scene-level tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene causal chain holds: spot → approach → listen → release; closure lands with Charged Poise as the harp fades and the tooth is left behind, a felt relic of the exchange. Orientation is swift, lens stays causal, cost is legible in the lingering “luminous ache.”

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The UV-forest premise is taught early and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the causal chain is loose: the forest brightens because she nears it, and understanding arrives as epiphany rather than earned turn. Orientation is clean, but the rescue timeline and Arin’s medical logistics stay off-stage, so restraints-to-walkout feels shortcut. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; a single density spike suffices, but without a visible price paid on-page the reconfiguration feels under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lens glows, boundaries blur, and Lena accepts her translator vocation with conceptual cost—she will forever “unfasten anchors.” Causality, however, is loose: the fragment jolts memory, but the leap from souvenir to mission occurs off-stage during reflection. Orientation is clear within 50 words; the single-scene default is met. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the final cadence reweights earlier images, satisfying the RR test, yet the middle beats accumulate atmosphere more than narrowing options, so escalation stays soft.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The closure attempts a Charged Poise (she’ll keep hunting stories) but the price is never dramatized—she leaves the office exactly as she entered, toolbox intact, job unaffected. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern reweights meaning at the end; the ghosts simply “fade into the distance,” letting atmosphere substitute for change. The dust-to-logbook reveal is a single coincidence that complicates nothing; it never forces Ezra to act or surrender a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost prints layer until they resonate with the cloud-sea. Closure is a Charged Poise—the golden hush that reweights “eternity is a moment’s depth.” Cost is conceptual, not embodied; the library’s breath-hold is lovely but abstract, so the repricing feels light. Causality is musical rather than consequential; acceptable for this design, yet short of punch.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal chain holds: shard discovery → devise analysis → re-imagine world → self-re-imagined. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard on the desk re-weights her identity with felt cost (‘still present…tempered’). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The mirrors/‘visible time’ rule is taught early and paid off in the covered-mirrors ritual, satisfying the pattern waiver. Cost is legible but could be sharper—no concrete resource lost beyond spent time.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: thick sensory layering builds toward the chord release. Closure is a Charged Poise (crystalline note fills chamber), but the cost is only atmospheric; nothing is foreclosed for Erebus. Causality is thin—golden chip guides, box sings—so the reconfiguration feels aesthetic, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a lyric CR—“she felt herself becoming one with the lagoon”—but the beat is asserted, not caused; the compass points, she follows, then transcendence simply arrives. Because/therefore chains are missing; the ancient symbols do not test or foreclose any option, so the cost is conceptual only and thinly grounded. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the drive lens (Hybrid) is unstable—early causal beats give way to accumulative reverie without a taught pattern, so escalation feels like repetition of awe rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft CR: the sculpture “stood as a testament” reweights prior material, but the conceptual cost is asserted, not dramatized. Causal chain: GPS failure → find slide → make sculpture; the slide never constrains later tactics, so the final image feels coincidental. Orientation clean by word 80; no lens contradiction, yet escalation flatlines after slide discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the text teaches a pattern of seasonal melt and chromatic drain that reweights creativity toward nocturne. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Luna’s last mural glows moon-cold, “illuminating the path…” with the conceptual cost of permanent stylistic exile legible on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 60 words, well under the 120-word allowance. Causality remains associative rather than strictly causal, acceptable under the selected lens; no luck resolves the core question.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft vow of future return, not a decisive change or charged poise with felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image merely re-invokes the lagoon rather than reweighting stakes. Causality is loose: the diary is mentioned as trigger but never decodes on-page; Ada’s debris messages are watched, not acted upon, so the parley produces no tactical shift. Orientation is clear early, yet the midpoint drifts into repetitive scenic stasis rather than a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a declarative pivot (“now it was time to bring their vision to life”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no option is foreclosed, no price is shown. Causal chain is iterative summary—“they pondered…they recalled…they began to work”—with no tightening beat that narrows possibility. Working-memory gimmick is asserted but never complicates or limits tactics; therefore the lens drifts toward decorative Accumulative rather than causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the wax shaving becomes a Conceptual Repricing—archived emotions now pulse with autonomous life, the scribe’s life’s work turned unknowable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: emotional density rises via iterated sensory motifs (lantern glow, leaf rustle, wax absorption) until the final cadence shift. Causality is interior but legible—immersion → archiving → prophecy ignition → renunciation. The cost is unmistakable: “the foghorn remained silent,” a permanent acoustic void that reweights every prior sound cue.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise: the cap lingers in hand while the vortex hums, re-weighting time as “borrowed.”  However causality is loose—how blowing an acorn cap rewires entropy is neither taught nor constrained, so the final image charms but doesn’t foreclose a path with felt price. Mosaic design (one continuous lyrical flow) is coherent, yet the speculative rule-set remains ornamental rather than operative at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: micro-observations and bell tones layer until a quiet cadence shift reweights the stake from danger-warning to listening-beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final bell toll crystallizes the new role with undeniable pressure. Cost is only atmospheric (“solstice hush”); no concrete opportunity or relationship is forfeited, keeping the effect mild.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise via the lantern-glass talisman, but the cost is only asserted (“strength lies in vulnerability”). Accumulative lens holds, yet the final paragraph re-states theme rather than reweighting options. No causal tightening occurs; the night simply ends. Orientation is clear, but the story never risks a real reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box closes, ghosts disperse, and the recluse carries the unspoken words inward—an undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of ghost-gathering and letter-reading intensifies until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and hold. No因果 turns are required under this lens; the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the capsule’s repair reframes the silo from mausoleum to beacon. The accumulative lens holds—pattern builds through garage-sale messages—though the decisive reweight is more epiphany than causal turn. Cost is conceptual but legible: the world stays broken, the keeper’s exile permanent. Orientation anchors early; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery layers rather than causal chains drive the piece. Orientation is immediate; lagoon, post-dawn, single POV are set by line 15. Closure lands as Charged Poise—mirror-calm lagoon re-weights the “woven dawns” motif with felt stillness. The cost is present but soft: transience embraced rather than a path foregone, satisfying the 600-word lyric exception.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower and entity fade into a felt connection, the amber pulses, a conceptual cost is legible. However, the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the single tightening—air thickening, bronze quiet deepening—is poetic accretion rather than causal narrowing; stakes remain atmospheric, not tactical. Orientation is secure by word 60. The ending image reweights the premise, satisfying the quick test, but the lack of an on-page forfeiture keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the garden-to-be is promised, the battlefield is symbolically surrendered, and the coachman’s quiet satisfaction supplies felt cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is light—no obstacle, reversal, or price alters his path—yet the final image reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by word 60; the single-scene default is met. The lack of any tightening or escalation keeps the structural arc too level for the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causal linkage holds: wax-leaf sensation → riddle cue → phonograph decode → spring found, each step because/therefore. Cost is soft: fatigue is summarized, the spring arrives as gift rather than earned forfeiture, and the closure image (“wax orb glowed”) reprises motif without crystallizing a new constraint. Orientation clear by line 8; no lens ambiguity; meets 600-word single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the compass glow aligns with the horizon light, re-weighting stillness into forward motion; cost is felt as the “echoed silence” yielding to “soft whisper of possibility.” Causality is accumulative/textural; the sketch act and compass glow accumulate until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty. The sketch custom is the single reflective block, anchored and within limits. No meaningful tightening mid-text; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, but suffices for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is light but linear under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each descriptive layer deepens atmosphere rather than narrows options. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the sky steadies and the spire sings—offering tonal RR rather than decisive cost. The swap itself is dramatized, but the “ceremonial act” costs nothing visible; the tension never tightens, only decorates. Missing micro-turn or constraint keeps the arc ornamental rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a lyric-accumulative closure (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens: the final “luminous absence” image reweights the chessboard and footprints, leaving the trio suspended in crystallized option. Cause-and-effect is loose—historian’s arrival and word-walk are more ritual than causal—but the pattern is taught early and the resonance lands with conceptual cost, satisfying short-form closure. Orientation is clear by ~60 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bookstore becomes a “threshold to new possibilities” and the stone stays changed, both legible. Cost is implied (“she vanished”) but not felt on the page; no persistent price shapes tactics. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of glyphs, shadows, thunder—held to the end. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no causal break but escalation is soft, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal linkage holds: because he decodes the tapestry, therefore he finds the labyrinth; because he walks it, therefore he reweights his guilt. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (time-frozen village, cobblestone street, ozone) and the rule-set of frozen time is taught early. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he leaves the labyrinth with “deep, abiding peace,” the visible cost being his prior exile and the labor of decoding. Minor slip: the thunder-lull timeframe never tightens decisions; it’s mood only.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the same lyric wave—poetry → refracted mist → spire revelation—loops with rising sensory density; the final spire epiphany acts as Conceptual Repricing, giving the mist-veil a felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3, well under the 120-word ceiling. Single continuous scene, one POV, one dominant stake; no violation of scope defaults. The central causality is atmospheric accumulation, not because/therefore; acceptable under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed pattern reweights the statue into a map, the acid sea still foaming beneath, cost felt in her near-drowning. Causal linkage holds—each parchment match narrows oxygen further—yet the midpoint mentor flashback is a 70-word unmotivated ellipse that halts pressure. Orientation is clear by line 10; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, density tightening toward the final image without contradiction. Persistent constraint (lung-time) shapes every tactic; the charm’s glow is a harmless echo, not a causal prop.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the finished canvas holding “temporary eternity”—with conceptual cost legible, yet the middle pivot (wrong-turn oasis) is coincidence-heavy and the causal chain from cracked mirror to vow to hidden cave remains asserted, not dramatized; orientation within the cave network is vague past the 120-word window, triggering −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: imagery and scent layers intensify to a Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation is immediate; the garden-lighthouse continuum anchors by word 30. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—Elian’s worldview is altered—but the cost is only asserted (“indelible mark”) rather than dramatized; hence the cap. No meaningful tightening mid-text; the piece drifts on perfume rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty plain reweights prior fragments and the censer foot becomes a talisman of acceptance, cost felt in the sunrise hush. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical but coherent: because moon → heightened perception → therefore follows calls → therefore reaches plain; ellipsis (who phones, how terrain is “mapped”) is allowed under Accumulative lens. Orientation is complete by word 60; no penalty. Transitions (station → night journey → dawn plain) are legible in two-shard default. A tighter causal bite—one failed map, one aborted route—would sharpen the tightening turn required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forager steps into the storm clutching the relic-eye, a legible image of accepting fractured grace. Causality, however, is loose; the leap from “rumored cures” to actual ingestion/occlusion is compressed into a single paragraph, so the decisive change feels inferred rather than because/therefore driven.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the lighthouse-as-memory-bank motif accretes via repeated gaze and mist, but the pattern is taught late (~40% in) and the closure is a soft Charged Poise—Kael holds the flower, no new option closed. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The missing decisive change or felt cost keeps this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: creek-rising cadence, ant-procession pattern, map-in-stone texture tighten the stake toward a Charged Poise ending—final chamber reveal reweights “promise” with felt cost. Causality is loose: ants-as-guides, chip-as-key, and disappearing path are magical equivalences rather than because/therefore links, acceptable under chosen lens. Closure lands cleanly—she crosses threshold, reads father note, chamber opens—options reconfigure, heritage cost is legible. Orientation anchors by word 60; no ambiguity at end; one soft ellipsis (how path vanishes) waived under lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure fails: the “wondrous, terrible truth” is off-stage, so no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing lands on the page; the story simply stops at the threshold. Causality is sequential (“and then she climbed”) rather than pressure-driven; the bleeding starlight never tightens options or exacts a visible price. Orientation is acceptable—cobalt/ember grottos are anchored early—but the lens remains Accumulative only in description density, not in meaning shift.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure is present as a soft Charged Poise, but the lens wobbles: early text promises causal inquiry yet slides into accumulative lyricism without teaching the shift. The nautilus reveals patterns, yet nothing is foreclosed—no datum falsified, no hypothesis abandoned—so the conceptual cost is too diffuse. “Density of presence” remains abstract; the final image does not reweight prior stakes. Orientation holds, but the causal chain is slack.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll glows, reweighting the premise. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and while the pattern of dream-bleed is taught early, the single tightening (jealousy → creative fire) is only asserted, not shown to foreclose any live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the fog that once “dulled” becomes the medium through which she consents to keep seeing—an earned stasis with conceptual cost (permanent occlusion = permanent vocation). Causality is accumulative: each object-scene thickens the pattern rather than forces a fork. The screw’s final line (“waiting to be uncovered”) reweights the whole montage, satisfying the lens. Orientation is prompt; no prop or motive breaks the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the platform drift, scent, quill-scratch, and sunset build density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful shift—the whispers cueing the writing surge—tightens the cadence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spent quill across parchment crystallizes the stillness-to-storm arc with visible artifact-cost; the inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated sensory motifs (perfume hum, orchard hush, paper scent) build toward a quiet Charged Poise. Closure is present—the air stills, apology “sent”—but the cost is conceptual, not felt; no option is foreclosed for Lyra. Orientation is clear by word 60. The orchard-clock is announced twice yet never tightens tactics; the chainsaws never advance, so tension plateaus rather than tightens. Causality is metaphoric, not sequential, which fits the lens but keeps stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise: Aria re-enters the echoing hall having “unified” self and cosmos. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of hush and image builds to a final cadence shift. Cost, however, is only poetic (“the cosmos sang a new song”); no concrete constraint or forfeiture is locked to the beat. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the middle third repeats atmospheric variations without tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: rhythmic returns of quiet ticking and dawn/dusk cycles re-weight the stake of temporal understanding. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by word 50; no orientation penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise image—shepherd at dawn, key returned, clocks humming—but the cost is only atmospheric; no option is foreclosed or price paid on-page, so the effect hovers at “pleasing stasis” rather than decisive change. One distinct issue: the backwards-counting method is named but never shown altering a concrete decision, so the promised conceptual break never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the world “revealing itself to be a complex, interconnected web” reweights the premise, and the cost is the loss of separateness she now feels. Causality is accumulative/textural: repeated nocturnal walks + mushroom glow + peripheral silhouettes build toward the reconfiguration rather than a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The lens holds, but the price is more declarative than visceral—no tangible object lost or stance renounced—so the effect is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern-glow re-weights the stake, making the father’s recovery feel newly possible yet fragile. Causality is associative (subway graffiti → insight → plan), not tight because/therefore, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final cadence shift satisfies it. Orientation is crisp within the first 60 words; no penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.7)
    Closure is an asserted epiphany—“they had truly taught endings how to begin”—with no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the cost is never made visible or felt. The loop motif merely repeats rather than tightens; causal linkage is missing, so the ending feels circular, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated blooming/tide/photo motifs deepen tone rather than cause plot turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—the jetty left in darkness with photo archived—offering conceptual cost of eternal deferral. However, no causal trigger narrows options mid-story; the covenant remains off-stage lore, so escalation is pure texture. Orientation is clear by word 50; no lens ambiguity, hence meets short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain: rumor → gathering → communion is legible, but each step is summarized, not tested. No reversal or obstacle narrows options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Closure is a gentle fade (“the world was just a little bit brighter”)—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost, yet the price is social, not personal. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but the tightening beat is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory refrain (“musical notes,” “quiet blaze”) intensifies toward a Charged Poise at the stillpoint. The closure image reweights the premise—mapmaker’s stance toward sorrow is reconfigured—but the cost is only sub-textually felt (“trepidation and wonder”) rather than visible. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. One soft reset: the ring glow is first heirloom, then oracle; the rule shift is un-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unbent pen plus anomaly ink rewrites her garden’s meaning, showing editing history as self-revision; cost is felt in the thickened air and louder whispers. Causal chain holds: bad seeds → pen restoration → new narrative control. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of whispers and ink reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera’s empty lens reframes the night’s symphony, reweighting memory vs. forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost—this qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pattern of “silence→sign→music” is taught early and coheres at the final image. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each artwork adds density until a pattern re-weights the promise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the trail crystallizes meaning and the tapestry smile re-anchors the vow—so RR is valid. Cost is conceptual (the archive now “speaks” through Elian’s art) but not viscerally felt; the final image is resonant yet lacks a concrete price extracted from Elian on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the dimmed lagoon re-weights the shared dream with undeniable conceptual loss. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each drumming beat intensifies the glow until the inevitable fade—so the lens holds. The Orientation Test is passed by word 40. No tangible prop or price alters tactics, so the resonance is aesthetic rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.7)
    Closure is missing: no decisive change, charged poise, or conceptual repricing occurs—the key, coin, and map are introduced but none alter her options or the world-rule. Causality is outline-level: she “sets off” because she has a key, not because prior events close alternatives. Orientation is clear, but the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never tightens; the storm and labyrinth stay atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal linkage is weak: the figure arrives because the scene needs the box, not because guardian action summons or permits it. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the shutter-shadow and mirror-glow reweight the moment—but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by word 60, yet the missing “why this night” anchor keeps the guardian’s presence feel arbitrary. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: pattern and weather thicken mood until the final image crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens is declared repeatedly (“forests of second thoughts,” “amplified quiet”) yet no pattern break or cadence shift sharpens the stake. Escalation is circular: mist, grotto, windows repeat the same emotional pitch instead of narrowing options. Closure is summary—“the world around him was different now”—offering no decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise with felt cost. Orientation is clear, but causality is replaced by lyrical restatement that never tests the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagistic repetition (whale call, glowing scrimshaw, watery darkness) intensifies until the final “state of being” reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors cleanly inside 120 words; the single scene holds. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the island is metaphorized and the scrimshaw’s glow crystallizes the new stance—yet the cost (what is actually forfeited?) is only implied, not felt on-page, keeping the RR short of undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: Echo’s voice falls silent under the turbines’ silhouette, reweighting the mandate-era ruins with “remade hush.” Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of narrations thickens until the final withheld word; cost is the unspoken grief now fixed in the dried bouquet. One soft loop: “remade hush” is named twice in summary; no on-page reversal forces Echo to stop speaking, so the silence feels chosen but not compelled. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image (“soft glow…illuminating the path ahead”) reconfigures stakes and makes the cost of boundary-dissolution felt. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt atrium by the frozen lake” by line 2). Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sensory intensification and cadence shift holds to the end. One beat of meaningful tightening—Lyra’s surrender to the quartz hum—suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece strings lyrical observations rather than causal links. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the courtyard “grew quiet” with “gentle hum”—but no new constraint or price reconfigures options; imperfection was already embraced mid-text. Repeated “as the days passed” and “the story would continue” diffuse tension instead of tightening. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity, but escalation is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: pattern of sound-discoveries thickens toward a Charged Poise closure (“the bell ringer simply smiled” reconfigures stance). Yet no persistent constraint or price shapes the final image; the smile is cost-free, so the Resonant Reconfiguration is present but weak.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (curtains, origami stellar tuning) and lands a resonant reconfiguration when the brooch captures starlight. Causality is soft—origami merely “subtly alter” celestial bodies without tangible feedback or failure path—so pressure feels atmospheric rather than consequential. Closure is present and charged (textual image of the stencil shimmering) but cost is conceptual, not felt on the body or scene. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.7)
    The piece accumulates textured vignettes rather than causal beats; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or density shift re-weights the stake at closure—only a quiet restatement of purpose. Orientation is clear by 120 words, yet the absence of a tightening or decisive change keeps the closure below the 9-band threshold. Cost is asserted (“world outside struggled”) but never localized to her body, tool, or options, so the ending feels like pause, not pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a lyric vision rather than a causal or situational reconfiguration; the pagoda magically grants insight without any prior constraint or price that shapes tactics. The “avoid patterns” instruction is never activated on-page—no pattern is resisted or broken by the protagonist. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the lens drifts from situational pressure to pure accumulative image, weakening escalation. Because the final image reweights nothing that was foreshadowed as costly, the ending feels ornamental, not inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers footage, stone, and shadow imagery until the final image reweights the premise (library glow = conceptual repricing of hope). Orientation is swift; causality is looser—her decision to act is summarized, not beat-driven. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (“the shape of hope was still present”), satisfying the CR test, so the arc coheres even though the turning point is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the mist-cloak and the chameleon’s calm gaze crystallizes her new Charged Poise, foreclosing the old dogmatic path without sentimental recap. Accumulative lens holds throughout; each paragraph adds a translucent layer of sensory pattern that tightens the emotional screw until the final stillness. Cost is legible in the shed skin of conviction, even though no external price is yet paid. A hairline slip: the workshop’s spatial anchors arrive late (~130 words), but the mist functions as taught disorientation that pays off in the closing shimmer, so waive Orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise (Resonant Reconfiguration) in the hidden chamber: the hourglass and scar-reading motive crystallize with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of digging, whispering plants, coffee-ring augury—rather than because/therefore chain; the lens holds and is legible at end. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The scar-reading payoff is seeded early and returned, meeting the 9+ quick test, yet the “displaced miracle” concept is asserted rather than demonstrated, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gazer exits carrying the “weight of unused love,” a felt conceptual cost. Causality, however, is weak; the film strip initiates the vision but no beats narrow options or test agency. Orientation is clear inside the booth, yet the outside world and temporal anchor remain vague. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the density increase is mostly descriptive repetition rather than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated aurora/astrolabe imagery intensifies toward a Charged Poise at dawn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—creativity is “freed” via cosmic communion—but the cost is purely atmospheric, not dramatized; no path is visibly foreclosed. Causality is loose: the stars don’t push back, and the calendar tracking never tightens options. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is present—Asa’s form re-solidifies at dawn, the archive secured, the dune gentled: a Charged Poise that reweights the world from ash to glow. Causality, however, is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; the clock restart causes the dune to bloom, but that bloom is metaphor, not tactical consequence. Orientation is legible inside 120 words, so no orientation penalty, yet the archive’s “occasionally everywhere” trait is never rule-taught, letting coincidence masquerade as logic. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift lands, but the cost is atmospheric, not palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: repeated wind/gear/hum imagery intensifies toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—the gear’s final vibration reweights the rainforest as mental gateway—so the unit qualifies. Yet orientation wavers: no concrete when/where anchor arrives within 120 words; “Mechanical rainforest” remains floating metaphor. Causality is loose—translocation is declared, never tested or blocked—so cost feels asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: the journey’s mood thickens by repetition of mist, star stamp, shoreline lullaby. Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn reveals the new shore and the stamped palm glows, reweighting the premise with felt cost. However, no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics; the trek is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: silence-as-texture thickens through repetition, cadence, and snow. Orientation clean by 120 words; cobalt fortress/spiral stair give immediate where/when. Closure is Charged Poise: “silence was no longer oppressive” reweights the premise, but the cost is conceptual only—no concrete forfeiture shown. Pattern holds, yet the final beat lacks tangible price, capping high-band potential.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    Causal chain is loose: we’re told Kael leaves clues → pretender will come → confrontation occurs, but no on-page cause tightens until the final paragraph. Closure is a soft reveal (verbal rebuke) rather than a Decisive Change with cost; the pretender’s collapse is asserted, not dramatized, so Resonant Reconfiguration is thin. Orientation is clear by paragraph 2, meeting the 120-word test. Lens is Situational; pressure accumulates atmospherically, but the final image doesn’t reweight stakes—it merely confirms what was always assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + data sift builds to a conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maya accepts that some maps must stay missing—yet the cost is only asserted (“mystery still lingered”), not made legible on her body, choices, or future options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric mode. One meaningful tightening occurs when the torn page reframes all prior data, satisfying the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain: abandoned bay → rumor of circle → barefoot climb → hum → reignited purpose. Orientation anchors who/where by line 4; no penalty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “the stars shone bright with possibility” reframes the bay from defeat to launchpad. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the hum solves the problem it didn’t help create, so price feels abstract, capping high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal spine holds: kite → decode → orb → destiny accepted, each step triggered by on-page agency. Closure lands as Charged Poise—golden light bathing Akira while plants chorus—reconfiguring her insurgent role into evolutionary steward; the cost is the irreversible fusion with destiny she can no longer refuse. One scaffold loop (“As she…”) repeats three times mid-arc, dulling propulsion, but no beat is skipped or soft-resolved. Orientation is anchored by sulfur and damp earth within 60 words; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl of stillness reweights the stake and the photograph flattens, a visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from wind-tormented to hush suffices. Orientation anchors (who, when) clear by line 3; lighthouse keeper line is late but functional. Causality is lyric, not because/therefore, allowed under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a lyrical CR: the broken box reweighted as gateway. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of untangling reconfigures perception. No orientation debt; lighthouse library anchor arrives by word 40. However, no causal tightening mid-text; pressure is static mood, not narrowing choice. Cost is conceptual only—acceptable under CR, but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent stance on the ridge reweights the ink patterns into a shared cosmos, cost legible in the “world… unfolding like a map etched in disappearing ink.” Causality is lyric-accumulative; the pattern taught early (ink smudge → ink aura) holds. Orientation is clear by word 80. The missing person’s passivity keeps the beat from tightening further; no decision narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal lens is stable: because she reads the letter, therefore she transmits it, therefore the city’s silence cracks. Orientation is clean—library, snow, pod, within 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Aria watches screens, now “guardian of contraband truths,” a charged poise that re-weights her identity. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; no prop, relationship, or physical price is forfeited on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floral vignette layers tranquility until the final rose reweights the wrecked world outside. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aria asleep inside the dome, sword on wall, roses breathing—whose cost is the perpetual vigilance we infer she’ll face tomorrow; the text only implies, not dramatizes, that price. Orientation is clear by word 60, but the single through-line is static; no tightening reverses her course, merely re-affirmation. Causality is loose: the engraved stone is discovered, then decorative; the inculcation method asserted, never tested under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers hum-silences and star-shifts until the final “feral lullaby” reweights the stake. Orientation is lyric-delayed but pays off at closure, so waiver applies. The missing cost is the flaw: no prior constraint or lost option charges the goddess-echo; the garden simply grants it. Closure lands as Charged Poise, but without a price-tag the beat feels light for elite bar.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Adelaide smiles into the mist clutching the nib, implying the path ahead has been reweighted. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible. Causal chain, however, is thin: no concrete test of the journalist’s claim occurs; the pen nib’s “power” is asserted, never validated or falsified, so the contradiction exercise is outline-only. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity; transitions smooth; escalation mild but present under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of sound → silence, firmware whispers → meteor hush, guilt → release. Closure is a Charged Poise: the meteor hush crystallizes options—she stays in the quiet, needles down, guilt stilled. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the laboratory of lost sounds…”). No causal reversals are required under this lens; the deepening of texture reweights the stake. Cost is the acceptance of an open-ended quiet that forecloses the old haunted cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern density (mandala, mist, whisper cadence) tightens until the lilac light bath re-weights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of “ready to explore”—with conceptual cost (certainties shed). No orientation debt; transitions are implicit mist seepage. One scaffold loop (“world that was slowly coming into focus”) repeats but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaza’s renaming crystallizes her stewardship, cost paid by the retrocognitive grief-flash. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each mosaic fragment layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation clean by word 50. No causal break; ellipsis between “she began to walk” → “until she came to a stop” is motivated by her search for the stepping stone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece lands a soft Charged Poise: the garden stills and the coin glows, implying timeline repair. Yet causality is lyric-metaphorical (“echoes grew louder…timeline began to repair”) rather than a traceable because/therefore chain; cost is atmospheric, not stipulated on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—each sensory layer (scent, tingle, glow) thickens the creative trance—and lands a Charged Poise closure: the dawn-lit painting is a crystallized final image that reweights the stake, with the geode still clutched as undeniable residual cost. Causality is internal but coherent: recall → geode proxy → static jolt → recalibrated sight → new paintings. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3. Minor loop risk: “delicate, glittering shard” and “delicate, glittering beauty” echo, but the closure image is not dulled.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Aria accepts her role amid glowing fungi, an earned stasis that costs nothing new. Causality is loose—heat-mapping produces beauty but no forked path or forfeiture—so the lens drifts lyrical/accumulative rather than causal. Orientation is clear by 60 words, satisfying the 120-word test. No meaningful escalation tightens the stake; the narrative plateaus after the first glow.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of cataloging buttons + canyon echo builds textured density toward CR re-weighting of prophecy. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—warehouse becomes crucible, prophecy now “living narrative”—with conceptual cost legible in final paragraph. Orientation is clear by sentence 3; no teleports. However, escalation is a slow accumulation without a single tightening beat that forecloses an option; risk stays steady, not risen.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ambiguous drive lens settles into Accumulative/Textural: the silver-mist imagery keeps layering until the mirrored self offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—an Earned Stasis where the cost is the lifelong scar she keeps wearing. Orientation is clean within 120 words; transitions are single-scene. Closure lands with felt cost, yet the path to the mirror-self is coincidence-shaped (she simply “finds” the figure) rather than choice-propelled, slightly blunting the because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a lyric “charged poise” image—fog lifting, needle glowing—but the promised “distillation” never materializes as an on-page decision or reveal. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence deepens nicely, yet the palimpsest idea stays metaphorical; nothing is literally overwritten or re-interpreted for reader or coachman. Cost is only atmospheric (patience, mist); no option is foreclosed or re-priced. Thus the resonance feels asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oasis stays dead yet “resists change” via residual kindness, a pleasing inversion that carries conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thrumming, honey scent, smoke—but the causality between sun-pattern etchings and timeline “alignment” is asserted, not demonstrated, blunting the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: moonlit harbor, oar-rhythm, and tooth accrete toward a Charged Poise closure—urban tranquility wrapped round by felt vigilance. Transitions are smooth (one scene, one POV); time/space anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying Orientation. Closure image (“fire escape gardener stood as a guardian…”) reconfigures stakes—city’s beauty now contingent on hidden caretaking—conceptual cost legible. No causal reversal, but pattern break (dawn after hush) is sufficient under Accumulative drive; cost is oblique yet undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sundial’s glint becomes a “promise,” reconfiguring isolation into forward duty with felt but conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light/shadow, hum, and memory layers until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchor-complete by line 3; no penalty. Escalation is modest—one cadence shift—yet sufficient under lyric design; lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: image-density rises from cloud-burst to prismatic quiet, reweighting the stake from isolation to communal weave. Closure is a Charged Poise: the temple’s glint and the twig in hand reconfigure meaning without declarative payoff. Cost is conceptual—she now carries the pattern, not merely observes it. One soft transition (watching artists arrive) is legible and patterned early.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine holds: because Lyra tunes the sub-sonic band, she detects the pattern, therefore she can jam the tricksters, and the disturbances fade. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 60. The decisive change lands on-page—the counter-signal goes out and the community calms—but the cost is purely external (reports dwindle) rather than a felt price paid by Lyra, so the closure flirts with but does not reach Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. No persistent constraint or lingering consequence shapes the final image, keeping the victory lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands: crystal reweights her perception, claustrophobia dissolves, cost = impossible return. Causal chain is thin—organ music, crystal, cosmic vision arrive as gifts rather than because/therefore—but the Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words. One soft teleporter: compass pick becomes skeleton key without setup.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft CR: final image of “world…a little brighter” reweights premise, but cost is abstract rather than felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shifts via mist and ribbon reprise, yet no concrete consequence is risked or forfeited on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: final image of “great unknown” reweights stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—dread thickens by iterative motif rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 120 w; no teleporting props. Mild causality gap: reversible exile rule never tightens options on-page, only reframed as theme.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration—music fades, fiddler disappears, world is “forever changed”—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the piece holds: fog lifts, flake glows, scaffold pattern reveals, music answers. Yet the tightening is all cadence, no consequential choice; the pixelated amnesty is announced but never complicates tactics. Thus the ending satisfies the lens yet feels weightless because no option is actually foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the foreign money reweights “value” under the dusky sky with quiet cost. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of territorial markers deepens meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is clean by line 3; single transition (train → night road) is legible. No meaningful tightening mid-text; density plateaus after the money discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece layers repetitions of “shared burdens” and starlight until a dawn reconfiguration arrives. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3 and hold; orientation test waived. Closure is present as Charged Poise—Lyra’s stance crystallizes in the final image of daylight entering the dome, reweighting the night’s work. Cost is diffuse (“eyes tired”) but felt; lens coherence holds, so the uplift lands, albeit gently.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: orchard vortex, serpent-trees, and mirror-cracks layer sensory density toward the conceptual reprice at closure. Orientation anchored by 120 words; however, the causal spine is weak—ice shatters because the druid “reaches out,” not via any prior constraint or tactic, so the decisive change feels administered rather than earned. Closure image (mirror’s cracked glimpse into soul) lands as resonant reconfiguration, but cost is asserted (“shook the druid to their core”) not dramatized, blunting legibility under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—Aria glimpses “infinite possibilities” and chooses to walk on—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: repeated lyrical pulses (“cobalt hue,” “wildflowers,” “ethereal scars”) deepen mood rather than narrow options. No concrete constraint survives the final line, so the reconfiguration feels weightless. Orientation is clear by word 60; lens holds, yet the ending’s conceptual price isn’t made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: spell complete, destiny rewoven, orchard transformed; cost is conceptual but legible in the final glow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (roots, bones, card, corridor-light) intensifies stake until final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Slight causal softening: how inlaying meaning rewrites fate rules is never constrained, so the price feels unbounded rather than rule-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers memory fragments against present stillness until the final cadence reframes silence as possibility. Closure is a CR—silence repriced from suffocation to symphony—visible in the last line, but the cost is abstract, not tethered to an on-page renunciation or concrete stakes. The grille cloth callback supplies the reweighting, yet the story never tests his appraiser skills or risks failure, so the tightening is tonal rather than tactical. Orientation is clear; transitions are smooth; causality stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “physics of transition” is declared grasped, but the conceptual cost is only asserted (“she felt a deep sense of connection”). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mist/seed/light—but the final reweighting is told, not imaged, so the cost lacks legible charge. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical loops of tide/moon imagery build texture rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift and clear; space, time, POV stable. Closure is Charged Poise: final tableau crystallizes “wonder in routine” but no new constraint or price is legible—librarian simply continues. Thus cost is only atmospheric, not actionable.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a soft epiphany (“she knew that she would carry the pearl’s latent radiance”) without on-page Decisive Change or felt cost; the lens drifts from causal to purely textural. Setup anchors place by word 50, but causality stalls: no because/therefore links between touching pearl → hearing shell → deciding to “illuminate the world.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ivy station, graffiti mantra, and accordion motif layer until the final lament reweights “forgiveness is a map” with lived cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara walks on, path unsealed, guilt lighter, accordion creak audible—cost is felt in the lingering note. Setup-to-payoff is tight; map and bellows are introduced by line 6 and reprised in the final paragraph. Orientation clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing: the library is recast as a “state of being,” giving the ending a modest lift. However, the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and the sole escalation is a density increase (more whispers, more mist) rather than a causal narrowing; the watch’s “propagation delays” are alluded to but never operationalized to alter tactics. Orientation is clear by 120 words, but the mid-story pivot relies on a piece of paper that teleports into the dreamer’s hand—an unmotivated prop appearance that slightly bruises causality. Cost is poetically implied yet not visibly paid on the page, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical repetitions (“velvet,” “midsummer,” “threads”) tighten mood toward Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clear by 50 words; one soft causality gap—the empire’s concrete threat is never instantiated, so the final “step into the unknown” feels more mood than decisive change, though poetic cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via the aurora–emerald refraction pattern and held to a resonant CR: the chip’s glow reweights oblivion into transcendent preservation. One seam—why this heirloom matters—is elided, but the final image pays undeniable conceptual cost. Closure is legible and charged; minor causality gap keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: lyrical loops of “vineyard hush” and rebirth imagery substitute for causal tightening. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; stakes (find contentment) are declared but never challenged on-page. Closure is a static epiphany—“she realized”—rather than a reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is clear, yet the plot drifts in reflective summary, breaking the because/therefore chain required under Causal default.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the conscience tucks the shard away, acknowledging cost without decisive change. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because the wind-chime “method” is opaque; the unhooking happens in narration, not in a beat we can trace. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the drive lens stays loose—pattern taught only by repetition of abstract nouns—so the tightening required for 8+ is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft CR: the student’s “understanding” reweights the premise, but the cost is off-loaded onto the student rather than paid by the protagonist. Causality is lyric-accumulative; ripples and starlight pattern toward recognition, yet no beat narrows the researcher’s options or forces a renunciation. The piece meets the 600–800 word default, single scene, single POV, and orientation is clear by word 60, so no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered dust, circling birds, and vibrational hum accrete toward a Charged Poise. Closure—the skimmer’s pulse syncing with the canyon—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is poetic assertion (“almost palpable”) rather than a visceral forfeiture shown on-page. Causality is loose: the arrowhead pattern-reading does not tighten options or risk, it merely deepens mood. Still, the piece teaches its lyrical pattern early and honors it at the end, satisfying the mosaic track’s bare requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain: discovery → mist-walk → unstrap → luminance → renewal; each step follows, but pressure is light—no obstacle, deadline, or antagonistic force. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the “brilliant dimness” reweights her stance toward simplicity. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the story never endangers her goal or reputation, so the tightening feels gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation lands early and the causal path is simple: curiosity → find book → look out window → see truth. Wandering-as-signification is the only beat that meaningfully advances knowledge, and it’s under-motivated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“he would never see the world the same”), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Lens holds as an Accumulative/Textural drift, yet the tightening is single-thread and thin.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (drinking the droplet reweights the prophecy), but the cost is purely assertion (“wavelength align with purpose”). No prior constraint or price shapes tactics; distillation success is smooth, not a tightening. Causal lens is weak because static-decoding success is immediate and opposition-free.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the atlas page emptied, the reaper vanished, the observatory left “a sentinel… of the forgotten.” The cost is conceptual—the reaper’s eternal solitude re-weighted—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each echoed image thickens until the final dissipation reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single-scene default is met. The missing beat is a mid-course tightening that forecloses an option; the escalation is purely density-driven, so the ending feels inevitable yet not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drip and color wash layers density toward the bell’s toll. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the toll reweights the world, but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. No constraint or price sticks to the mage afterward, softening the ache that high-band stories demand. Still, the pattern is legible and complete within its lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each photograph adds mournful density, ending in a Charged Poise (“silence seemed to vibrate with the promise of stories”). Orientation clear by line 4. Yet no decisive tightening or trade-off appears—the trail never finds the “forgotten memory,” so closure is atmospheric, not consequential. Cost is felt but not priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical accretion of orchard detail, starling murmurations, and crystal mist build toward a Charged Poise closure where “boundaries between reality and magic” feel fluid. Causality is loose—crystal activation does not tighten options, only intensifies perception—yet the cadence shift satisfies the RR test with felt conceptual cost: knowledge that harmony is “within reach” but not possessed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure is valid under Accumulative rules.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the stake of “map or fail.” Closure is Charged Poise—dawn erases the patterns she’s captured, so the cost is the irretrievability of the data she now carries alone. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Buckle callback at end reweights trust burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaito leaves the dojo “fully alive,” a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the identity crisis. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through mirrored imagery (brain / self) until a cadence shift releases tension. Causality is soft; the meditation practice is named but never shows a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Cost is felt but diffuse; the final peace is stated more than paid for with a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reverie layer deepens the seed’s symbolic density until it catalyzes the new-room concept. Orientation is swift—who/where/when locked by line 3—and the single scene stays contiguous. The meaningful tightening is the dawn realization that reconfigures her professional path; the cost is opportunity/energy spent overnight, felt but not foregrounded. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the absence of a visible constraint or forfeiture keeps it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure is a gentle resonance rather than decisive change: the household feels laughter, but no on-page rule or option is reweighted. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; because/therefore links are implied, not traced. The “final grain slips through the hourglass” is repeated verbatim, a loop that dulls the pivot moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant glows, mist reclaims her, stance crystallizes. Causality is lyric-accumulative: mist thickens → visions → re-perception → poise; linkage is atmospheric, not beat-by-beat. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens contradiction. However, the decisive reconfiguration relies on visionary summary rather than a tangible cost or constraint shown to alter tactics, keeping it below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is legible under a Causal lens: broken crozier → distillation experiment → energy crescendo → new creation. The penny-drop moment lands as a Decisive Change with a visible new object, satisfying closure. However, the experiment’s risk is declared rather than staged—no mid-process setback, resource loss, or error—so the cost feels conceptual, not lived. Orientation is clear by word 50; no teleporting props or logic breaks, but the lack of causal friction caps the score below the 8.8+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: repeated motifs (star shard, hush, moonlight) accrue symbolic weight until the final “gateway” reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; spatial logic holds. Causality, however, is loose—revelations arrive via atmospheric osmosis rather than because/therefore links. Closure lands as Charged Poise, but the cost is abstract (“wonder and awe”) rather than lived or irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece is an atmospheric vignette, not a causal plot: no “because/therefore” escalates; the discovery of grotto symbols is a reveal, not a reversal that narrows options. Closure is a mood-state (“she stepped into the unknown”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost; the lens remains Accumulative/Textural, but no density shift or pattern break re-weights stakes, so the ending feels open, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present as a Charged Poise: the final image of the thread trailing like an “umbilical cord” reweights the premise, making the gallery a living pattern she can re-enter. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Causality, however, is weak—gallery reacts because “she wove,” not because a prior choice forced a narrowing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and color swell, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is felt but conceptual rather than tactical, keeping the ending lyric, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece follows an accumulative-textural lens: repeated star/anchor images tighten the stake “humanity must re-see its place,” culminating in Charged Poise as the students disperse beneath “unfurled canvas” sky. The chain-link reprise is elegant, but the ending’s conceptual cost is only asserted (“universe full of mysteries”), not dramatized—no option is foreclosed for Lyra. Orientation anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying the 120-word test.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Aria stays on-duty, the woman leaves healed, the hearing-aid hum continues—cost is the endless task itself, faint but legible. Causality is soft: the sister’s appearance is coincidence, not Aria’s tactic; the clearing mist is atmospheric confirmation, not consequence. Orientation clears by word 60; no lens drift. One non-closure flaw: the “decades-old hearing aid” is introduced as already-working magic without prior cause or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she surfaces clutching the codex, bearing the cables’ roar inside her—cost is legible. Causal chain wobbles: gold-fleck lock is announced, then the fleck is “in the margins,” so the door should never have opened for her; the beat is elided. Orientation clean by 120 words; spatial logic holds. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through tidal cadence and humming cables; one meaningful tightening suffices and is present.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    Drive lens is lyric-accumulative: ink patterns and ghost fragments layer texture until the final image reweights solitude. Orientation is swift; causality is associative, not causal—ghost emergence feels like snow-assisted epiphany rather than a because/therefore sequence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: shard released into dawn hush, solitude crystallized, cost felt in the hush itself. Lens holds, but the lack of a tightening turn keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reweights the diamond from curse to catalyst and certifies that a new language now haunts the canyon—an undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each paragraph adds choral density until the cadence itself becomes the new lexicon. Orientation is satisfied by “In the canyon…” at word 9. The single weakness: no mid-text tightening beat where failure looms; escalation is smooth accretion rather than a visible fork.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise: Lena exits with “frostbitten hope,” a crystallized stance toward the untamed harmony. Yet the cost is atmospheric, not on-page—she sacrifices nothing, loses nothing, and no persistent constraint shapes later tactics. Causality is accumulative/textural: static voices accumulate pattern but never tighten options; the arrowhead resonance repeats rather than reverses. Orientation is clear by 120 words, but the lens remains situational pressure without a decisive turn that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present: statues physically change, orchard glows—Decisive Change with faint sensory cost. Causality, however, is magical hand-waving: music → instant awakening, no intermediate obstacles or price paid by Luna. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is a single sweep rather than tightening. Orientation is clear early; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is slim but intact: curiosity → covert crossing → hand-off; closure lands as “small step toward healing,” a Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier talk of promises. The “linking absences” gimmick is asserted rather than shown and never tested under pressure, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Cost is soft—no concrete forfeiture on page—holding it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn + finished horse + memory of singer reconfigure meaning, but the cost is only implied (“memory would remain”). Causal chain is loose—wrong turn feels author-engineered, not driven by carpenter’s prior choice. Orientation clean by 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Halo fragment returns as gentle glow but never tests or limits action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cumulative-textural lens holds cleanly: each dawn session thickens the sensory archive (“the photographs and paintings…held within them the very fabric”) and the final sentence crystallizes a Charged Poise where the endless pursuit is accepted at visible cost—“the journey…ever beckoning.” No orientation debt, no causal gaps; the ellipsis between days is motivated by the ritual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is present: the ribbon falls, the idea is released, the clearing is “forever changed” — a light CR that reweights the world. But the causal chain is thin; the star-hint is decorative rather than a mechanism that forecloses options, so the cost is only atmospheric. Orientation is clear within 120 words, lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers sensorial echoes (damp earth, broken constellations, fairy ring glow) until the final “crisp nostalgia” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: options narrowed to “follow the thread,” cost felt in the mushroom’s pulse and the orchard’s sentinel wrecks. Causality is atmospheric, not event-based, which fits the lens but keeps the tightening gentle. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the archivist’s “quiet triumph” reweights the shard-mirror and library hush, satisfying the CR test under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality, however, is loose—“the leaves… seemed to hold the key” substitutes seeming for agency, and the reversal of exile is asserted, not dramatized. TheOrientation Test is met by line 4, but the beat structure is repetitive (successive “As…” clauses) rather than because/therefore linked.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lush cadence piles up without causal linkage; each paragraph restates the same beat—Aria restores life—so no tightening occurs. The heirloom seed is introduced and deployed in the same sentence; no obstacle or option is foreclosed. Closure is a Charged Poise (“threshold” image) but the cost is zero; the world simply becomes “more wondrous.” Orientation is clear, yet the pattern is circular description, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final stillness visibly reframes the sanctuary and her mission. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silence and color mounts until the cadence shifts—and holds cleanly. Orientation is clear within 50 words; no causal fractures. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, so the beat feels slightly weightless, but the effect lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal lens: the henge comparison yields new knowledge (“subtle patterns”) that changes Elara’s stance, satisfying the closure requirement. Orientation is clean by word 60. However, escalation is flat—no tightening beat narrows options or raises price; revelation arrives as observation, not friction. Cost is conceptual (she now “carries the whispers”) but not dramatized on-page; hence ceiling 6.8.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emptied snow-globe and reframed adage “to let go is not to release, but to reframe” visibly reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each artifact—logbook, net, globe—accrues until the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable cost: the globe is hollowed, the library left dark. Causality is lyric rather than plot-engine; the pattern is taught early and paid off in a single cadence shift that tightens stakes without a conventional twist. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) surface within the first 120 words; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural finished, the plate pocketed, the gentle ozone breeze signals the ghost’s reciprocity—cost is the irreversible thinning of her everyday boundary. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each charcoal stroke thickens textural density until the final image re-weights the courtyard as co-authored space. Orientation anchors (who, when) are lyrically delayed but taught by ~100 words and payoff at exit, so no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ascent and diary pages accrue density until the shrine chamber crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara folds the page, the goggles glow—reconfiguring the spire from prison to sanctuary with felt conceptual cost. The lens holds; no orientation debt. Light-diary decryption is taught early and repaid in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure reaches Charged Poise: the final image of “dusty starlight” reweights the stake of memorializing storms, and the cost is the solitude of that calling. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cloud-emotion mapping tightens through repetition until the final crystallization. Orientation is clear by word 50; no causality breaks, yet the tightening is mild—one cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portrait glows while machines wait, reweighting the infinite/finite stakes. Causality is accumulative: each sensory layer (dappled light → coin indentations → brushstrokes) tightens the same thematic vise rather than chaining because/therefore turns. Orientation is clean by word 60; the demolition clock is a persistent constraint. The cost is legible in the final image – the sky trapped inside doomed bark – satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a declared future intention (“Eli knew that they were ready to set course”) rather than an on-page decisive change or charged poise; no option is foreclosed and no cost is felt. The luminance map is completed but never tested against reality, so the story ends in forecast, not reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael stands inside the mirrored hall, newly perceiving cosmic harmony; cost is conceptual (the fragility of time) rather than felt. The causal chain is thin: finding the gear diagram → following its replica → door opens; no setback or resource spent. Orientation is clear by ~60 words, yet the midpoint lacks a meaningful tightening—progress is steady, not narrowed. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the mirror hall lands, but the absence of a price anchor keeps it shy of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece is a lyrical montage, not a causal plot; the chalk messages function as oracle-ex-machina, eliminating protagonist agency. Closure is a mood-shift—“the planet’s energy signature began to shift”—rather than a decisive change paid for by anyone. Because no character’s options narrow, the ending fails the cost test under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Situational lens holds: coherent pressure = dying daylight + hush-field that demands stance crystallization. The closure is a Charged Poise: adjuster finishes calibration, whispers lullaby, and the hush thickens into living membrane—cost is the eternal vigilance legible in the shimmering pane. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 w, taught by glass-pane frame. No causality breaks; luck complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is linear: nut→memory→blueprint→reactivation→rescue. Each step follows, but pressure is external (night frost deadline) rather than a narrowing of options; the “graceless beauty” lens is named only at the end. Closure lands as Charged Poise—glowing path, grateful travelers—but cost is off-loaded onto anonymous strangers, not the caretaker.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative lens: foam → fiber insight → emotional reframe. Closure is a gentle Charged Poise, but the cost is only asserted (“grief began to lift”) not dramatized; no path is actually foreclosed. The river-foam mechanic is taught early and echoed at end, satisfying pattern coherence. Orientation is clear by line 4, transitions are smooth, yet escalation is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: refracted light, slow-moving clouds, and hush layer into the final Charged Poise where “stories begin” reweights the library itself. The bottle is the single tightening agent; its shimmer escalates density rather than narrows causal options, fitting the lyric mode. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she will never see the world the same—but the absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as an Accumulative/Textural Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion tide subsides and Elara’s stance crystallizes with peace. Orientation is clean; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Causality is lyric-pattern rather than because/therefore; the tidal pool → pavilion drift is coherent under the dream lens. Cost is felt but diffuse—“the memories would always be there”—without a pinpoint image or forfeiture, so the price reads conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece accumulates texture rather than causal beats; the central “conversation” with the elevator is lyrically charged but changes nothing on-page—no option is foreclosed, no knowledge altered. Closure is a soft sunrise smile, not an Earned Stasis or Decisive Change. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image needs a sharper reweighting of stakes; instead it diffuses into generalized hope.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The causal spine is “mirror broken → mirror fixed → memories pour in”; escalation is purely additive (more fragments re-assembled, more memories seen) rather than option-narrowing. Closure is a soft “she knew she was ready,” a summary assertion without visible cost or decisive change. No constraint or price is left on the page; she could walk away unchanged. Orientation is clear early; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern never tightens—just accumulates description.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the seeds of vigilance shift from metaphor to cultivatable force—yet the cost is only named (“responsibility that came with knowledge”), not felt. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: each beat adds density until the alcove reweights the premise. However, the manuscript doodle teleports in as a fully-formed map rather than being earned through deduction, blunting the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each strum thickens texture until the porcelain’s integration reweights the sculpture’s meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—grove and reader left vibrating in “quiet heartbeat”—with felt cost (the sculptor’s solitary departure). Orientation is clear by line 4; the hedgehog event remains abstract but functions as mythic caesura, not causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a lyrical CR: the tutor walks off re-enchanted, the magnetic nexus reframed as beacon. Cost is conceptual—acceptance of exile—not dramatized through a decisive choice or forfeiture on this beat. Causality is accumulative/textural: silence-translation method accrues mood until the final poise. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 50 words, satisfying the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a lyric Charged Poise: the diary’s silence harmonizes with Elara’s frequencies, reweighting empathy as communal resonance. Causal linkage is weak—why the clasp yields now is unexplained—but the Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent: each sensory layer thickens the silence until it crystallizes. Orientation is faultless; anchors arrive within 40 words. The “fireworks” clock is poetic but never tightens tactics; still, the final hush before their detonation gives the image undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical layering of scent/images builds to Charged Poise at bloom. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure lands—“wildflower hush” reweights premise—but cost is only conceptual, not felt; no constraint persists. Pattern taught early, transitions legible, lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the glowing pool re-prices the orchard’s resilience as a planetary “gathering of echoes,” giving Lyra—and the reader—a new conceptual frame with implicit cost (she can never possess the energy, only witness it). Causal chain is thin—discovery happens by following accelerated growth rather than by a hard choice—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation in first 120 w is firm: pilot, orchard planet, countdown. No lens contradiction; the shift from tech mission to mystical insight is telegraphed by the arrow tip’s unexplained vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she drives away feeling “determination” but no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Wind-pattern survey is set up yet yields no causal consequence; the patch never changes her tactics. Orientation clear by ~80 words, but lens slips between Accumulative (textural repetition) and Situational (static stance); neither lands with cost. No tightening or deepening beat—only iterative noticing—so escalation stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cavern’s hush is “unfettered,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—the singer leaves emptied yet luminous. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices at this length, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the silent flute glowing reweights prior material and the cost is the canyon hush she now carries inside. Causality is accumulative/textural; the pattern of “sound → vision → stillness” tightens once and lands cleanly, but the driftwood markers appear only at the end, so the payoff is partly unearned. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene causality holds: Halo fragment → press → disorienting print, each beat legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—stars gone, reality rewritten, “true work beginning.” Cost is cosmic, not personal; lacking a visible/private price keeps it from 8-band. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece lands a lyric Charged Poise closure: the pendant’s final hum reweights the earlier encounters as communal germination, a resonant reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens. Causality is loose—beats accrete mood rather than tighten options—yet the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last image, satisfying the accumulative contract. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity; cost is felt as wistful afterglow rather than concrete forfeiture, keeping the score just short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held: frost patterns and mist build density toward a conceptual reweighting. The “truthful lies” closure offers a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is abstract—no concrete forfeiture on the page. Cause–effect linkage is loose; revelation arrives by contemplative drift rather than driven beat. Orientation is clear by 120 w; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of loom + puzzle fragments accreting meaning until the final “bridge” image reweights stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—threads become bridge, silence becomes conduit—cost is conceptual but legible in the glow of the amber bead. Orientation clear by ~70 words; no transitions or shard breaks, stays within single-scene default. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore; acceptable under Accumulative mode and holds to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sword gleams, the cycle restarts with the apprentice, and the cost is the blacksmith’s relinquishing of solitude—felt in the single line “my solitude was about to be broken.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat adds density—silk, forge, mines, arches—until the final image crystallizes the transformation-of-rubble theme. One soft loop: “the sound of hammering echoed through the valleys once more” restates the opening echo without new pressure, a minor cadence redundancy. Orientation is clean by word 60; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is present—she re-enters home bay with irreversible knowledge—but the causal chain is fuzzy: the shard’s rules, doorway timing, and her agency inside the weave are all asserted, not demonstrated. Orientation is waived yet lens stays Accumulative/Textural; however, the lack of a visible cost or constraint in the final beat keeps the reconfiguration lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the glowing glass reweights the earlier found object and crystallizes the skipper’s commitment under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is light—stone-stacking calms but does not tighten options—and the anonymous-letter threat is introduced then abandoned, so escalation is more mood accretion than because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is present but diffuse (emotional “ache”), not a concrete constraint that shapes later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sunrise is conceptually repriced by her unseen ritual labor—“the dawn was taking shape, a new reality coalescing from the darkness”—and the cost is the eternal recurrence she embraces, felt in the echo of laughter that “would linger until the next dawn.” Causality is accumulative/textural: each lantern adjustment adds luminescent density until the stars fade; no single beat reverses plot, but the pattern’s cadence tightens the stake. Orientation is immediate—emerald lighthouse, starry sky, alone—and never drifts; transitions are smooth. The lens ambiguity guardrail is waived because the accumulative pattern is taught early and holds through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored light deepens the stake of “seeing” rather than causal because/therefore chains. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image of drifting darkness re-weights the earlier iridescent caution with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity. Slight cap because the escalation is one-note (only light play) and the cost is conceptual rather than felt in body or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.0)
    Closure is present—the sextant is whole and the worker’s sorrow “dissipate[s]”—but the decisive change is causally opaque: moonlight healing is asserted rather than earned. The pin-drop moment is decorative; it does not tighten options or reweight stakes. Because the lens is lyric-accumulative, a Resonant Reconfiguration could suffice, yet the ending image reprises the same soft lunar glow already used three times, so no new charge lands. Conceptual cost is missing: nothing is foreclosed, and the tower-trees-moon web remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a restatement of hope, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative lens chosen: images repeat but never tighten options or reweight meaning. Orientation clear, yet no causal or pattern turn charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile detail (dust, lantern glow, worn gold title) layers density until the midnight quarter-hour tightens cadence. Orientation is clean by line 4; causality is loose but permissible under this lens—escalation is tonal compression, not option reduction. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invitation tucked back into the pocket reconfigures failure into possibility with conceptual cost visible. The missing causal trigger for the original mistake keeps this from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final walk-off smile reweights prior pattern, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural (image-return of bread/tea/garden) and the cost is only conceptual—“tenuous absolution” is named, not paid. Causality is loose: bread appears, gardener appears, repeated return visits accumulate texture; no because/therefore narrows options. Orientation anchor is met by word 40; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building cadence that reweights the stake via density of archival fragments. Closure is a lyric Earned Stasis—Elara returns the slide, her quiet exit foreclosing further search—but the cost is only atmospheric, not dramatized on her body or choice. Causality is loose: the lantern never forces a real fork, and “sampling frequencies” is named late, never tripping her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunrise light and the unbroken gaze re-weight the market’s fragile peace with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—fob purchase triggers hush, stare-down sustains it—but the lens tilts Accumulative; the tightening is more atmospheric than consequential, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is soft: the stranger’s handshake delivers an instant, abstract “surge of understanding” rather than a visible Decisive Change or tangible cost.  Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural – aurora, lavender, forest-election myth build texture until a final cadence shift – but the intensification is atmospheric coincidence, not because/therefore causality.  Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, yet the forest-election rule is introduced so late it never perturbs tactics; it remains ornamental.  The ring’s pull is the only constraint, but it functions like a polite magnet rather than a price that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lock’s crystalline gleam reweights the premise—creation rectifies both artist and object. Causality is soft (“as if the act of creating had somehow rectified…”) but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: each stroke thickens emotional density until the cave hums back. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by word 60; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the shredded map layers build density toward the “repository” image. Orientation is clean by word 60; causality is loose—finding the plate is chance, the chamber unlocks without resistance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gilded scripts re-weight Aria’s art, but the cost is conceptual, not felt on her body or ink. One transition (surface→undercroft) is legible; the pattern holds, yet the absence of a constraint that shapes tactics keeps it short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sculpture becomes the bluff’s new transmitter, crystallizing the post-verbal era with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each seasonal paragraph thickens texture until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift and the mosaic pattern is taught early, but the price is more declarative than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine holds: magnetic shift → burn → Aria’s decision to contain rather than flee. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she is still an android, still caretaking, but the dome now “less confining.” The cost is present yet soft: the box is lighter, the flames already spent. One causality bump: management announces the burn off-stage, so the stakes arrive pre-packaged rather than forced by Aria’s discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft CR—the note “To those who listen” reweights the locket’s meaning—but the absence of any felt cost to Emilia keeps it shy of Resonant Reconfiguration. The mailbox mystery resolves off-stage via the writer’s confession; the because-chain between Emilia’s investigation and the emotional payoff is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dice glow, the door opens, and the web/image reweights her stance with felt cost; causality is thin—no concrete obstacle is overcome—but the lyric pattern holds and the lens (Accumulative) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds atmospheric density until the crystal delivers a conceptual repricing. Closure lands—a blue-lit crystalline refraction of memory—but the cost is conceptual, not dramatized on the body or future choice, so the “felt” test is barely met. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the whale’s causal role remains symbolic rather than operative, slightly blurring the tightening logic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated images of night hush, origami light, and water drift accumulate toward a final “tranquil blaze.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—the crane’s glowing glide reweights the preceding silence—but the cost is only atmospheric; no concrete constraint or forfeiture is made legible. Orientation is clear within 60 words, but causality is loose: the prophecy is never given substance, so “mapping silence” can’t be tested or fail. The ritual succeeds exactly as intended, so the narrative arc is a straight line with a decorative flicker at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clear—borrowed sugar → weekly lessons → meteor climax → seal transfer—and orientation anchors within 120 words. Closure lands as soft Conceptual Repricing: the seal now glows with shared “agreed-upon lies,” a legible before/after for the student. Cost is present (tutor relinquishes heirloom, student accepts worldview shift) but muted; no persistent constraint shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell’s silence and dawn light reweight her stance toward independence. Causality is thin—decoding whispers via “resonance structures” is hand-waved, so the memory release feels magical rather than earned. Orientation is clear by word 60, satisfying the single-scene window. One meaningful tightening occurs when whispers become intelligible memories, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the new text “unlinked” and the aurora’s glow reweights meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of parchment/rose/key imagery peaks in the final pearl-twilight glow, making cost felt conceptually. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The stalactite drip supplies a coherent cadence shift, tightening once. Persistent constraint (the heirloom key) shapes every textual move, though its mechanics remain metaphoric rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aria stands in “still and vibrant” silence, the shell quiet in her palm, the cost of her song felt in the hush that follows. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical return of “echo,” “web,” “hum” thickens the mood until the final cadence reweights it. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, acceptable under the lens. The price is atmospheric, not tactical, so the effect is resonant but not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the empty globe reframes the “windows of connection” motif, and the glacier shrine’s glow provides felt cost—she leaves carrying absence. Causality, however, is loose: vision arrives because she touches, not because she chooses or errs; the because/therefore linkage is weak under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty, but the plot never tightens—each beat is another luminous tableau rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as soft Charged Poise: the moon-lit clearing image reweights earlier motifs (whisk, fireflies, parapet) with quiet conceptual cost—she now “sees” hidden effort. Causality is accumulative/textural; the walk accumulates sensory echoes rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no lens ambiguity. However, the decisive tightening is muted—no option is foreclosed on-page, only contemplated.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is linear but intact: shredded letters → stillpoint location → arrival. Closure lands as Charged Poise (the pulsing glow reconfigures Aria’s world-view) with visible cost implied by the ominous watch-feeling. However, the orientation anchor is late (~150 words) and the liquidation’s engineered cover-up is told in summary rather than seeded early, breaking tight causality. The stillpoint rules are introduced only at the end, so the payoff feels conveniently revealed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure is declarative summary, not an on-page image or action; the “new dawn” is asserted rather than reweighted. Causality is replaced by iterative recap (“As the days turned into weeks…”), so the lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift delivers cost. The final paragraph simply restates the premise, failing the Resonant Reconfiguration test. Orientation is clear, but the story never tightens—only dilates.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn light → music-box → sound-jar → poem drafts build density toward the “lonesome splendor” Charged Poise. Closure is legible—the loft becomes sanctuary, isolation reframed as guardianship—but the cost is abstract (time lost, not a concrete option foreclosed). Orientation clean at ~80 words; no causal break, yet no persistent constraint that reshapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the artifact’s frequency locks to the marina, the cost framed by fading sunlight and the engineer’s exhale—felt, visible, irrevocable; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of sensory beats cresting into resonance), taught early and held without causal gaps, satisfying the 9+ gate though the tightening is single rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful change or cost lands on the page: the viaduct hums, the moon sets, and the mapper walks back—identical to her arrival. The causal chain is purely associative (moon → viaduct glow → revolution declared) without any tightening of options or knowledge. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the texture never reweights the stake; the ending image repeats the opening atmosphere without reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s brighter shine plus rain-soaked emergence reweight the stake with felt cost. Causal linkage is thin—empirical observation is named, not shown, so the turn rests on atmospheric rise rather than because/therefore. Orientation is clear by 60 words; no penalty. Single-scene default met; no mosaic drift. Lens ambiguity by midpoint costs −0.3; accumulative reading holds at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the music box crystallizes a new pastoral stance, and the rhythmic ticking reweights the premise. Yet the lens is shaky—early beats read accumulative (textural reverie) while the ending insists causal (“therefore he returns renewed”). Orientation is clear, but the decisive cost is only asserted (“ready to face challenges”) rather than dramatized, keeping the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through kaleidoscope images and workshop decay that reweights stakes toward beauty-in-decay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the unheard bell’s harmony re-visions the corroding workshop—but the cost is only declarative (“she felt an odd sense of wonder”) rather than tactile or irreversible. Causality is loose: transliteration simply succeeds after iterative looking; no beat narrows options or risks failure, so tension stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the 4-1-5-9 pattern intensifies like a digital dripping tap, re-weighting the stake each time it surfaces. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—“the files were not deleted, they were simply archived”—a quiet reversal that reconfigures Lena’s void into custodial wonder; the cost is the irrevocable awareness that memory is never truly lost, only hidden, and she must keep tending it.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images (orchard, mirrors, crystal) layer density until the final blue glow reweights empathy from abstract to tactile. Causality is soft—mirrors never explain why they hold the pattern—but the pattern is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise: the ice “sighs,” balance maintained at visible cost. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) is clear by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: crystal assembly shifts her stance from passive watcher to active balancer. Closure beat carries felt cost: “gentle pulse against her heart” + slowed floes = undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator stands on the ice, parasol in hand, accepting fragility while hearing “approaching endings.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned cold imagery and solace motif reweight the stake from suicide to attentive living. Causality is loose (why relief work heals is asserted, not shown), but the final image does reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sentinel’s new “task” is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mismatches intensifies—but the final tightening is summary. No persistent constraint or price is locked to her future action. Causality holds, yet the ending beat is too abstract to reach high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a gentle mood shift, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the walker ends in the same psychic place he began, now merely “knowing” he will tend the clearing. Causality is lyrical-accumulative, but the single beat—listen, weave, absorb—never tightens or forecloses an option, so no cost is legible. The kinetic parapet glows, but this image does not reweight the premise or the walker’s future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is Accumulative/Textural: static lyric tableaux build mood until a Charged Poise closes on the glowing empty map case. Location and POV are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. However, the only escalation is the sun setting and vines continuing to climb—external, not protagonist-driven. Closure lands as a resonant image but no causal constraint or cost is legible; Luna loses nothing, forfeits nothing, and faces no fork.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal’s glint reframes the scholar’s stance, surrendering seclusion with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world… ready to listen”). Causal chain is thin—summons arrives ex machina—but the accumulative pattern of silence → testimony holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is legible: fog density, chalk wear, and driftwood pattern build toward a resonant re-configuration in which “the sound of growing older” is felt rather than found. Orientation is established early (prophet, fog garden, gravel underfoot), satisfying the 120-word window. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern dissolves into fog yet she carries the “echo” inward—cost is conceptual (acceptance of intangibility) rather than tangible. No meaningful tightening or escalation beat narrows options; the piece drifts more than accelerates, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the still hand reweights escape velocity into transcendence of self. Causality is loose—tremors appear without trigger, and the hand’s stop is externally decreed rather than earned by Eli’s action. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap −0.6 for soft causality and off-stage resolution of the quake.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is achieved: the lullaby delivers an Earned Stasis—Emma’s peaceful death with Lena still humming—whose cost is the lingering scent of hope Lena must keep breathing. Causality is light but intact: the blood-work news triggers the goodbye song, and the shard of vinyl re-appears as emotional anchor. Orientation is clear within 50 words; the haven’s cloud-top location is flagged early. However, escalation is textural, not causal—no narrowing options, only deepening mood—so the lens is Accumulative; under that lens one intensification suffices, but the beat remains a single note of tenderness rather than a tightening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is loose: the heirloom key is present but never narratively tested or turned; closure depends on a metaphoric leap (“key as metaphor for cosmic order”) rather than a visible decisive change. Accumulated pattern of star-study and rune cross-reference does intensify, meeting Accumulative lens, and the dawn beat offers a light CR, so closure squeaks by with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.3)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—images and memories layer rather than cause turns—yet pattern is taught late and closure is still declarative.  No concrete cue anchors the “substitute body” backstory, so the causal trigger that justifies her new purpose is missing on-page.  Final image is a glow on the tooth, but no felt price or irreversible change is dramatized; therefore RR/CR is weak.  Orientation clear; no penalty, but escalation stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the polished glass becomes a “beacon” that reframes the quest from fire-less sharing to embodied radiance; cost is felt in the final “pearl of tranquility” image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each polishing stroke deepens pattern rather than forcing external turns—and the lens holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. The missing middle escalation (no visible failure or trade-off) keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sunlight walk re-weights the pendant from wound to talisman, cost legible in the phrase “heart a little lighter, spirit a little freer.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: icicle pattern → flower → shared silence → recharged pendant. However, the viral-confession stake is named once and never re-enters the scene, so the tightening is purely tonal; no option is foreclosed on-page. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cleared mist and the woman’s approving reappearance crystallize the narrator’s regained fluency, reweighting the shell as talisman. Causality, however, is soft—the ghostly cameo supplies the turning impulse instead of an earned choice that forecloses risk; the “because” is spectral, not personal. Orientation is swift and coherent; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat is present, but the price (failure, lost time, social cost) is only declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the communal song reconfigures connection and the vine’s glow makes cost legible; causal chain is soft—device succeeds on first try without setback, so tension is more accumulative/textural than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the plate’s pulsing map is a Charged Poise that reweights the crater from dead orchard to living cartograph. Causal chain—pattern-making → starlight infusion → blood seal → heartbeat translation—holds without gaps; no orientation debt. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the hum synchronizes with her pulse, forcing the final seal. Cost is legible in “channel her own life force,” satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—light, echo, crystal rhythm—and layers density until the restored ticking crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cavern’s new heartbeat is the undeniable cost, locking Elian into lifelong return visits. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“winding tunnels of the marble cavern”). No causality breaks; every beat is a therefore-link of attention and angle-study that tightens obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until dawn reweights the tapestry’s meaning, delivering a Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure is legible—she steps back, lamp out, mist retreat—but the conceptual cost (“weights of burdens”) is named, not felt; no concrete constraint lingers. The pattern is taught early (shingled hush, fractal threads) and repaid in the final hush, satisfying coherence if not visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: rain, scrape, steam layer into a cadence shift that reweights loss from raw to workable. Closure is Charged Poise—final carved object + emptied kettle crystallize options; cost is felt (“moment was fleeting”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Single deepening suffices, but absence of external test keeps it just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative lens holds: fragment-gathering intensifies texture until the single click reweights the premise; orientation is taught early through mirrored sky/water and the halted carousel; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing— the exposed frame makes irretrievability felt—though the beat could be sharper if the wheel’s earlier clicks had tightened choice rather than echoed mood.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: terminal hums alive, Maya walks away charged with purpose, the image of “beacon” reprices her trek. Causal track holds: sextant find → pattern reading → pipe reroute → life support restart. Escalation is light (one reported success) but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final cadence shift lands. Orientation within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is conceptual (spent night, glow as proof) not visceral, so holds at 7.2 rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via ticking density and petrichor echo; closure is Charged Poise—“harmonize the mechanical with the natural” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Anchor triad delivered by line 4; orientation clear. Lacked causal trigger for bear approach; coincidence allowed under lens but keeps escalation mild. Final image satisfies RR test yet no persistent constraint shapes future tactics; cost is felt but not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    A single, continuous dusk-to-dawn arc is cleanly oriented; causality is lyrical–accumulative rather than plot-heavy. The sundial’s appearance acts as a conceptual repricing: Lyra’s past self-narrative is reframed with serene, undeniable cost. The lens holds: pattern teaches itself early (twilight canal as mirror) and lands in a charged poise. Cost is felt—“the lies she had told herself”—but the beat is compressed; a hair more dramatized forfeiture would lift it to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mood thickens through weather and fog until a pattern is read. Orientation is clear by line 20; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—rope re-coiled, fog total—yet the cost is atmospheric, not character-bound; no option is foreclosed for her. Because no constraint or price shapes tactics, the closure feels decorative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: the snapped thread puff of dust reweights memory and connection, felt cost legible. Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of absence, shadow, thread, lunar glow— Cadence shift at “lunar glow” reframes silence from oppressive to luminous. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality break. However, no prior beat threatens or forecloses an option; escalation is purely atmospheric accumulation, satisfying the lens yet thin on tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the world “stirring” is an external image, not a legible before/after shift in the prince’s options or knowledge. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—mood and motif density build toward the final shimmer—but the text never crystallizes a cost the prince must now bear. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the palace’s physical rules (how a suspended fortress can “shudder and lurch”) remain fuzzy, weakening internal logic. The piece satisfies the letter of closure but not the felt reweighting required for elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory motifs (lagoon, sand, coin, rain) layer until the final “kelp-drift peace” reweights the stake. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the grafted branch crystallizes Aria’s stance and the cost is the acceptance of her own scars, felt in the final rain image. However, the tightening is modest—no option is foreclosed and no price is extracted on the page—so the reconfiguration is more mood-shift than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb-image layers density until the box-opening serves as Conceptual Repricing that reweights the city’s memory-rule. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the geese shard pattern is taught early and repaid when fountains restart. Causality is loose—memory-release mechanically revives fountains—but the lyrical contract accepts metaphoric linkage, so the closure image carries conceptual cost. No persistent price shapes Aria’s future, nudging the score down from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final “troubling serenity” re-weights the premise that illumination can survive without fire. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Orientation is taught in the first sentence (“nebula garden”) so no penalty. No meaningful tightening occurs—stakes remain the same diffuse wonder—so the arc inches rather than turns; keeps it below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: butterfly arrival thickens mood rather than pivots plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lunar glow re-weights grief into beauty—yet cost is conceptual, not lived. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causality break, but no tightening beat either. The poem fragment is recycled memory, not new knowledge that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ridge, pendulum, and rake handle layer images until the final cadence reweights “incremental absolution.” Orientation is clear by line 3, transitions are smooth, and the closure is a Charged Poise—the golden light reconfigures the stake without a new causal turn. Cost is felt (“weight slowly lifting”) but not visibly paid; the lens holds yet the tightening is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the gardener exits under starlight newly attuned to “the thrum of uncharted echoes,” reweighting the world with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is linear and coherent—sovereign case → tapestry decode → crystal hum → attunement—but escalation is gentle, not tightening; each beat adds texture rather than narrows option. The chess-clock expiry is a memorable image yet functions only as atmospheric time-passage, not a constraint that forces tactic change. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the deepening satisfies, but the absence of a palpable trade-off keeps it short of the 7.3+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is attempted via Charged Poise—the pen still hovers—yet the promised cost never materializes on the page; the future remains potential, not reweighted. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image merely repeats the opening stakes rather than tightening or deepening them. Because no constraint is actually tested or lost, the reader feels no before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is present as a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust swirls into “tangible storyform” and the radio glow lingers as Charged Poise, reweighting the premise. Causality beneath this, however, is associative: broadcast → transcribe → dust obeys; no intermediate beat tests or complicates Emilia’s agency, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is secure within 120 words; single-scene default met. The lack of a tightening reversal means escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is conceptual rather than lived, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the portrait→ash progression layers density until the final ash drift delivers a Conceptual Repricing (safety = mirage). Causality is lyric rather than plot, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last sentence. The Orientation Test is met inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final image of Kael smiling in darkness crystallizes his renunciation (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—he forfeits rebuilding for obsessive excavation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: layers of ruin, cog, and text density reweight his stance rather than plot turns. Orientation is anchored by word 45 (“Kael huddled in the dimly lit sewer”), satisfying the single-scene window. The lens holds, but the cost is felt more abstractly than viscerally, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-scene lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through sensory echo rather than causal turn. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of rustling leaves re-weights the earlier “traveled stillness” with quiet cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The pattern holds, but the cost is atmospheric, not tactical—lacks a persistent constraint that reshapes next moves.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout appears in charged light, reweighting the greenhouse from ruin to cradle—felt cost is the irreversible passage of the alignment and the quiet confession that this is only “the beginning.” Causal linkage holds: alignment + seed + dish → communal epiphany; no late rule changes. One soft spot: the synaptic-plasticity mechanic is asserted rather than tested, so the seed’s sprouting feels lightly convenient rather than earned by prior struggle. Still, the ending image crystallizes options and stakes cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is present—riddle prompts inspection, log reveals adaptation—but the decisive change (repurposing the hive) is asserted off-page with no visible cost to anyone. Closure is a gentle thematic summary, not a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that reweights the tower’s future. The piece stays within single-scene default and orients early, so no structural caps apply.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.7)
    The closure is a conceptual reweighting (house = living entity) but no visible cost is dramatized; she simply “felt” the shift. The causal chain is loose—“shard of hush” is never shown to do anything; its power is asserted rather than tested. Orientation is fine, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the text never tightens or risks a loss. The ending image is pretty but does not foreclose a path or charge future options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s decay is reframed as resilient adaptation, and the statue accepts its eternal vigil with quiet satisfaction—an earned stasis whose cost is the perpetual burden of animation. Causality is interior and accumulative; the ampoule’s arrival feels serendipitous, but the statue’s interpretive act drives the decisive change. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlit greenhouse → memory flood → canvas creation; each beat layers density rather than causal reversal. Closure lands in Charged Poise: dawn finds the canvas pulsing, city smog returning, painter smiling with “weight of her task” felt. The cost is conceptual—she must keep returning, the work never done—but the lack of an external obstacle or jeopardy keeps the tightening gentle. Orientation is clear by line 40; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is present as a soft CR—Elena’s new “mantle” of guardianship—but the cost is purely rhetorical; nothing is foreclosed or paid. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ice thaw → bread reveal → memory duty; linkage is imagistic, not causal. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the beekeeper trigger is off-stage backstory, so the final reweighting feels retrofitted rather than prepared. No persistent constraint shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure gives a Charged Poise: the lighthouse now glows and the keeper carries “latent radiance,” a legible before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality, however, is soft—finding the yoyo is accident, not choice, and the stone’s activation reads like magic without price. Orientation is secure within 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone flares, but the cost is only asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is a blackout followed by a shrug: “I knew that I would never forget” states cost but does not show a foreclosed path or stance shift under any lens. Causality is talk-and-then: the advisor whispers, the narrator obeys, mirror appears, figure glows—no narrowing of options or knowledge change. Orientation is clear early, but the ending drifts into portent without reconfiguring stakes, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a lyrical fade-out (“faintest echo of her music”) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; nothing on-page reweights stakes or meaning, so the required closure unit is absent. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely restates the opening mood without a pattern break or cost. Orientation is clear early, yet causality is slack: each beat is “and-then she tapped” rather than “because/therefore,” so pressure never tightens. The mallet and orchard are present throughout, but their final state is identical to their initial state, leaving no measurable before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Lyra steps beyond the city, watchers silent, cost felt in foreboding image. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the crack-pattern deciphering is the only causal linkage, and its payoff (map + note) arrives without prior pattern-teaching, so the tightening feels accidental rather than earned. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. Causality remains thin: the expedition’s fate is told via decoded note, not dramatized choice, so the decisive change is mostly atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: incremental discoveries reweight the myth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—sunlight on dust motes re-prices the station as liberated space. Cost, however, is purely conceptual; no constraint or forfeiture lingers for Emilia. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact but slight—discovery follows search without resistance or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the inkwell left behind reweights absence—yet the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, so the causality gate is satisfied. However, the repeated reflective loops ("interlaced absence," "whispers of the past") stall forward pressure, and the note-planting method is named only in summary, blurring the decisive change’s trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of stillness → decoding → stamping tightens once with the “bold annotation” beat; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the library as her private archive. Causality is light—decryption success feels pre-ordained—but the final image of blue ink on drowned paper carries conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no disorientation taught, so no penalty. Meets 600-word scope; single scene, single POV, one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released crane reconfigures grief into something airborne, cost felt in the ache that precedes it. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of polish-fold-release tightens through repetition rather than external turns—valid for lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the basilica is introduced as a possible external catalyst but never alters tactics; its promise remains off-stage, so the tightening is purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to “hunt” unused potential is crystallized, cost acknowledged (“heart still bearing the scars”). Causal chain is thin—flyer-to-observatory transition is pure convenience—but the lens (Causal) holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is linear but intact: chip-signal → star-map → chip found → console lights up. Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing—Lena re-weights “belonging” from missing artifact to cosmic connection—yet the cost is only asserted (“journey far from over”) not felt on-page. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no meaningful tightening or constraint narrows her options inside the scene; escalation is flat. The lens holds as straightforward Causal, but the ending image lacks a tangible forfeiture or fresh limit.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated “sieved hush” and sea imagery thicken mood until final stoic resolve. However, no decisive change or felt cost lands—she simply decides to “continue,” so closure is declaration, not reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by 50 words; spatial track clean. Lack of causal tightening keeps pressure flat; driftwood memory is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the negotiator pockets the pull while the moon sets, an image that reweights the stalemate into fragile equilibrium. Causality, however, is thin—moon phases are named but never shape an on-page beat; the breakthrough is declared, not shown. Orientation is clear by line 4. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the single intensification is the pocketing gesture, but its cost is only poetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as declared emotional state, not on-page change. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of ocean, poles, regret—but the texture never deepens; it merely circles. No new knowledge or option is foreclosed. The final “gratitude” is unanchored to any observable forfeiture, so cost is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure attempt: “Charged Poise” via the mist-veiled path and glowing ball. The image is atmospheric but lacks a concrete, felt cost—she simply “disappears” with the same determination she arrived with. Causal chain is loose: the newspaper clue leads her here, but the ball does not trigger a decision that narrows or re-prices her options; it merely accompanies her. Orientation is clear by 120 w; no lens contradiction, hence no Orientation penalty, yet the final beat does not reweight the premise, keeping the score shy of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise—the cosmic intimacy image reweights Lyra’s world—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is only vaguely “felt,” not concrete. Orientation is swift and atmospheric; who-where-when anchors inside 120 words, so no penalty. Causality is loose: the fortune cookie is thematic prompt, not a trigger that alters tactics; ritual mechanics are asserted rather than tested. The final luminescence lands as lyric reconfiguration, satisfying RR, but the absence of a persistent price caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of vanishing into “cloudbound memories” reweights the premise that lost time accrues between memories. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mist, crack, hand-tracings—held cleanly to the end. Orientation is taught early (“midnight glade above the clouds” by line 2) and waives any penalty. Cost is felt but conceptual rather than visceral; the book-unfastening is the only physical act, so the tightening is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative lens: each stitched photograph adds density until the final image reframes the ship’s emptiness. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kwan Yin’s Tear floats, the dimension cracks open, cost is the flood of ancestral grief she must now carry. Causality is lyrical, not sequential, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure aims for Conceptual Repricing but the “cost” is only atmospheric. Causality is loose—old woman appears as coincidence engine, prophecy asserted retroactively. No meaningful tightening beyond repeated “whispering hush” cadence. Orientation is clear but escalation stays static; final image reweights little because stakes were never concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.7)
    Causal linkage is present but thin: blackout → sundial message → glow → revolution. The blackout itself is unexplained and therefore tensionless; the sundial code is a one-step decipher with no prior setup or constraint; the cradle’s activation resolves rather than tightens. Closure lands as a soft CR (“a new era had begun”) but the cost is rhetorical, not on-page. The lens is Causal, yet the because/therefore chain feels editorial rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a vision-delivery that “lifts” the curse: a Conceptual Repricing with faint cosmic cost, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural). Causality is loose—rocks arranged → vision granted—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting facts. The beat is single-scene, single-POV, within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the storm’s beauty is re-seen through “newfound understanding,” but the understanding itself is asserted, not shown in a decision or forfeiture. Causality is accumulative/textural; the timer’s ticking and the envelope’s reveal create cadence, not plot. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is deliberate and pays off lyrically. Still, the final image carries only atmospheric, not actionable, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: victory reframed as journey, with the sundial angles and needle card re-weighted. Causal chain is loose—opponent arrives late, sundial decoding is off-stage, and the decisive argumentative “move” is never specified—so pressure feels situational rather than earned. Because the duel’s tactical stakes remain abstract, the cost is more asserted than felt. Still, the final image cleanly reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative lens, satisfying the minimum bar.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight and rust imagery recur, culminating in dawn-lit library rebirth; the pattern is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the city’s future, but the cost is only asserted (“the city was not yet saved”). Orientation clear by 120 words; no因果 breaks, yet escalation is gentle—no tightening beat forecloses an option. The final uplift feels predetermined, not paid for.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory selection favors metallic decay (rust, hinges, tin) and lunar silver; details are filtered through the poet’s salvage aesthetic. Library steps, moon angle, and interior debris track spatially. Micro-setting (coffee tin) doubles as talisman and secret box, but its false bottom is never used tactically—missed constraint opportunity. Atmosphere supports theme of beauty-from-ruin without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ambiguous Drive Lens (lyric-accumulative) is taught early and held; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the clock as perpetual refuge. Orientation anchors arrive late (~140 words) but serve the final image, so the Orientation Test is waived. The cost is conceptual (eternal return to frozen time), not visceral, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece is an atmospheric loop: dreams are interpreted, seed is tended, monsoon arrives—no causal pivot or tightening actually changes Aria’s options or knowledge. Closure is a sentimental dissolve (“Aria vanished into the mist”) rather than a decisive change with felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but never deepens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass-lace bundle released into the tide reweights memory with felt, conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lace ritual is the single decisive tightening, taught early enough, and the final image crystallizes stance without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the butterfly dust and greenhouse decay building thematic density. However, closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost: Maria’s realization is circular, not transformative. The Orientation Test passes early, but the ending offers conceptual repetition, not repricing—no path is foreclosed, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (frost, ledger, scorched testament). However, the closure—a quiet epiphany of peace and purpose—lacks legible cost: nothing is lost, refused, or irrevocably altered on the page. The “scorched testament” implies past trauma, but no present sacrifice or constraint shapes the ending, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear by line 3; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently through sensory layering and cadence shifts culminating in the “symphony of silence.” Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes their shared purpose with felt cost (the chill outside, the fragility of their world). However, the “rectify the discord” beat lacks concrete stakes—it’s abstractly stated, not dramatized with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker renounces surface life to become guardian of the library, foreclosing prior existence with quiet cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory and symbolic density (lens, signal, silence)—not causality, which fits the lyrical design. However, the “mysterious package” functions as deus ex machina; its origin and sender remain unexplained, introducing coincidence that complicates but doesn’t arise from established logic. Cost is felt (his lifelong solitude) but not dramatized in a decisive final action—only stated.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds resonance through repeated images (bell, arbor, lanterns) and communal gestures. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Akira’s quiet resolve crystallizes the community’s stance with felt cost (ongoing sanctions, vulnerability). However, the cost remains generalized; no specific loss or foreclosed path is legible on the page. The bell’s chime echoes, but nothing has changed except mood, limiting causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: love resides within. Orientation is clear by line 30. However, the pilgrim’s arrival functions as deus ex machina—coincidence resolves inner conflict rather than Aria’s choices. Closure lands as Charged Poise (Aria alone, changed), but cost is conceptual only (“peace,” “understanding”), not felt through sacrifice or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story fails the Orientation Test: while setting and protagonist are named early, the causal logic of time manipulation remains unanchored, creating disorientation that doesn’t pay off at closure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a decisive tightening—events accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“texture of time” revealed), yet cost is abstract, not legible in a specific image or sacrifice. The fading photograph vanishes without consequence, undermining narrative causality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is declared (“seeds of change had been sown”) but not dramatized as a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The narrative relies on summary over scene: the vault infiltration, seed distribution, and transformation of soil are told, not shown. Orientation is clear early, but causality collapses into thematic assertion without because/therefore linkage tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory impressions until the crystalline “shattering” moment lands as Conceptual Repricing: trust’s fracture becomes a tool for healing. Cost is legible—Lyra’s peace comes only after channeling loss into craft—but the escalation relies on atmospheric thickening rather than narrowing options. The closure image (dawn, swirling colors/sounds) reweights the premise with emotional resonance, though no path is foreclosed, limiting Earned Stasis impact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere over causality, but closure lacks decisive change or felt cost. The “message” in flowers functions as decorative prompt fulfillment, not a causal pivot. Lumina’s departure mirrors their entrance—no reconfiguration of options or stance crystallization occurs. The final image is pretty but inert; nothing is lost, gained, or irrevocably altered, failing the Closure requirement for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the story lacks a decisive intensification: it accumulates mood without narrowing options or altering knowledge. Closure attempts Charged Poise but fails the cost test—the final image glows with hope yet shows no felt or conceptual price paid. The bookmark and orb recur but don’t constrain choice; the ending reasserts intent without foreclosing a path. No on-page sentence makes cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story adopts a Causal lens but falters: the seashell and cast appear without setup, and decryption lacks procedural stakes—no failed attempts, time pressure, or tactical adaptation. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“truth is in the shadows”), but cost is abstract (“fragile existence”) rather than felt or visible. The Orientation Test passes (library, night, solo), yet the drive lacks tightening—discovery to resolution is linear, not pressured. No path is foreclosed; the protagonist simply walks out “ready.”

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and rhythmic layering until the final image reconfigures meaning—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the “cost” remains conceptual and oblique: the storm ends, darkness recedes, but no tangible or emotional price is legible on the page. The flaking booklet glows, but its transformation lacks causal grounding in prior beats. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands coherently, though without decisive stakes paid.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clear, but the story lacks causal escalation: nothing *happens* that changes options or knowledge. The “plot” is a loop of pondering → walking → realizing, with no meaningful tightening. Closure is declared (she’s “free”) but unearned—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet density doesn’t intensify; it repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails to deliver a decisive intensification: it accumulates lyrical description without narrowing options or deepening stakes through causally linked pressure. The closure is a static image (“the dresser would vanish into the shadows”) lacking Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized under duress. The repeated assertion that “luck became measurable” introduces a rule-change never dramatized or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: time moves sideways. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Kaelin returns unharmed, data intact, with only vague “icy warmth” as consequence. The nexus appears, transports her, and vanishes without irreversible stakes or foreclosed paths. Orientation is clear early, but the transition to the alien landscape feels like passive spectacle, not earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3 (“Rachel huddled in the orchestra pit... flooded opera house”). Closure takes the form of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rachel departs changed, carrying the program as proof of a liminal communion, with emotional cost implied in her solitude and the permanence of the experience. However, the “code” resolution remains abstract—no concrete stakes are forfeited or paths foreclosed beyond mood, weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered logbook entries, shared observations, and recurring motifs until the final conceptual repricing crystallizes. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Aria; where: mountain weather station; when: post-fever). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: truth is provisional, ephemeral—a reweighting of the entire epistemic premise—with auroral sorrow as felt cost. The pattern is taught early and paid off cohesively, though the escalation lacks a single tightening that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a decisive intensification: radio static and a found logbook deepen mood without narrowing options or raising stakes. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the “weight of swallowed truth” revealed—but no on-page cost is legible; satisfaction replaces sacrifice. The beaded valve wheel and logbook appear without causal linkage, functioning as atmospheric props rather than pressure points. Orientation is clear, but the story accumulates texture without reweighting it into consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (silence, decay, origami). Orientation is clear by line 30: who (chronicle keeper), where (catacombs/library), when (timeless drift). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the keeper endures, fused with the catacombs—but the cost (“crumbling peace”) is conceptual, not dramatized. No decisive turn narrows options; escalation is tonal, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward the eclipse climax. Orientation is clear early (Sage Ridge, dusk, Aria alone), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli’s awe crystallizes connection to “ordinary magic.” However, cost is abstract—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The eclipse is coincidental backdrop, not causal engine; events could unfold identically under moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The ending offers mood (“bronze quiet”) and completion-feeling but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after state clear. The diaries’ “last entry faded into illegibility” halts progression without consequence. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—only ambiance accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Structure collapses under its own ornamentation: the story mistakes repetition for escalation and declaration for causality. No decisive tightening occurs—“orchestrating the meeting” is asserted, not dramatized—and the ending offers only thematic echo, not closure with cost. The drive lens is ambiguous (Hybrid attempted but neither Causal nor Accumulative coheres), and the final image fails the Cost Proof Test: nothing is lost, refused, or reconfigured with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: the land is renewed through sound and silence. However, the “possession” threat is introduced too late and never concretely tested, weakening causal pressure. The climax lacks a decisive turn—tension accumulates but doesn’t narrow options or force a costly choice. Cost is asserted (“averted possession”) but not shown or felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure: the writer becomes “the conductor of unheard symphonies” amid mirrored stillness. However, cost is abstract—no path is foreclosed, no stamina lost, no memory sacrificed. The Orientation Test passes early (glass spire, frozen lake, dawn), but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening; the “pace quickens” without consequence. Time “bending to accommodate” feels like convenience, not constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks causality: the labyrinth reconfigures arbitrarily, and procedural generation functions as magic, not method. Closure attempts Charged Poise (“figure of darkening brightness”), but cost is absent—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when clear by line 3), yet the causal vacuum undercuts thematic weight. Fractured timelines are named but never concretely affect decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and rhythmic cadence intensify until the final image of Aria at peace reweights silence as music. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where stillness becomes active guardianship, with emotional numbness receding as conceptual cost. However, no on-page decision narrows options; pressure accumulates atmospherically but lacks a tightening beat that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration: the ending offers stance crystallization without legible cost or foreclosed path. Key beats rely on coincidence (pigeon arrival, prior being followed) that complicates but doesn’t escalate pressure meaningfully. The cryptic message is solved off-stage via summary (“she finally pieced together”), robbing the climax of dramatized discovery. Closure lacks felt consequence—no sacrifice, exposure, or altered reality is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure meaningfully: the “transformation” of plants is passive spectacle, not a turn that reweights stakes or narrows options. Closure attempts Earned Stasis (accepting memory’s fragility), but the cost isn’t legible—Elara’s sorrow lifts without sacrifice or altered future behavior. The ultraviolet lights function as deus ex machina, not a constraint shaped by prior causality. No decisive tightening occurs; reflection dominates without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (rope, stone patterns, texture of time) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the world as a canvas of possibility. However, the closure lacks legible cost—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The dawn ending offers epiphany without consequence, violating the Closure requirement of felt or conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, but pressure never tightens into a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (chronic hush, bowl, greenhouse) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush is “tempered” by connection. Orientation is clear by line 30, and closure lands with conceptual cost—the loss of the rainforest remains, but meaning shifts. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the bonfire scene arrives without prior pressure or obstacle, relying on coincidence rather than causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density rather than causal progression. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the grotto dims as she departs, the stones “whispering approval,” suggesting her work has resonated—but the cost is implied, not legible on the page. No decisive change or foreclosed path is shown; the ending evokes mood without stakes crystallization. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening that alters options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a Situational lens—coincidence (the locket, the envelope) complicates but also resolves, violating the rule that chance may not solve. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“cycles of compassion”), but cost is abstract, not felt on the page; no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The mistaken envelope functions as deus ex machina, not earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true closure with legible cost. The ending offers thematic resonance but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after state legible with felt consequence. The “shared search” yields a symbol that triggers inspiration, not transformation; the community’s acceptance arrives without resistance, negotiation, or sacrifice. Cost is asserted (“ache transformed into peace”) but never dramatized or priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns of light, time, and echo deepen until the climax reweights perception. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who: Lyra; where: rooftop canal; when: dawn). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the city’s hidden cadence is revealed, altering how reality is perceived—but the “cost” remains abstract (a faint tremor, not a personal sacrifice). The giant’s stirring implies consequence, yet Lyra suffers no loss, limiting emotional or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: emotion’s mathematics are fluid, not fixed. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the conjurer departs with quiet certainty, the orchard transformed from site of loss to possibility. However, the ritual lacks concrete stakes or tangible consequence; the “spark of understanding” feels intellectual rather than earned through pressure. Cost is implied (“ambiguous loss”) but never dramatized as a foreclosed path or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details and hidden acts build toward a Charged Poise closure—the dweller remains unseen but leaves resonant traces. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who, where, when). However, the “decisive change” is diffuse; the transformation of the library feels atmospheric rather than consequential. Cost is implied (invisibility) but not dramatized as a foreclosed path with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with felt cost. Emilia’s “metamorphosis” is asserted repeatedly but never shown through a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that forecloses a path or incurs price. The ending offers stasis, not transformation—she smiles, tends plants, and feels peace, contradicting the claimed stakes of relinquishing control. No on-page sentence demonstrates what she has lost or irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is attempted via Conceptual Repricing (“Convergence” as title and realization), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no foreclosed path or tangible loss is shown. The plot relies on convenient discovery (brooch, markings, stranger) without causal linkage; “rain trails” and “markings” function as exposition, not pressure-driven tactics. The Orientation Test passes early, but the drive lens drifts between Accumulative and Causal without coherence, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive tightening or deepening that narrows options; instead, it layers lyrical description without escalating pressure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“magic is part of existence”), but cost is conceptualized, not felt—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The pilgrim’s arrival is unforeshadowed yet causes no disruption to Aria’s stability, undercutting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost—closure relies on declarative sentiment (“beacon of hope,” “testament to remembrance”) rather than a charged final image that reweights stakes. Key beats like purchasing the valve and installing displays are summarized, not dramatized, flattening escalation. Orientation is clear early, but the exile’s end functions as backdrop, not a causal constraint shaping tactics. No decisive narrowing of options or visible forfeiture occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with cost. The vault’s corridors and mist accumulate atmosphere but not pressure; Emilia encounters no obstacle that narrows options or demands sacrifice. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing (“world now full of possibility”), yet cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture, loss, or irreversible choice makes the before/after legible. The phantom punch hums and vibrates but never constrains action or exacts price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery (whales, tile, sea) rather than causal turns. Closure manifests as a Conceptual Repricing: the world is re-seen through entangled memory, with cost implied in Emilia’s irreversible shift in perception. However, the lack of a decisive narrowing of options or tangible trade-off weakens pressure escalation; the “work” of transcription never faces concrete resistance or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and conceptual layering intensify toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—“goodbye” redefined as transformation. Anchors (Kael, escondite, solar storm) are established early; causality is maintained through magnetic field manipulation leading to the duplicate’s emergence. Cost is legible in the closing image: Kael departs, leaving only an echo—existence continues, but solitude is traded for multiplicity. However, the “spatial mutiny” concept lacks concrete stakes or failure risk, softening the cost’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story lands a valid Charged Poise closure: options and stakes crystallize as Lena commits to the breach, with cost felt in the “deathly vitality” of the prep room. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the Situational lens holds—pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving conflict. However, the escalation hinges almost entirely on dialogue summary (“We’re making progress”) rather than dramatized turning points, weakening causal density. The final image reconfigures meaning but lacks a concrete, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lamp fades, the notepad closes, and the forest holds its breath—a crystallized moment where the stationer’s work is complete. However, there is no visible or felt cost; nothing is lost, foreclosed, or risked. The structure is coherent and atmospheric, but the lack of escalation beyond sensory accumulation prevents true pressure. The Orientation Test passes cleanly, but the ending reweights nothing with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive intensification: “layering fragments” never tightens into a meaningful turn with cost. Closure is a vague “sense of clarity” without Decisive Change, Earned Stasis, or Conceptual Repricing—no before/after legibility or felt consequence. The tide’s rhythm is decorative, not a causal or textural constraint shaping narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a “decisive change” where she “unlocks the secrets of the universe”—lacks legible cost or reconfiguration. The “ephemeral compass clicking into place” is asserted, not dramatized, and no path is foreclosed or endured. Orientation is clear early, but the escalation relies on intensifying description rather than tightening pressure or narrowing options, resulting in a crescendo without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density via graffiti, but fails to deliver on-page closure with legible cost. The ending offers Charged Poise in concept, yet no concrete sacrifice, renunciation, or irreversible act crystallizes the stakes. Key beats are summarized (“residents stood ready”) rather than dramatized, leaving the decisive shift off-stage. Orientation is clear early, but causality remains declarative, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure meaningfully—Dr. Patel’s message states urgency without introducing new constraints or narrowing options. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing (beauty preserved via image), but cost remains abstract (“eyes stung”) rather than legible in action or sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, yet the plot lacks a decisive tightening beat that reweights stakes beyond stated deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, light, drone, and ship coalesce into a resonant closure (Charged Poise). Emilia’s calibration culminates in the drone’s steady hover—a reconfiguration charged by environmental harmony. Yet the ship’s departure functions as coincidental backdrop, not causal pressure; its “auspicious” timing risks deus ex machina. Cost is implied (time, focus) but never made legible as sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Emilia finds a pattern, deciphers it instantly, and departs—no obstacles, failed attempts, or narrowing options. The “singular convergence” is never tested or concretely defined, rendering stakes inert. Closure fails: stepping onto the lake is atmospheric but not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the accumulation never reweights meaning—it merely repeats mood.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rhythm, vibration, and silence build density until the town stirs—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with conceptual cost: revival is fragile, incremental, and dependent on continued effort (“process of revival was ongoing”). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is internal to the pattern, not event-driven, which fits the lens. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates but never narrows options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory density and recurring motifs building toward closure. However, the “gathered hush” and temple whispers function as ambient mood rather than active pressure that tightens options. The climax—harnessing energy—is summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal payoff. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (preservation at personal cost), but the cost (“heavy heart,” “melancholy”) is stated, not shown through irreversible loss or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    No valid closure lands: the ending offers atmospheric continuation (“story unfolding around him”) without Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The “before they find the bodies” clause introduces stakes too late and off-stage, failing to crystallize options or impose cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the piece accumulates description without pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the central stake. Orientation is sound, but pressure never tightens into consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Structure follows a static cause-effect loop: ghost appears → alchemist takes bead → plants awaken → ghost fades. No escalation tightens options or raises stakes; the “debt repayment” resolves via passive observation, not earned causality. Closure attempts Earned Stasis but fails the cost test—the ghost’s departure feels weightless, not foreclosed. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet density increases without pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The tapestry’s completion is asserted, not dramatized, and the labyrinth’s transformation feels decorative, not consequential. Orientation is clear early (wharf weaver in canyon labyrinth), but the ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt or conceptual price—only repeated affirmations of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and discovery without causal escalation. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Maya stands amid bones and trees, reconfigured by her labor. However, cost remains conceptual—no tangible forfeiture or irreversible choice tightens the ending. The sundial’s symbolic weight isn’t earned through dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere over causality, but closure lacks decisive cost: the letter’s dispatch feels weightless, not foreclosing any path. Orientation is clear early (golden arcade at dawn, Cipher alone), satisfying spatial/temporal anchoring. However, the ending offers Charged Poise without legible sacrifice—no visible price for choosing slowness in a fast world. Pattern of chalk codes and clipboard recurs but doesn’t tighten options or alter knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: threads, flame, and silence build toward a Charged Poise closure where the chart vibrates with “otherworldly energy” and the embroiderer knows they’ve succeeded “just in time.” However, the coup remains off-stage and abstract; no concrete reversal or knowledge shift tightens options. Cost is implied (“urgency,” “before it was too late”) but never made legible in action or sacrifice—only in mood.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating density of spirits’ voices, condensation messages, and emotional weight culminating in a Charged Poise closure: Aria stands at the threshold of uncertainty, changed. Cost is legible—the lifting sorrow, the healed skin—but the “moment before deciding” is described rather than enacted, weakening causal pressure. Orientation is strong early (mangrove labyrinth, medium, moonlight), and the pattern of revelation via shard and window is taught and paid off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic resonance, but lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with cost. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the coral becomes a symbol of fragile beauty—but the cost remains vague and unanchored in action. The child’s cast is deciphered off-page via summary, not dramatized struggle, weakening causal integrity. Orientation is clear early (atoll atrium, twilight, Kael), so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and image density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands: Lena’s mural reanimates the orchard “if only for a moment,” and she departs with renewed purpose—cost implied in abandoned film and forsaken repetition. However, the fresco fragment’s “secret” is never dramatized as deciphered; its glow feels decorative, not causally earned. No orientation issues; anchors are firm by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and patterned resonance until the mural’s transformation crystallizes Lena’s internal shift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world is reweighted as “a kaleidoscope of possibilities,” with the cost being the loss of certainty—a felt, conceptual price made legible in the final image of the living forest. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is maintained through consistent cause-effect within the established magical rules. No coincidences resolve pressure; Lena’s agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the story accumulates description, not pressure. There is no meaningful tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights stakes—only repetitive assertions of Lyra’s success. Closure fails: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers stasis without sacrifice, endurance without obstacle, and resonance without reconfiguration—just circular affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and emotional resonance through recurring images. Orientation is solid by line 30: insomniac poet in a mollusk shell with bioluminescent fungi. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the poet achieves peace and sleeps—but the cost (“weight of her centuries-long vigil”) is stated rather than shown through a decisive act or tangible sacrifice. The postcard functions as motif, not causal engine, weakening escalation despite lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (orchids, wind chime, song) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library glows, emotions briefly return, and the caretaker accepts her endless task. Cost is legible in the cracked bamboo tube and the melancholic smile—symbols of irreversible loss and ongoing labor. Orientation is strong from the first sentence (“opal library above the clouds”), and closure lands with Charged Poise: options are crystallized (she must continue), stakes reconfigured (preservation is fragile but possible), and cost felt (loneliness, irreparable damage). However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates but doesn’t narrow choices.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns of language, ink, and light build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara steps into diverging paths with renewed clarity. Orientation is solid by line 30—POV, setting, and task are anchored. Closure lands with conceptual cost (the empty ink well whispering promises), though the “symphonies of truth” feel more metaphorical than causally earned. One meaningful deepening occurs—the transcription’s completion—but escalation remains atmospheric rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true closure unit: there’s no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers epiphany without consequence—Kaelin “knows” the amphitheater’s purpose but takes no irreversible action. The Orientation Test passes early, but the lack of on-page cost (e.g., sacrificing safety for authenticity or vice versa) renders the stakes abstract and weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dust, paper trails, pigeons) until the final image crystallizes Emilia’s Charged Poise: she accepts the beauty and pain of the past. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the closure reweights the dominant stake—living with fabricated history—through the meteorite and dust motes. Yet the cost remains conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift proves what she’s lost or foreclosed. The escalation lacks a single tightening that narrows options—it deepens mood but not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: prismatic imagery, thresholds, and codes layer toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. However, the ending’s emotional payoff—father’s reappearance—feels unearned by prior causality; his presence emerges without setup or spatial logic, violating the terrace’s established rules. Cost is implied (“necessary distances”) but never dramatized as loss, sacrifice, or foreclosed path. Orientation is functional early, but the father’s sudden appearance triggers a mild causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    No causal or accumulative escalation occurs: the astrologer enters, senses, and leaves without a meaningful tightening, reversal, or deepening that alters options. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—only atmospheric affirmation. The Drive Lens is ambiguous (Accumulative/Textural attempted but fails to reweight stakes), and closure lacks on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned imagery (seeds, crystals, light) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing—paths disappear because reality is fluxive. Closure lands with CR: the geode’s truth reweights memory as transient yet connective. However, the migrating bird’s seeds function as deus ex machina; their appearance isn’t foreshadowed or earned, violating causality within an otherwise coherent accumulative arc. Cost is conceptual (“memory fades”) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost: Elian performs, is applauded, and repeats—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, there’s no pattern break, density shift, or cadence change that reweights stakes. The ending mirrors the beginning without escalation or consequence, failing the Closure requirement. “Orchestrated serendipity” is asserted but never tested by failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the moonstone anchors her hand, she dances, and the verse appears—events follow but don’t arise from motivated action or escalating pressure. Closure attempts Charged Poise (verse on skin = success), but no felt or conceptual cost is legible; exile lifts effortlessly, contradicting earlier stakes. The “nostalgia ban” is mentioned but never pressures choice. Orientation is clear, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails to tighten or reweight stakes with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers mood, not consequence: “heart full of clear complexity” is thematic assertion, not earned reconfiguration. The ripples serve as metaphor, not mechanism—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Orientation is clear early, but escalation never tightens stakes beyond lyrical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the box appears without setup, its power is untested, and Kael’s epiphany arrives via reflection, not consequence. Orientation is clear (moonlit ridge, scarred firefighter), but the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and even under that standard, escalation fails—the “deepening” is repetitive rumination, not density increase or cadence shift that reweights stakes. Closure is Conceptual Repricing, but cost is implied, not legible on the page; no sentence shows what is lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns build, light intensifies, and the gauge pulses, culminating in a vision that reweights meaning. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Aria returns unchanged except for “peace and clarity,” with no foreclosed path or tangible price. The vision is vivid but consequence-free, failing the Closure requirement’s demand for felt or conceptual cost. No option is narrowed; the trial balloons fly as before.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks causal tightening: the film strip and diaries appear conveniently without resistance or consequence. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), satisfying that test. However, closure is a Conceptual Repricing without on-page cost—no path is foreclosed, no price paid; the “burden” remains rhetorical. The ending reiterates theme but offers no decisive change or charged poise with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward a Charged Poise closure where mirrors ripple and visions appear. However, the “breakthrough” feels unearned—no prior failure, resistance, or deepening of stakes justifies the mirrors’ sudden compliance. The bells mark time but don’t tighten pressure; causality is replaced by ambient accumulation. Cost is implied (“possibilities beyond the veil”) but never legible as loss, forfeiture, or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story lacks causality: nothing *happens*—no opposition surfaces, no proposal is tested, no delegate resists or concedes. The “negotiations” are summarized, not dramatized, violating the Orientation Test by failing to anchor conflict mechanics by ~120 words. Closure is asserted (“peace was finally beginning to bear fruit”) without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration showing cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but density increases only through repetitive abstraction, not patterned intensification with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the echo of extinct birds reweights the premise with ecological and moral cost. However, the release of waters lacks causal scaffolding—it happens by declaration, not because of prior choices or constraints. The drive lens leans Accumulative/Textural, but escalation relies on atmospheric buildup, not protagonist-driven tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: snow, threads, echoes, and prism build a resonant pattern that culminates in Charged Poise—a final image where options are reconfigured (she walks away changed). However, the “untangling” lacks causal mechanics; it’s described as internal unraveling without tangible beats that narrow choices or raise stakes. Cost is implied (“echoes of her past fading”) but never made legible as a concrete forfeiture or irreversible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Amaranth enters, feels calm, writes, and leaves—no meaningful tightening, reversal, or deepening occurs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern of “serene atmosphere → epiphany” repeats without intensification or cadence shift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (storytelling ethics reweighted), yet no on-page cost is legible—the dome changes nothing tangible in her life or art. The Orientation Test passes early, but pressure never coheres into stakes that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recurring motifs build toward a Charged Poise closure—the glowing moth wing and fragile structures crystallize Aria’s purpose without decisive change. However, the “migration of the last monarch butterfly” introduces a global stakes claim that isn’t dramatized or tied to on-page pressure. Cost is implied (transience, fragility) but never embodied in a foreclosed path or tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory and symbolic density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the rope hums with transcribed memory. Orientation is solid by line 30. However, the climax lacks a decisive narrowing of options—success arrives without visible failure risk or tactical adaptation, softening escalation. Cost is implied (emotional labor) but not concretely legible in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (storm, seal, paths) toward a Conceptual Repricing: Hindsight accepts being chosen by a path. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the surrender of agency—but the “decaying directive” remains under-dramatized, weakening causal pressure. Orientation is solid early, though the dreamscape lacks spatial or temporal anchors, slightly muddying the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure fails: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending asserts transcendence without foreclosing a path or crystallizing stakes. Events unfold as atmospheric accumulation, not causal or pressured progression—“the covenant was taking shape” replaces on-page action with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive intensification—pressure remains static, and the “reality shift” arrives as unearned magic rather than patterned escalation. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the music box, but cost is vague (“brokenness” isn’t dramatized as loss). The Orientation Test passes early, yet causality falters when melody resolves conflict without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror maker vanishes into the fog, having erased the boundary between self and dream—a Charged Poise where reality and fantasy merge, paid for by her physical absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: sensory density (fog, frost, brass, molten glass) intensifies toward the final image. Cost is legible in her disappearance and the abandoned sextant. The pattern is taught early and pays off without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic resonance, but closure lacks a decisive cost: the orchard thrives, the daughter returns, and vows “flourish” without tangible sacrifice. The breach of contract is mentioned but never dramatized as active pressure; time is vague, and the pivotal seed-planting feels like a quiet gesture, not a narrowing of options. No path is foreclosed—everything resolves harmoniously, undercutting the stated stakes of withering vows.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR): knowledge as nonlinear web. However, the CR lacks on-page cost—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The robed figures and bathroom setting introduce mystery but function as ornamental scaffolding rather than causal pressure. Closure is legible but emotionally and narratively weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a causal drive lens but suffers from summary-driven progression (“embarked on a series of rescue missions,” “navigating treacherous shelves”) that replaces dramatized beats with exposition. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing—Elara revalues knowledge as something to apply—but the cost is abstract, not felt on the page. Key turns (finding the diary, renegotiating) lack concrete stakes or irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with fog, decay, and fragmented narratives building toward a Conceptual Repricing: the Garden as state of mind. However, closure lacks legible cost—peace arrives without sacrifice or foreclosed path. The emerald card and book serve as props, not pressure points that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density increases via recurring motifs (rope, seal, ticking) until the clock’s rhythm shifts, signaling closure through Conceptual Repricing—the “fables of absence” gain legible meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30, and disorientation is functional (the “door shouldn’t exist” moment). However, cost remains abstract: no tangible loss, time forfeited, or social consequence anchors the epiphany. The ending offers Charged Poise but without visible price, weakening the RR’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: resonance patterns build toward the bloom of hush, culminating in Earned Stasis—a quiet equilibrium with felt cost (the prior cacophony now harmonized). Orientation is clear by line 30. However, the “subtle shift” in crack patterns isn’t dramatized as a turning point that alters tactics; it’s reported, not enacted. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration, but the causal link between observation and outcome leans on assertion over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: the pavilion “sings a new tune” of hope. However, closure lacks legible cost—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The spark of light and golden bloom feel decorative, not consequential. Orientation is clear early, but the climax resolves via mystical convenience rather than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure: the archivist accepts her role as memory-keeper. Cost is conceptual (carrying collective memory) and legible in the final image. However, escalation is minimal—storm clears, moon appears, she touches crystal—and no meaningful tightening of options occurs. The structure is coherent but static, lacking a decisive turn that alters trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: mood, image, and sensation build toward a Charged Poise closure—the night becomes a “canvas,” and Lyra’s creative spirit rekindles. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the mosaic note resolves her block too cleanly without prior failed attempts or cost. The “hush of a starless sky” initially feels oppressive but lifts without tangible trade-off. Closure lands with conceptual resonance but minimal felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and reflection toward a Charged Poise closure: dawn arrives, figures resume talking, chronicler rises. However, no on-page cost is legible—the pause resolves without consequence, and the chronicler’s insight yields no change in stance or sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks pressure; the “transition period” concept never tightens options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: silences accumulate, gravity inverts, and the gilded hush deepens perception. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Eli’s fear isn’t gone, but its dominance recedes, with cost implied in prior dread and physical tension. Orientation is clear by line 3; the trellis, inversion hour, and stakes anchor early. The final image of the doll in Eli’s palm crystallizes change without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation or a decisive turn; it accumulates sensory detail but never tightens stakes or forecloses options. Closure is attempted as Earned Stasis (“teaching silence”), but no on-page cost or reconfiguration occurs—only declarative resolution. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image reweights nothing; silence was always present. The train whistle’s echo sets a timeframe but exerts no pressure on action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere over causality, but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration: the “unclaimed throne” becomes “claimed” without legible cost or altered options. The cryptic mural message (“Where shadows fall, light rises”) triggers a coincidental path reveal, not a protagonist-driven turn. Sunrise deadline creates mild pressure but doesn’t force meaningful sacrifice. Closure is declarative (“a new era was about to begin”) rather than dramatized with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the keeper steps forward into connection, the threshold revitalized, with implied cost in lost solitude. However, causality is accumulative/textural, not causal—the plot advances via mood and image, not because/therefore linkages. The fading threshold signals stakes early, but escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; change arrives through ambient stirring, not protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely dramatized in action or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: glitchy texts trigger lab volunteering, but their role in the diamond creation is hand-waved, not dramatized. The climax—pressure yielding diamonds—is presented as magical coincidence, not consequence of Lyra’s actions under the inferred Causal lens. Closure (diamond rain) feels decorative, not decisive; no path is foreclosed, no cost legible beyond vague “wonder.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks causal pressure: the gramophone crank triggers visions without prior setup or resistance, making escalation feel decorative rather than consequential. Orientation is clear early (sepia reading room, evening), but the closure—a "newfound understanding"—lacks visible or conceptual cost; declaring the dynasty will end isn’t dramatized as loss. The muses’ whispers resolve the quest conveniently, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” rule. No path is foreclosed with felt price—only asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—while resonant—lacks legible cost: the knight gains connection and purpose with no forfeiture or constraint visible on the page. The inciting object (program) triggers change, yet causality is associative, not pressured; reality shifts because the text says so, not due to escalating stakes. Orientation is clear early, but the “decisive” act (unsnap) resolves without complication or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the accumulation lacks a decisive intensification that reweights stakes with cost. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (forgotten stories gain value), yet no on-page sentence makes the cost legible—Emilia’s “mending heart” feels asserted, not earned. Orientation is clear early, but the narrative drifts into thematic exposition without tightening pressure. Closure lands softly but without the required felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density toward a Charged Poise closure: Aria holds the line at dawn, key in hand. However, no on-page cost is legible—her hiding ends without consequence, the gathering disperses unimpeded, and the “tyranny of indifference” exerts no active pressure. The map, key, and lagoon recur but don’t constrain outcomes, weakening causal integrity under even a textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through sensory layering, but lacks a decisive tightening or deepening that narrows options or alters knowledge. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—the mist clears, peace returns—but the cost is atmospheric, not personal or causal; no path is visibly foreclosed for the protagonist. The prophecy is “laid to rest” by beauty alone, with no dramatized test of efficacy or consequence. Orientation is strong early, but escalation relies on mood, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (leaves, moonstone glow, monuments) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s prophecy is decoded, reweighting the setting’s meaning. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the seed sorter walks away guided by legacy—but cost is oblique (no tangible loss, only vague “wonder”). The “hush” timeframe tightens stakes conceptually, though no live clock pressures action. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory motifs (waterfall, leaves, compass light) build density toward a Conceptual Repricing—“coincidence becomes pattern.” Orientation is clear by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian steps forward, options reconfigured, cost felt in the relinquishing of control. Yet the tightening lacks a decisive narrowing of options—pressure accumulates but doesn’t constrict.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood and reflection toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights brokenness as beauty. However, closure lacks a decisive on-page cost—“luminous regret” is asserted, not shown through forfeiture or irreversible choice. The zodiac coin glows, but no path is foreclosed; stakes remain abstract. Orientation is solid early, but escalation relies on repetitive introspection rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: the spirit departs, leaving behind the tooth and silence. Cost is faintly legible—the lingering “luminous ache”—but not tied to a decisive act with tangible consequence. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, sustained through sensory layering and cadence shift at the end. However, the inciting incident (spotting the light) lacks causal friction; resolution feels atmospheric rather than earned through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a Situational lens: coherent pressure (trauma, forest as reckoning) forces Elara’s stance crystallization. However, the climax—sudden comprehension of “mathematics of mercy”—lacks on-page causality; the ultraviolet forest’s transformation feels atmospheric, not consequential. Cost is implied (“penance lifting”) but never made legible through action or sacrifice. The rescue, interrogation, and epiphany remain narratively distant, summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: Lena reweights reality through intuition’s anchors. However, closure lacks legible cost—her “unfastening” has no consequence, forfeiture, or foreclosed path. The eternal instant is evocative but static; nothing is lost or irrevocably altered on the page. The painting discovery functions as revelation, not pressure-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and ghostly presence until the logbook discovery triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ezra’s purpose is affirmed, and the circus’s failure is reframed as beauty. However, the “hidden compartment” reveal leans on coincidence rather than earned deduction—the dust trail appears without prior methodological rigor. Cost is implied (“weightless burden”) but never made tactile or consequential in action; the closure image resonates emotionally but lacks legible stakes paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (frost, whisper, prints) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “Eternity is a moment’s depth.” Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the library holds its breath amid transformed clouds. However, the rupture lacks tangible consequence; the “destabilization” remains atmospheric, not dramatized with on-page cost. Orientation is strong, but escalation feels decorative rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (shard, mirrors, sorrow) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis as chronicler. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she accepts partial truth, trading revolution for narrative stewardship. However, the storm’s rumble and time’s visibility introduce stakes never tested causally; escalation relies on atmospheric thickening, not narrowing options. The final image reweights her purpose credibly, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward a crystalline note that reconfigures silence into song. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the chamber’s approving murmur and dimmed chip signal earned stasis with conceptual cost (light reclaimed, shadows held at bay). Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—pressure intensifies atmospherically but not causally, slightly weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: the unity with lagoon, earth, and compass reweights the premise of knowledge itself. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the surrender of rational explanation. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; pressure accumulates but doesn’t narrow options or force a trade-off, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern slide reweights Aria’s understanding of connection. However, cost is abstract (“deeper current of meaning”) rather than felt or visible on the page—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The GPS failure functions as convenient coincidence, not causal pressure, and the storm serves atmosphere, not escalation. Orientation is clear early, but the lack of tangible stakes weakens structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (postcards, cathedral glass, moonlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: Luna reinterprets night-blooming as part of an interconnected web. Closure lands via Charged Poise—her art now embodies “umbral tenderness,” foreclosing her former bold style with felt cost. However, the causal chain is soft; insights arrive through passive observation, not decisive action, slightly weakening escalation under even a textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the diary leads to the library, Ada appears, they talk, understanding dawns—but nothing tightens, forecloses, or deepens with cost. The ending offers mood, not closure: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible before/after. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet even by that standard, the final image (zeppelin humming) reiterates rather than reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and vision rather than causal beats, but fails to deliver a true closure unit: the ending shows transformation but offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The town “begins to flourish” off-page, robbing the climax of on-page consequence. No path is foreclosed, no price paid—only declaration replaces dramatization. The amber bottle remains inert, symbolizing potential but never constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Charged Poise: the garden holds its breath, prophecy set in motion, with conceptual cost (irreversible change marked by the silent foghorn). However, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening—emotional patterns “shift” but no live option is foreclosed or trade-off enacted. The prophecy feels declared, not earned through causally linked beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails: the ending offers thematic assertion (“not the destination… but the journey”) without Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The vortex hums, she walks away—no option is renounced, no stance crystallized with sacrifice. Orientation is clear (icebound atrium, seed saver, post-thaw), but the drive lens is ambiguous: Accumulative/Textural intent collapses into inert summary. The “egg hatching” is mentioned post-climax as retrospective justification, not causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sound motifs until the bell’s resonance reweights Ember’s role. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she abandons sirens for the bell, with the cost being the relinquishment of her official duty—felt in the quiet reverence that replaces alarm. The “zero hour” moment lacks causal urgency but functions as a lyrical pivot. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repeated motifs (stars, stillness, lantern). However, closure lacks a decisive cost: the janitor departs with “renewed purpose” but no visible forfeiture or reconfiguration that alters their options. The yellow lantern’s prominence at dawn is resonant but unearned—no prior beat shows it constraining choice or demanding sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, but escalation never tightens stakes beyond lyrical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: recluse; where: beekeeping oasis; when: post-collapse), satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via sensory and ghostly density, not causality. Closure is Earned Stasis—the recluse accepts the burden of memory—but cost is implied rather than dramatized (no visible sacrifice). Ghosts disperse without consequence, weakening felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive closure unit with legible cost. The ending offers thematic resonance (“beacon of hope”) but no Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after state tangible. Key beats—garage sale messages, capsule repair—are summarized, not dramatized, and the “hidden pattern” resolution lacks causal payoff. Orientation is stable, but escalation is static repetition, not deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the piece adheres to it: mist, feather, kite, and lapping water layer into a resonant tapestry. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the poem is “not just a reflection... but a part of it”—with subtle cost in transience (the lost kite). However, the “kite string snaps” incident functions as decorative punctuation, not a pressure point that alters knowledge or options. The burnished hush persists unchanged; stakes never tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repeated motifs (copper wire, diary, stone pillars), but lacks causal escalation or meaningful tightening. The six-month deadline is stated but never pressures specific decisions—time doesn’t alter tactics or foreclose options. Closure is Earned Stasis (the caretaker’s quiet endurance), but cost is asserted (“health declined”) rather than dramatized with visible consequence. No on-page beat shows a path being closed due to time or method.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear early (rainwashed tower, spring, lone skeptic), and closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the threshold moment reconfigures “homecoming” with conceptual cost. However, the drive lens is ambiguously Hybrid—leaning Accumulative/Textural—but lacks a decisive intensification; the “dusty footprints” path never constrains tactics or creates narrowing options. The entity’s appearance feels coincidental rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: the land’s healing reframes war’s legacy. However, closure lacks felt cost—the reef’s death and battlefield scars are asserted but never dramatized, so the “price” of renewal feels unearned. The final image is resonant but floats above consequence; no option is foreclosed, no stamina spent, no sacrifice shown. Orientation is clear early, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but falters in causal escalation: the riddle’s solution arrives via convenient discovery (phonograph cylinder) without prior setup or failure. The wax orb triggers revelation but exerts no real pressure—it’s a passive token, not a constraint. Closure offers Earned Stasis (peace at the spring), yet cost is vague; no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The Orientation Test passes cleanly, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood through repeated images (stars, compass, silence), but closure lacks a legible cost: Aria’s “first step” incurs no visible or felt sacrifice, undermining Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The flickering light functions as coincidence that complicates but doesn’t test her; the compass alignment feels symbolic rather than causal. Orientation is clear early, but the ending reweights nothing with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyrical buildup to a Charged Poise closure—the sky stabilizes, the spire sings—but the decisive act (swapping chess pieces) is summarized, not dramatized. No felt cost appears: Moonwhisper exits unscathed, and the world’s “unraveling” stakes vanish without consequence. Orientation is strong, but escalation lacks narrowing of options or irreversible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (chessboard, walking pattern, “luminous absence”). However, closure lacks legible cost: the “new narrative” is asserted but no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The inciting figure’s appearance functions as deus ex machina rather than organic escalation. While the whispering gallery’s acoustics are noted, they don’t shape decisions or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the seer wanders, finds the stone, touches it, and “seeds a new reality” with no meaningful tightening or foreclosed path. The closure—a reconfigured bookstore—is asserted, not earned through prior causality. No felt or conceptual cost is legible in the ending; the transformation feels decorative. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but even by that standard, the density doesn’t intensify to reweight stakes with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned motifs (“woven hush,” threads, labyrinth) deepening toward closure. Orientation is strong by line 30: who (exiled chess tutor), where (time-frozen village), when (after thunder stills the world). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he forgives himself, and the village stirs—a legible before/after. Yet cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is dramatized, only implied through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building poetic density until the mist parts—a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the cost of forgiveness remains conceptual, not felt; no on-page forfeiture or altered option makes the price legible. The ritual looms but exerts no tactical pressure, functioning as backdrop rather than active constraint. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern pays off, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (acid sea, creaking workshop, pockmarked statue) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—meaning conjured from oblivion. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kaelin’s gasp and smile reconfigure stakes with legible emotional cost (near-death exertion). However, the “dire enchantment” dissolving lacks causal grounding—it vanishes without resistance, softening the cost’s durability.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the “wrong turn” is unmotivated coincidence, not a consequence of prior action or choice, and the hidden oasis appears as deus ex machina rather than earned discovery. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens is ambiguous—Accumulative/Textural in tone, yet structured like Causal without cause/effect. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing (“temporary eternity”), but cost is asserted, not dramatized; no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails the Orientation Test waiver: disorientation isn’t taught early nor paid off at closure. More critically, there is no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—only mood. Elian ends as he began: tending the garden, unchanged in action or circumstance. The climax is summarized, not dramatized, leaving stakes untested and closure absent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density through recurring motifs (censer foot, moon phases, cryptic calls) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis at dawn. Orientation is clear by line 2 (who: patchwork navigator; where: starlit signal station; when: post-disaster), and the reverse migration culminates in a charged poise—the empty plain as acceptance. However, the “cryptic phone calls” lack dramatized mechanics; they’re narrated as plot devices rather than tested or failed attempts, weakening causal pressure. Cost is felt (irreversible loss) but not visibly paid through a specific forfeiture or error.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is attempted as Charged Poise (“resolve to forge a new path”), but the cost is conceptualized, not felt or visible on the page—no foreclosed option, no sacrifice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation lacks a decisive intensification: each discovery (eye, messages, book) repeats the same beat of passive unearthing without narrowing options. The smuggled relic’s “dark history” is summarized, not dramatized, breaking causality. Orientation is clear, but pressure dissipates into thematic reverie instead of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive intensification: the boutonnière appears mid-scene without prior setup, and the “borrowed memories” concept arrives as exposition, not pressure. Closure leans toward Conceptual Repricing (CR) via the lighthouse as memory repository, but cost is asserted (“weight of memories”) rather than shown through a foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice. No meaningful tightening occurs—the stranger leaves, Kael picks up the flower, and nothing changes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation relies on coincidence (ants leading to cavern) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The creek’s rise functions as backdrop, not a tightening constraint that alters tactics. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing via the father’s note, yet cost remains abstract—no path is foreclosed, no resource lost. Orientation is clear early, but causal links between chip, ants, and cavern feel decorative, not motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the queen moves from grotto to ridge to ember grotto without meaningful tightening of options or deepening of stakes. The closure claims a “truth… that would change her forever,” but this revelation is off-page and costless—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs within the text. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), but the drive lens remains ambiguous—Accumulative/Textural in prose, yet aspiring to Causal structure without linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—is undermined by static progression: the shell reveals “hidden patterns” via passive observation, not density increase or cadence shift. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (“density of presence”), but cost is asserted, not dramatized; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The whispered phrase acts as deus ex machina, not earned intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Disorientation is not taught early nor paid off at closure; “chronologically confused” remains a label without functional narrative consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a decisive intensification—writing merely continues until it stops. Closure offers Charged Poise (peace via creation), but cost is asserted, not shown: no tangible loss, trade-off, or foreclosed path is legible on the page. The grave inciting incident vanishes after paragraph three, breaking causal continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page. Elara departs unchanged—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized with cost. The fog and clocks create mood, not pressure; the ending offers lyrical repetition, not reconfiguration with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and rhythmic cadence, culminating in Charged Poise—the platform drifting into sunset while Kaito holds completed parchment. Cost is legible in the “spent” quill and fading whispers, implying irrevocable expenditure of mystical connection. Orientation is solid by line 30, and closure reweights stillness as generative. However, escalation relies on atmospheric thickening alone—no narrowing of options or knowledge shift alters tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Charged Poise closure: Lyra’s message sent, peace felt, orchard still standing. However, the “induced currents” resolution is asserted, not dramatized—no causality links action to outcome. Cost is implied (sorrow for the orchard, severed friendship) but not made legible through consequence. The hush before destruction frames tension but doesn’t tighten Lyra’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the accumulation lacks pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. Orientation is clear early, yet the “universe’s hiccup” functions as deus ex machina rather than a pressure-coherent device. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“cosmic illusions unraveled”), but cost is asserted, not shown—no sentence makes loss or sacrifice legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repetition, but fails to deliver a true closure unit: there is no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers stasis without sacrifice—“ever vigilant and always counting”—which reads as continuation, not resolution. Orientation is sound early, but the lack of a charged final image that reweights stakes prevents closure from landing under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Lena observes, reflects, and concludes without a decisive turn that narrows options or alters knowledge through action. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern fails to intensify—images repeat without deepening stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“interconnected web”), yet no on-page cost (emotional, social, or opportunity) is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the pattern isn’t taught early enough—subway scrawls appear mid-narrative without setup. Orientation is clear (library, rain, midsummer), but the structure lacks a meaningful tightening: insights accumulate without altering tactics or stakes in a causally legible way. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“Certainty is a shadow…” reweights addiction as futile quest), yet the cost remains abstract—no felt sacrifice or irreversible choice anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost—“peace” and “community” are asserted, not dramatized. The loop pattern is noted but never tightens into pressure; calls repeat without escalation or narrowing of options. Orientation is clear early, but the ending offers stasis without foreclosed paths or conceptual repricing that carries price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks causality: nothing happens because of anything else. It’s a lyrical accumulation without escalation or decisive change. The closure is merely atmospheric repetition (“the jetty continued to bloom”)—no Resonant Reconfiguration, Decisive Change, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The “regenerated covenant” is mentioned but never dramatized or tested, leaving stakes inert.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: rumor chains seed communal connection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Raven accepts that belonging emerges from shared vulnerability, not magic. Cost is felt—their lifelong loneliness lifts only after giving the rock’s myth away—but the causal mechanics of the rumor chain remain vague, weakening escalation. The closure lands with emotional weight, though the “shift in reality’s fabric” verges on unearned mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the stillpoint. Orientation is strong by line 30—blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, platinum ring. However, closure lacks a legible *cost*: the “quiet blaze” illuminates but doesn’t foreclose or sacrifice anything concrete. The constellations shift, but no opportunity is lost; the emotional labyrinth remains metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: cosmic whispers, the pen, and garden failure layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is solid by line 3. However, causality is soft—the gravitational anomaly “responds” without established rules, and the pen’s power remains untested, reducing narrative pressure. Cost is conceptual (failed garden as necessary step) but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks causal tightening or meaningful deepening—events accrue without narrowing options or raising cost. Closure attempts Charged Poise via the final image, but no legible before/after reconfiguration occurs; the harbor remains unchanged in function. The advisor vanishes without consequence, undercutting any felt or conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, but pressure never coheres into a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Elian enters, sees objects, creates art, and leaves—no meaningful tightening of options or deepening of stakes. The vandalized portrait is noted but never investigated; the “hidden message” appears without earned discovery. Closure is declared (“a tale of art, of love…”) rather than dramatized, offering Conceptual Repricing only in summary, not image. No on-page cost is legible—the archive remains untouched by consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure—Charged Poise—is legible: Aria accepts fleeting connection while committing to return. However, cost is implied (“memories will fade”) but never made visible or felt in action; the lagoon dims, but nothing is lost or foreclosed. Orientation is clear by line 2, but escalation lacks a decisive tightening—drumming intensifies, yet no option narrows or knowledge shifts. The “hush of the universe” serves as atmospheric punctuation, not a causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recurring objects build toward a Charged Poise closure. However, the climax—the whispered exchange—lacks causal pressure; the stranger appears coincidentally, not as a consequence of the worker’s actions. Cost is implied (“whispers travel farther”) but never dramatized as loss or sacrifice. The geomagnetic storm and labyrinth setting frame mood but don’t constrain decisions, weakening escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks causality: the shutter-weaving and mirror reveal feel decorative, not consequential. Closure attempts Charged Poise via lingering atmosphere, yet no on-page cost or reconfiguration is legible—stars twinkle, but the guardian’s stance is unchanged. The “half-spoken secret” remains abstract, failing the Cost Proof Test. Orientation is clear early, but pressure never tightens into meaningful stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: events unfold as a sequence of declarations (“Elian realized… conceived a plan… made his way”) rather than motivated actions with consequences. The closure offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—the town transforms magically overnight with zero visible trade-off. Orientation is clear, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails because density increases without pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a Conceptual Repricing (“the island is a state of being”)—lacks on-page cost; Kael returns unchanged in circumstance, bearing no tangible loss or sacrifice. The whale’s call acts as deus ex machina, resolving inner tension without prior causal buildup. Orientation is clear early, but the climax substitutes sensory immersion for dramatized turning point, leaving the “decisive change” abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (bouquet, turbines, whittling) and cadence shifts in narration. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final whisper reweights silence as narrative endurance, with conceptual cost in Echo’s unreadable eyes and swallowed farmhouse. However, the “remade hush” and “lightness in grief” remain asserted rather than dramatized, weakening felt cost. No decisive physical act, but the final image carries quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering rather than causal pressure. Orientation is clear early (who: Lyra; where: cobalt atrium by frozen lake; when: post-ban), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks legible cost: the “dissolving boundaries” yield transformation without sacrifice, making the Resonant Reconfiguration feel weightless. The final image glows but forecloses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation; events accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes. The “bartered awakenings” concept appears late and doesn’t drive decisions—it’s asserted, not enacted. Closure is a static image (Charged Poise) but carries no felt cost: no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The phoenix reference remains decorative, failing to anchor time or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (lab, bell ringer, post-grid-stabilization), but the story lacks causal escalation—it accumulates atmosphere without tightening stakes or foreclosing options. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; it concludes in stasis, not earned poise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image (“simply smiled”) fails to reweight prior material with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: celestial alignment via origami subtly intensifies the curtains’ glow, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the maker accepts healing as ongoing craft. Orientation is solid by line 30—“timeless observatory,” “mourning jewelry maker”—and the closure image (stars behind them as they step out) reweights prior sorrow with earned hope. However, the causal link between origami figures and stellar movement lacks concrete demonstration; it’s asserted, not dramatized, weakening the escalation’s tactile logic. Cost is felt emotionally but remains abstract, not anchored in a specific forfeiture or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (who: cartomancer; where: rain-beaded skylight loft; when: post-cryptocurrency crash), satisfying the test. However, the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation lacks a decisive deepening or cadence shift—pressure remains static. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (cards reveal “subtle interplay between cultural patterns and crashes”), but the cost is conceptual only and never felt or visible on the page. No path is foreclosed; she simply stops working at dawn, unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (pagoda, nostalgia, twilight). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the historian reweights her understanding of nostalgia and knowledge. However, the pivotal turn—using the pagoda—relies on exposition (“avoid patterns”) rather than dramatized causality, weakening the escalation’s agency. Cost is felt but not concretely legible in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (stone, shadow, footage) toward a Conceptual Repricing: the shadow is humanity’s collective fear. Orientation is clear by line 3. However, closure lacks a decisive cost—her realization is liberating but consequence-free; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The final image glows, but stakes dissolve into ambiance rather than sharpening into Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure fails the required test: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost appears on the page. Lena’s “re-emergence” of purpose is asserted, not dramatized; the ending offers stasis without foreclosed paths or charged poise. The “con” backstory remains vague and unanchored, creating orientation drift by ~120 words that isn’t repurposed for closure. No tightening alters options—only mood deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure meaningfully—Elian digs, the plants whisper, the hourglass pulses, yet no tightening occurs. The “breakthrough” into the chamber lacks causal weight; nothing changes except setting brightness. Closure is asserted (“sense of closure wash over them”) rather than dramatized with cost or reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, but the ending offers no legible before/after shift under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory and emotional density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing where love’s endurance outweighs loss. Orientation is clear by line 30. Closure lands via CR—the realization that goodbye letters are “a testament to the enduring power of love”—with conceptual cost (the weight of unused love absorbed into the self). However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the journey through letters feels atmospheric rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via renewed purpose). However, closure lacks visible or conceptual cost: the dreamer gains creativity without loss, sacrifice, or foreclosed path. The aurora intensifies and stardust whispers, but these are ambient, not causal pressures that narrow options. No decisive tightening occurs—only passive reception.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the dune’s glow and archive’s pulse building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, causality is weak: the chess clock’s reactivation lacks setup or constraint, functioning as a deus ex machina. Cost is implied (“ashes,” “charred remains”) but not legible in Asa’s personal stakes or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear early (steel trees, gear, translocation), satisfying the test. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the rainforest becomes a “gateway.” However, cost is conceptual but not felt; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option anchors the transformation. The hum crescendos to “roar” then fades without irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure at dawn’s shore. However, the ending offers no legible cost: the “threshold of a new world” implies continuation, not reconfiguration with sacrifice. The vigil, star stamps, and ridgeway accumulate mood but not consequence—nothing is foreclosed, lost, or irrevocably altered. Without felt or conceptual cost in the final image, closure fails the required standard.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dust discoloration, snow, silence), but fails to deliver a decisive closure unit with legible cost. The ending offers Earned Stasis in name only—no path is visibly foreclosed, and the “renewal” feels asserted rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear early (bellhop in cobalt fortress during snow), but the inciting incident (door creak, bench tightening) lacks causal linkage to the protagonist’s arc. Cost remains conceptual (“price of voice”) without on-page manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterned annotations building toward revelation, satisfying closure via Conceptual Repricing: the library becomes a beacon of truth. However, the climax is summarized (“began to speak… true nature was revealed”) rather than dramatized, flattening causality. Cost is implied (empty ink pellet) but not viscerally felt in the decisive moment. Orientation is strong early, but pressure dissipates in the telling of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood through recurring images (drum, atlas, tides), but closure lacks decisive cost or reconfiguration. The “realization” that truth resides in sea rhythms is asserted, not dramatized, and the torn atlas page remains a static symbol. Orientation is clear early, yet the narrative drifts without meaningful tightening—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The ending offers lyrical stasis, not Charged Poise or Earned Stasis with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stargazer reorients toward action, the spaceport reframed from symbol of defeat to prelude of renewal. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the hum’s crescendo deepens thematic density and reweights stakes. However, the stone circle’s mechanics appear without prior signal, functioning as deus ex machina rather than earned discovery; this weakens causal integrity despite lyrical payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure fails the Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration test: no visible or felt cost anchors Akira’s transformation. The drive lens is ambiguous—Accumulative in texture but Causal in structure—yet neither tightens pressure coherently. Key beats (kite decoding, embryo retrieval) lack causal linkage; plants’ agitation doesn’t alter tactics. Orientation is clear, but causality dissolves into thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density until the final image of smoothed photograph and stilled trees delivers Earned Stasis—a credible closure with felt cost (the relinquishing of perpetual tension). Orientation is solid by line 30, though the drone strike backstory arrives early enough to avoid disorientation penalties. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening: the sea and trees soothe, but no live option is foreclosed or trade-off made—peace arrives as gift, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure lacks decisive cost: the “redesign of perception” is asserted, not earned through causally linked beats. The tarot box’s reassembly isn’t shown as a physical act with stakes—only described metaphorically. Orientation is clear early (artist in lighthouse library), but the ending offers Conceptual Repricing without felt consequence. No path is foreclosed; the darkness is embraced without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of disappearing ink and drone-assisted perception build toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) of time’s nature. Closure lands with Kael’s epiphany and shared understanding, though the cost remains oblique—felt more as intellectual satisfaction than tangible loss. Orientation is clear early; causality holds, but escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with on-page cost. The ending asserts transformation (“the world above... would never be the same”) without dramatizing consequence or foreclosing a path. No visible or conceptual price is paid by Aria—her shift from archivist to “guardian” is declared, not earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through recurring images (roses, stone, sword), but closure lacks a decisive reconfiguration with legible cost. The ending offers Earned Stasis, yet the price of Aria’s choice—what she sacrifices by not wielding the sword—is never rendered visible or felt on the page. Orientation is clear early, but the narrative accumulates mood without meaningful tightening; the oasis thrives unchallenged. No beat narrows options or alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern breaks, cadence shifts, and sensory layering build toward a Conceptual Repricing—the goddess’s echo reweights silence as sound. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fisher’s stillness crystallizes her connection, with cost implied in the garden’s spent energy and her departure at dawn. However, the “zigzag” and constellations mirror without causal consequence, weakening escalation’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Adelaide receives a call, picks up a pen, and decides to use “proof by contradiction”—but no actual test, reversal, or narrowing of options occurs on the page. The closure is thematic assertion (“truth within her grasp”) without Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes cost legible. The drive lens is ambiguous (Accumulative/Textural?), but pressure never tightens beyond atmospheric swirl.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist confronts her guilt, quiets the “haunted firmware,” and achieves peace—but the causal chain is thin. The inciting anomaly (whispers in firmware) resolves too neatly via metaphor rather than character-driven action, and the time-folding moment lacks concrete consequence. Orientation is strong early, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though escalation leans on atmosphere over pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with mist, tile, and mandala accruing resonance toward a Conceptual Repricing: meaning emerges from chaos. Orientation is clear by line 30. However, closure lacks legible cost—the “lilac unease” dissipates too cleanly into peace without sacrifice. The tile’s message catalyzes insight but doesn’t force a trade-off; resolution feels granted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic resonance toward a Conceptual Repricing: the plaza is redefined through naming. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Aria’s declaration changes nothing materially, and no path is foreclosed. The “renaming” is asserted, not enacted with consequence; the air “vibrates,” but stakes remain abstract. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), but pressure never tightens into a decisive turn that alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and echo motifs intensify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands with felt cost—Echo vanishes, timeline repaired—but the “fractured timeline” premise isn’t dramatized causally; repair occurs via ambient magic rather than character-driven cause/effect. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when anchored by line 3), and the tarot coin’s return charges the ending. However, the lack of tangible stakes or narrowing options undercuts pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering, but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers stasis, not earned endurance—nothing is lost, refused, or irrevocably altered. The telepathy pill recall is mentioned but never pressures a choice; the static shock acts as deus ex machina, not causal escalation. No decisive narrowing of options occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with cost. The ending offers mood, not closure: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible consequence. The “voice of the unknown” claim is asserted, not dramatized through loss or choice. Emotional floatation replaces causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: prophecy becomes “raw possibility” through shared wisdom. However, the “truth unraveling” lacks causal pressure—events accumulate but don’t narrow options or force trade-offs. The final image resonates, but cost remains abstract (“work was far from over”) without on-page forfeiture or irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors are clear early (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring), but the plot operates as a sequence of atmospheric tableaux rather than causal or accumulative pressure. The “codes in accumulated snow” premise is introduced but never dramatized—she simply finds a path without struggle or failure. The closure—a mirrored self joining her—is visually resonant but unmotivated by prior action; it functions as symbolic convenience rather than earned reconfiguration. No visible cost forecloses a path; peace arrives without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, needle, gutters, and promise layer into a resonant atmosphere that culminates in a Charged Poise closure—the ferry reaching shore as fog lifts. Cost is implied (eternal waiting, worn patience) but never made concrete or irreversible; no path is foreclosed, only suspended. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of sensory detail pays off in the final image. However, the traveler’s arrival functions as coincidence rather than consequence of the coachman’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: places resist change due to infused kindness. However, closure lacks felt cost—Akira gains insight without loss, sacrifice, or foreclosed path. The “fractured timelines” concept is evoked but never dramatized as pressure that alters options. Disorientation is waived (functional at closure), but escalation is tonal, not causal or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure takes the form of Earned Stasis—the gardener endures and renews care—but cost is implied, not shown. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mood and imagery deepen, yet escalation lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options. The rosebush’s petal drop initiates reflection, not consequence; the boat and tooth enrich atmosphere but don’t pressure change. Final image resonates but lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure fails the required cost test: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible price appears on the page. Lyra’s “new understanding” is asserted, not dramatized; the sundial remains un-deciphered, and her role unchanged. The Orientation Test is passed early, but the ending offers stasis without sacrifice—Earned Stasis requires foreclosed options, which are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (lotus temple, nest spiral, prismatic quiet) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: connection is created, not found. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—Lena’s shift from solitary seeker to collaborative creator—but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The transition from observation to participation lacks causal friction; the artists’ arrival feels convenient, not pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Lyra tunes dials, hears a hum, decodes a message, and wins—all without resistance, failure, or narrowing options. The “cosmic tricksters” exert no on-page pressure, making the resolution feel declarative rather than earned. Closure is asserted (“reports dwindled”) but not dramatized with felt cost or reconfiguration under any coherent drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—but the causal chain is weak. Lyra’s discovery hinges on passive reception (following music, touching crystal) rather than active choice under constraint. The “spatial mutiny” lacks mechanics or stakes; reality tears “asunder” without consequence or resistance. Cost is implied (“wistful rebellion”) but not legible in action or forfeiture—closure leans on abstraction over dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through mist, mask fragment, and brushstrokes. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: truth is reframed as self-understanding, not case resolution. Cost is felt (emotional thaw, renewed purpose) but remains oblique—no concrete forfeiture or irreversible choice on the page. The ribbon’s reappearance charges the ending, though the causal chain between dialogue and transformation lacks tangible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. It ends in suspended inquiry, not closure: Emilia “presses on” without foreclosing a path or crystallizing stakes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the density increase (“spongey dread,” pulsing nail) doesn’t reweight the dominant stake—it merely repeats atmosphere. No tightening alters options; the narrative circles without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the pixelated amnesty appears ex nihilo, the scaffold wrap reveals a secret without setup, and the fiddler’s transformation feels asserted, not earned. Orientation is clear (mountain pullout, fog lifting), but the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—yet accumulation doesn’t intensify pressure; it diffuses into lyrical summary. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (“ashes of ‘never’ reshaped”), but cost isn’t legible—what is lost? What path is foreclosed? The ending floats in epiphany without stakes paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending offers epiphany without consequence: Kael leaves unchanged in behavior, only in mood (“sense of peace”). No option is foreclosed, no price paid—only sentiment accumulates. The closure feels decorative, not decisive, violating the requirement for felt or conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (stars, burdens, telegram) toward a Conceptual Repricing: understanding reweights darkness into manageable weight. Orientation is strong by line 30, and closure lands with Charged Poise—the final image of stars guiding her work crystallizes stakes with felt cost (loneliness eased by cosmic connection). Yet the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the “breakthrough” remains off-page, reducing pressure coherence. The cost is implied but not visibly paid in action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is weak: “swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake” offers poetic vagueness, not spatial or temporal anchors. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a decisive intensification—pressure remains atmospheric, not causal. The ice-shattering moment functions as coincidence, not earned agency, and closure (a CR) lacks visible cost; the revelation has no consequence beyond mood shift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true closure unit: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The “eclipsed covenant” shifts from forgotten promise to “hidden blueprint,” but this reframing lacks consequence—it alters nothing in Aria’s stance or options. The ending offers repetition, not reconfiguration; the glade remains a static symbol, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure takes the form of Earned Stasis: she accepts a transformed self, foreclosing her former despair. However, causality is weak—the spell works by declaration, not consequence, and the “bartered destinies” premise resolves via atmosphere, not action. The Orientation Test passes early, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds only loosely; cost is implied (“dusky resolve”) but not dramatized with concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the phone call interrupts reflection but doesn’t tighten stakes or force a meaningful choice. Closure is attempted as Charged Poise (“launchpad,” “new beginning”), but no felt or conceptual cost is legible—Jack simply decides to feel better. The quarry setting and failed appraisal are mentioned but don’t constrain options or alter tactics. Orientation is clear early, but the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t leveraged to reweight stakes through pattern or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR): Elara realizes “the secret lay not in the individual components, but in the relationships between them.” However, this insight arrives without on-page cost—no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The spirit’s departure creates stillness, but nothing is lost or sacrificed to reestablish balance. The Magnetic Arbor’s harmony returns too easily, violating causal escalation; success feels declared, not earned. Orientation is clear early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation or meaningful tightening; it accumulates atmosphere without pressure. Closure is attempted via Conceptual Repricing (“wonder had become the only constant”), but no felt or visible cost anchors it—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The phrase “after tomorrow disappears” introduces temporal disorientation that isn’t taught early or used to charge the ending. Orientation is clear, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails to reweight stakes with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Aria finds a pearl, feels emotions, listens to a shell, and emerges changed—no tightening of options, no stakes tested, no decisions that foreclose paths. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (pearl as key to human connection), but cost is asserted, not shown; no sentence makes loss or sacrifice legible. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural without sufficient density shift or cadence intensification to reweight the dominant stake meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure meaningfully; it accumulates mood without deepening stakes. No tightening occurs—Elara arrives, reflects, plays accordion, leaves. The closure offers Charged Poise (walking forward), but cost is asserted (“weight lifted”) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear early, yet the lack of a decisive turn or narrowing of options prevents true escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (veil, watch, cipher) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the library is a state of being. However, the closure lacks legible cost—the dreamer is “forever changed” but nothing is lost, foreclosed, or paid for on the page. The inciting object (the watch) appears abruptly without setup, and the “propagation delays” method is asserted, not dramatized, weakening causal integrity within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story fails the Orientation Test: though setting and character are named early, the causal chain is absent—Elian’s “journey” is declared, not enacted, and the ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but accumulation lacks a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes. Closure is aspirational summary, not earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through auroral light, gemstone resonance, and meditative focus until the emerald chip becomes a vessel of transcendence. Closure takes the form of Charged Poise: Aria’s readiness to cross the threshold is reconfigured by her successful infusion, with conceptual cost legible in the “pang of sorrow” and deferred oblivion. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 2 (“skyborne grotto… Aria prepared”), and the pattern pays off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true closure with legible cost: Aria’s “contentment” arrives without foreclosing any path or incurring visible sacrifice. The antique hairpin’s revelation is conceptual but lacks a decisive change in behavior or circumstance—she simply continues tending plants. Orientation is clear early, but the absence of escalation (no tightening, reversal, or deepening that alters options) undermines structural momentum. The ending offers stasis, not Earned Stasis, because no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present by line 30, satisfying the test, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—leaning Accumulative/Textural yet mimicking Causal structure without causal linkage. The “unhooking” climax is summarized, not dramatized, breaking causality: no visible act alters the client’s state. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks legible cost; the client’s transformation is asserted, not shown. Wind chimes and mirror shard function as decorative motifs, not causal agents.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story lacks causal linkage: meditation → revelation occurs by assertion, not pressure-driven progression. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the “trance” deepens but alters nothing tactically. Closure is a static mutual gaze—Earned Stasis or Charged Poise fails because no path is foreclosed and no cost is legible. Orientation is clear, but causality evaporates under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clear early (canyon, skimmer, arrowhead), but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—is undermined by static progression: dust falls, birds fly, understanding deepens, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights stakes. Closure attempts Earned Stasis but fails the cost proof test—no on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path is legible. The pulse’s integration feels decorative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: creativity’s sacredness lies in simplicity. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Eira gains inspiration but forfeits nothing visible or felt. The inciting discovery and keystone interaction are smooth but consequence-free; the “rebirth” is asserted, not earned through narrowing options or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure or deepen stakes meaningfully. Orientation is clear early (pier lamplighter, sunken ship, lantern festival), yet the plot drifts without tightening—no option is foreclosed, no cost incurred. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (“color of sound is real”) but offers no felt or conceptual price; the “discovery” lacks consequence. The meteor hush and lantern glow create mood, not narrative turning.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the backwards prophecy is declared but never tested or altered by action; the distillation yields insight without struggle or consequence. Orientation is clear early (ambered deck, post-contraction universe), but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—is undermined by repetitive, static description rather than pattern break or cadence shift. Closure is attempted as Conceptual Repricing (“wavelength aligned with purpose”), but cost is absent; the stars brighten, yet nothing is lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: echoes intensify into crystallized sea monsters, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the reaper achieves melancholic peace. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who, where, when). However, the closure’s cost—“a sense of peace”—lacks concrete, felt consequence; the emotional shift is asserted more than dramatized, weakening the cost legibility required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building lyrical density toward a resonant final image—the bell’s toll—but lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses options or raises stakes. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s restoration reweights “brittle devotion” as malleable, yet cost remains abstract (no visible loss, time, tool, or stamina). The ritual proceeds without complication, undercutting pressure; the cosmic imbalance is declared but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the story lacks a decisive tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with cost. The ending offers mood, not closure: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs—only reiterated intent. The sapphire label and photographs recur but don’t constrain choice or crystallize a before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory density and pattern (starlings, crystal, waterfall) intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights her understanding of harmony through the starlings’ dance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she’s on the “right path,” with cost implied in the humility of recognizing how much remains unknown. However, the inciting incident (finding the crystal) lacks causal buildup; it arrives as serendipity rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of celestial observation and revision builds toward a Conceptual Repricing—her new understanding reweights the mission. However, closure lacks legible cost; the “burden” is named but never felt as loss, sacrifice, or foreclosed path. The dawn erases stars, but Lyra’s work is complete without friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks a discernible drive lens: it gestures toward Accumulative/Textural but fails to deepen or intensify pressure meaningfully. The closure is an epiphany without decisive change, reconfiguration, or repricing—Kaito simply feels better. No on-page cost is legible; the brain in the jar fades without consequence. Orientation is clear, but causality evaporates into ambient meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the seed arrives, she ponders, then creates—no narrowing of options, no failed attempts, no stakes tested. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the accumulation is thematic repetition, not pressure. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (the seed reweights as creative catalyst), but cost is asserted (“gratitude,” “anticipation”), not dramatized. No path is foreclosed; nothing is lost, only gained—undercutting closure’s required cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The “restored laughter” feels asserted, not earned—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page. The hourglass metaphor is introduced redundantly (“after the final grain slips… after the final grain slips”), muddying temporal logic and undermining structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a shift from unease to peace—lacks a decisive cost or reconfiguration that forecloses a path. The “veil of sleep” and mist-clearing serve as mood shifts, not earned transformations with stakes. No visible or conceptual price is paid; the burden lifts without sacrifice. The Orientation Test is passed early, but the ending offers resonance without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the alchemist’s new path replaces foretold stagnation, and the twisted crozier embodies rebirth. However, causality is accumulative-textural without sufficient tightening—pressure builds atmospherically but lacks a pivotal choice that narrows options. The “penny drops” moment is declared, not dramatized through cause/effect. Cost is implied (“awe and trepidation”) but never made legible as opportunity, tool loss, or social consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost: the “truth” remains vague, and Aria’s transformation is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation is sound early, but the plot lacks causal pressure—discoveries arrive via resonance, not choice. The cryptic message functions as exposition, not a turning point that narrows options. Final image offers mood, not reconfiguration with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page—only a vague intention to “step into the unknown.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the accumulation lacks a decisive intensification; the grotto discovery merely restates the premise without narrowing options or imposing cost. Orientation is clear, but the ending offers no legible before/after or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns intensify until the climax, where light and thread culminate in a Charged Poise closure. However, cost is implied but never legible—an “unseen” price undermines closure validity. The Orientation Test is waived (disorientation serves theme), but the ending’s stasis lacks a decisive foreclosed path or tangible consequence, falling short of CR or Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening: the lesson proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or deepening that narrows options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“city transformed into a launchpad”), yet cost is asserted (“sense of pride”) not dramatized—no foreclosed path or felt price. The anchor chain reappears symbolically but doesn’t alter tactics or stakes. Orientation is clear early, but pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, hearing aid pulses, and photograph layer to create emotional density. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the woman finds peace, mist clears—but the cost is oblique, not felt in Aria’s body or choices. Orientation is clear early; however, the causal link between hearing aid pulses and the girl’s spirit remains unexplained, relying on atmospheric suggestion over dramatized logic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: Lyra emerges changed, revaluing the cables’ meaning. However, the tidal deadline creates urgency without real narrowing of options—she retrieves the codex effortlessly, and phase travel works on first try. Cost is implied (“changed,” “connection stronger”) but never legible as concrete loss; the “crashing hush” crescendo substitutes sensory overload for consequential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through layered images (snow, ink, shard, static) toward a Conceptual Repricing: wisdom emerges from failure, not truth. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the ghost’s whisper reweights Akira’s quest—but the cost is oblique, implied only through mood, not dramatized loss. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the radio static’s clearing serves as functional temporal anchor, though escalation relies on ambiance over causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon gains a new language, reweighting silence into resonance. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening—pressure accumulates but never narrows options or forces a renunciation. The flawed diamond’s “curse transformed to blessing” implies change but carries no felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the arrowhead, phone, and “missing return changed” are introduced without setup or payoff logic. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (“harmony untamed”), but cost is asserted, not shown—no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice appears on the page. Disorientation is never taught as functional; anchors (timeframe, stakes) remain vague past the 120-word mark without closure payoff, triggering an Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: music builds density until it cracks the statues’ stone forms. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the orchard reborn, Luna departing with renewed purpose. Cost is conceptual (the world’s mechanical grip loosened) but not felt viscerally; no on-page sacrifice deepens stakes. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality holds within the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clear early (mailman, cobalt arcade, twilight), but causality falters: the drone border threat is asserted, not dramatized, and the “linking absences” method is mentioned without mechanics or consequence. The climax—a swift handoff in an alley—resolves via coincidence (drone distracted by “stray signal”), not protagonist agency. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“storm of hope”), but cost is asserted, not shown; no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a serene return to work—lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The carpenter’s “newfound purpose” is asserted, not earned through prior causality or sacrifice. The singer vanishes without consequence, and the oasis functions as decorative detour, not a crucible. No path is foreclosed; no price is paid—only mood accumulates, then dissipates at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands: stories reawaken, and the librarian finds peace—but the cost is implied, not legible on the page. No option is foreclosed; no price is paid beyond time spent. The pattern is coherent, yet the absence of tangible consequence limits closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation or decisive change; it accumulates imagery without tightening stakes or altering options. Closure is attempted as Conceptual Repricing (“luminous absence… spoke its secrets”), but no cost is legible—the dream remains unaltered, and Elian’s routine repeats unchanged. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. The ending mirrors the beginning, offering stasis without sacrifice or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the released idea transforms the environment, reweighting cosmic possibility. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: enigmatic locksmith; where: shadowed nexus; when: twilight). However, the “lock yielding” functions more as symbolic gesture than causally earned turn—no prior mechanics establish how starlight or hair-lock logic operates, making the resolution feel atmospheric rather than inevitable. Cost is implied (“piece of themselves”) but not dramatized with specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at closure; it ends in anticipation, not consequence. While atmosphere is rich, the inciting incident (finding the mushroom) doesn’t trigger escalation—it merely confirms intent. The “decades later” reflection violates the BRR policy by introducing off-page consequence without anchoring it in present action, flattening causality. No on-page cost is paid; the ending offers resolve, not reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (tea leaves, shadow, swing) until the final Charged Poise: the archivist’s realization reconfigures the soul’s exile as reversible. Cost is legible in the easing tension and subsiding habit—embodied stakes paid through emotional labor. Orientation is clear by line 30; closure lands with conceptual weight. No causality breaks, though escalation relies more on lyrical intensification than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere over causality, but closure lacks legible cost: the world transforms without sacrifice or consequence. Aria plants a seed and weaves magic—no obstacle, reversal, or narrowing of options occurs. The “radiant hush” ending offers mood, not Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. Orientation is clear early, but escalation is decorative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence deepens, light intensifies, and spirits dissipate as knots unravel—a coherent pattern that culminates in Earned Stasis (spirits grounded, restorer renewed). However, the closure lacks visible cost; peace arrives too cleanly, with no forfeiture or consequence tied to the final image. The “lucid unrest” noted at the end gestures toward tension but doesn’t manifest as legible stakes paid.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of rain, stone, silence, and video analysis build density toward a Conceptual Repricing—maps as vessels of silence. However, closure lacks legible cost; Elara gains awe and wholeness without loss, forfeiture, or endurance. The “map tears” threshold is evocative but not tied to a decisive renunciation or trade-off. Orientation is clear early, but escalation relies on atmospheric thickening rather than narrowing options or raising stakes through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned images (snow globe, transmission, knots) accrue meaning toward a Conceptual Repricing—“To let go is not to release, but to reframe.” Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure lands with poetic resonance, though the “last transmission” revelation leans interpretive rather than dramatized. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, storm, symbols, and hum coalesce into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the mural remains, the courtyard is changed, and the balladeer departs with new understanding. Cost is felt (her departure, the storm’s toll) though not sharply visible; the ghost’s response carries emotional weight. Orientation is clear early (“misty courtyard above clouds”), and the pattern of encoding → response → transformation holds. However, escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and emotional resonance through repeated motifs. However, the closure—while tonally cohesive—lacks a decisive cost or reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible. The elevator ascent/descent frames the journey but no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The final understanding feels earned thematically but not dramatized through causal or pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost occurs. Lyra ends in peace, but nothing is lost, refused, or reconfigured—only affirmed. The phrase “after the string breaks” introduces a mythic framework that isn’t dramatized or paid off causally. Final stasis feels unearned because no option was ever truly at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the portrait captures “a fragment of the infinite,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the futility of finite containment). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via coin, safe, and canvas until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30; demolition clock tightens stakes without resolving via coincidence. However, the “decisive change” lacks a tangible on-page sacrifice—cost is felt but not dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and pattern, but fails to deliver on-page Closure: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. Eli ends exactly as they began—poring over charts—now merely “ready” to act, with zero felt or conceptual cost. The luminance’s glow intensifies, but this is decorative, not consequential. Without a legible before/after or charged poise that crystallizes stakes, the ending floats, violating the closure requirement for publishable short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the ending offers only abstract realization (“secrets of the universe were now within their grasp”) without legible cost or reconfiguration of options—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The hall of mirrors appears magically without earned discovery, and the prophecy functions as deus ex machina rather than a constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is strong early, but causality dissolves into lyric drift.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but causality is weak: Aria’s plan unfolds without resistance, setbacks, or meaningful narrowing of options. The chalked messages trigger instant communal decoding with no friction. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (planet transformed), yet cost is abstract—no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path makes the change feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with closure achieved via Charged Poise: the lullaby deepens the hush, reconfiguring time’s fragility into enduring stillness. Cost is legible in the “burden of bruised awe” and the weight of vigilance, though not dramatized as a concrete forfeiture. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: adjuster; where: lighthouse lantern room; when: dusk). The pattern of nested fragility (puppet, clockwork, universe) tightens meaningfully toward the ending, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: the nut triggers memory, which leads to the blueprint, which enables reactivation. Orientation is solid by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change—the labyrinth glows, travelers are saved—but the cost is underdeveloped; “night frost” threatens but exacts no visible price. The mechanical birds’ role remains ornamental, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory patterns (foam, chrysalis, braided water) accruing symbolic weight toward a Conceptual Repricing: separation reimagined as connection. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image of lingering melody implies reconfigured meaning—but cost remains oblique; the “loosened grief” lacks a specific, felt forfeiture tied to her choice. Structure is coherent, though the single reflective block (~25%) skirts BRR limits without triggering penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure fails the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Ember’s “realization” that stories are woven into the library’s fabric is asserted, not dramatized, and no path is foreclosed—she walks away unchanged except in perception. The bottled moonlight teases stakes but resolves nothing; the glimmering parole remains a metaphor, not a mechanism. Without felt or conceptual cost at the ending beat, closure is decorative, not functional.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (rain-damp walls, coral pavilion, tidal pools). Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Elara endures the flood of remorse and smooths its edges—but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; no specific sacrifice or foreclosed path is dramatized on the page. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern is taught by ~25%.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.7)
    Closure fails the Global Drive Lens test: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending asserts unity (“silos now bridging gaps”) without dramatizing transformation or sacrifice. Causality collapses—Emilia talks, the elevator “responds,” and harmony magically appears. No tightening, trade-off, or foreclosed path grounds the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with felt cost: the mirror’s restoration yields only vague “secrets” and “layers of meaning,” not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. No path is foreclosed, no price paid—Elara simply gains access to more reflection. The ending offers stasis without sacrifice, violating the Closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “seeds of vigilance” shift from metaphor to tangible force, reweighting the story’s premise with conceptual cost (responsibility of knowledge). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring symbols and threshold effects—but causality leans on coincidence (gravity inversion enabling access) rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The final image crystallizes purpose without decisive action, satisfying Charged Poise within short-form constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward Charged Poise closure—the grove now holds a “quiet heartbeat.” Cost is legible (“silence was no longer oppressive”) but subtly rendered. Orientation is clear by line 3. However, the hedgehog event functions as unmotivated backstory rather than active constraint, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation or meaningful tightening; it accumulates atmosphere without pressure that alters options. No Decisive Change, Earned Stasis, or Charged Poise occurs—only a vague sense of “purpose.” The eclipsed covenant and exile are backdrop, not active constraints. Closure fails: no legible before/after or felt cost at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful escalation or cost. The diary opens effortlessly via mystical attunement—a convenience that resolves tension without struggle. Closure is Earned Stasis in form (basking in silence), but no path is foreclosed, no price paid; the fireworks’ delay imposes no real constraint. The lack of causal pressure or tangible stakes undermines narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the structure lacks a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. The “turning of the tide’s thought” functions as deus ex machina, not earned escalation. Closure attempts Earned Stasis but fails the cost test: Lyra gains peace without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The journal and doodles are mentioned but don’t shape the bloom’s outcome, making the ending feel decorative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a causal lens but relies on coincidence (finding the arrow tip, stumbling upon the pool) rather than motivated action to reach its climax. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing—is present (“the echoes were the source”) but cost is abstract (“resonated within her”) rather than visible or felt. The gravity inversion functions as backdrop, not pressure that narrows options. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early (who: investigator; where: shipping container labyrinth; when: post-crash), satisfying baseline clarity. However, the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet closure fails to deliver a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—the ending offers only reaffirmed intent, not reconfiguration. No option is foreclosed; no stance crystallizes beyond “I will keep investigating.” The crash remains unexplained, and the final image lacks charged poise or repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening: the chisel strike functions as a deus ex machina rather than a consequence of Elian’s choices. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (“certifying wonder”), yet cost is asserted, not shown—no foreclosed path, no sacrifice. The amber sheet and cavern shimmer without altering options, rendering the climax decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Charged Poise closure: the keeper stands transformed, flute re-cased, stillness resonant. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who, where, when). However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. Cost is implied (“changed, transformed”) but not legible in action or forfeiture; the flute’s power remains consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the mathematics of emotion become legible. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the vanished stars and swirling text crystallize stakes with conceptual cost (lost cosmic guidance for human insight). However, the “vanishing stars” timeframe lacks causal linkage to Echo’s actions; it functions atmospherically rather than as a tightening constraint that shapes decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repeated motifs (pendant, aurora, ridgeway). However, closure fails the cost test: the final image evokes peace and continuity but shows no foreclosed path, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with legible price. The encounter with the mysterious woman is resonant but consequence-free—no option narrows, no belief shatters, no trade-off occurs. Without felt or conceptual cost, the Resonant Reconfiguration remains unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors are clear early (quartz arbor, mist, car window), but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—is undermined by static progression: the frost patterns yield revelation without resistance, error, or recalibration. No meaningful tightening occurs; the “shattered assumptions” are declared, not dramatized, and cost is asserted (“truthful lies will stay with her”) without on-page consequence. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks legible stakes or reconfiguration—nothing is foreclosed, altered, or paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure takes the form of Charged Poise: the silence becomes a “bridge,” and the spinner departs with resolve. However, the transformation lacks causal scaffolding—her shift from despair to purpose hinges on assembling a jigsaw puzzle, an act presented as metaphorically resonant but causally inert. No live option is foreclosed; the “impossible distance” remains unchanged, and the cost (“sacrifice”) is named but not shown. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the density increase doesn’t reweight stakes with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory motifs (orchard scent, floating arches, mine silence) layer toward a Charged Poise closure—the sword’s completion crystallizes options without decisive action. Cost is implied (“solitude broken,” future trials) but never made visceral or specific on the page; the final image lacks a legible price paid. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30, and the single-scene forge frame holds coherently. However, the escalation lacks a tightening that forecloses a path—everything proceeds smoothly, undercutting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientational anchors (who, where, when) are present early, satisfying the Orientation Test, but the story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens without sufficient pattern intensification or cadence shift to justify its closure. The “revelation” is asserted, not dramatized, and the multiverse traversal reads as montage, not escalating pressure. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost occurs on the page—the ending offers epiphany without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (sea glass, stones, luminescence) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: the skipper’s quiet resolve to protect the lighthouse despite its sorrow. Cost is legible—the “luminescent ache” embodies emotional burden—but the inciting incident (lamp out, letter found) doesn’t causally tighten options; the anonymous letters remain inert. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure fits the word count, though escalation relies on mood rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure: the dawn is shaped, the ritual complete, and the herald departs with purpose. However, no felt or conceptual cost is legible on the page—her labor has no consequence beyond aesthetic satisfaction. The “steering” lacks stakes; nothing is lost, foreclosed, or risked, undermining closure validity despite lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through recurring iridescence motifs, but closure lacks decisive cost. The “realization” about refraction is thematic assertion, not a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible consequence. Orientation is clear early (floating tea house, Kaito, wing), but the ending offers only aesthetic stasis—no foreclosed path, Charged Poise, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. The final image dissolves into mist, evading narrative accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant’s restoration reweights “sorrow” from burden to quantifiable, healable substance, with the moonlit world affirmed as interconnected. However, causality falters—the storm intensifies “in time with the worker’s heartbeat” without clear linkage, and the pin-drop moment feels ornamental, not consequential. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation relies on atmospheric density rather than narrowing options or raising stakes through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the realm “begins to heal.” However, closure lacks tangible cost—light returns, flowers bloom, but nothing is lost or foreclosed. The mica window’s vision offers insight without consequence, making the shift feel decorative rather than decisive. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern is taught, but escalation never tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring motifs, and cadence shifts culminating in Conceptual Repricing—“truth is not in the answer, but in the question.” Closure lands with Earned Stasis: Elys chooses to stay, reinterpreting the invitation as growth, foreclosing escape with quiet cost. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elys; where: secret library; when: approaching midnight). However, the tightening is subtle—midnight functions more as atmosphere than a live constraint—and the “mistake” backstory lacks concrete on-page friction to make the cost fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyrical repetition, but closure lacks decisive cost: the “absolution” is asserted, not dramatized, and no path is foreclosed. Orientation is clear early (palace courtyard, tea house, noticer), satisfying the test. However, the ending offers Charged Poise without visible or conceptual price—gratitude replaces consequence. The vanished bakery and seasonal shift hint at loss but never impose tangible stakes that alter tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows”) and cadence shifts as light fades. However, closure lacks a decisive change or felt cost: Elara returns the slide unchanged, and the “revelation” remains abstract. No path is foreclosed, no price paid—only a sentimentally resonant but consequence-free realization that fails the Closure requirement’s cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The “fragile understanding” between Lena and The Shadow is asserted, not dramatized, and nothing is foreclosed or reconfigured. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal nor accumulative—and the ending offers resolution without consequence. The “mission success” claim contradicts the lack of on-page evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with felt cost. The aurora fades and Aria feels peace, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid—only mood shifts. The inciting premise (seeking truth about weather-carriers) resolves via passive revelation, not earned reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks tightening; events accumulate without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds until the portrait’s completion triggers closure. However, the “decisive change” is conceptual (lock transforms) without visible or felt cost—Elara pays no price for her breakthrough. The lock’s magical transformation reads as symbolic convenience, not earned consequence, weakening closure legitimacy under the required cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: Aria resees New Eden through recovered intimacy. However, the journey lacks causal tightening—discoveries arrive via passive assembly, not active choice under pressure. The zinc plate and map function as props, not catalysts that narrow options. Cost is conceptual (lost past) but not felt in a decisive trade-off or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    No causal escalation or meaningful tightening occurs; the iceberg fragment arrives by coincidence and is seamlessly integrated without complication. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but density increases through repetitive phrasing, not pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“language of the heart will reign”), but cost is asserted, not shown—no foreclosed path, sacrifice, or tangible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (fire, box, dome) and culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Aria accepts containment as peace. However, the causal link between the controlled burn and her psychological resolution feels associative rather than earned—fire cleanses the farm, and by extension her mind, but the mechanism lacks concrete pressure or cost tied to her agency. The magnetic north shift serves as weak temporal scaffolding without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the mailbox commotion leads instantly to full community gossip, the writer is readily accessible, and the locket’s link to the writer is asserted, not dramatized. Closure is thematic (Conceptual Repricing) but cost is abstract—no felt or visible price is paid by Emilia or the writer on the page. The “mystery” resolves via exposition, not character-driven discovery under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page. Aria “feels liberation” after encoding a message, yet no option is foreclosed, no cost is visible, and the laboratory’s constraints vanish without consequence. The spider’s web and dice recur decoratively but don’t tighten pressure or alter outcomes. The ending offers mood, not meaning—no before/after legibility emerges from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: gravity pockets, whale beaching, coffee grounds, and crystal chamber layer into a resonant pattern culminating in memory recovery. Orientation is clear by line 30. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—memories aren’t lost but retrievable—charged by the whale’s presence and the lighter’s altered perception. However, escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the journey feels guided rather than chosen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is solid by line 30, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence deepens, light emerges, dawn arrives. Closure is Earned Stasis—the prophecy is hushed—but cost is asserted, not shown. No path is visibly foreclosed; the summoner expends energy but suffers no tangible loss. The final release feels ceremonial, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that architecture encodes hidden narratives. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure lands via Charged Poise—the student departs with the seal, forever altered—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized (no foreclosed option, no tangible sacrifice). The meteor shower frames the scene poetically but doesn’t escalate pressure causally; it decorates rather than drives.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive tightening or cost that reweights stakes. The “closure” is a series of affirmations (“new beginning,” “sense of purpose”) without foreclosed paths or tangible loss. Key beats—discovery, listening, remembering—are sequential summaries, not causally linked pressures. The final image offers stasis without sacrifice, violating the Closure requirement of felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forged text reweights historical injustice into subversive truth, with auroral light and sanctuary stillness marking earned stasis. However, causality is accumulative/textural, not causal—events unfold as mood-driven impressions rather than because/therefore linkages. The key “with no apparent lock” appears but exerts no mechanical pressure; its function is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is legible (emotional labor, historical reckoning) but not concretely foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward a resonant ending. However, closure lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Aria gains insight but suffers no loss, makes no sacrifice, and the world remains unaltered beyond ambient “peace.” The ending offers mood, not reconfiguration—cost is asserted (“journey far from over”) but not dramatized or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost: the ending offers atmospheric shift (“hope,” “ethereal light”) but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence. The snow globe’s pattern “holds a hidden message,” yet no actionable insight or irreversible understanding alters Aria’s options. Orientation is stable, but escalation is decorative—visions accumulate without narrowing stakes or raising price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear, but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—fails to escalate pressure meaningfully. The story accumulates sensory detail without a decisive deepening or cadence shift that reweights stakes. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (“grasped the truth”), but no on-page cost or foreclosed path makes the change legible. The moon path leads to passive reception, not earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: shredded letters build density toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the stillpoint. However, the CR lacks legible cost—the pulsating glow reweights reality but exacts no felt or conceptual price on Aria. The inciting trail and letter assembly work, but the climax substitutes atmosphere for consequence, leaving the before/after legible only thematically, not causally or emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the narrative accumulates abstractions, not pressure. There’s no decisive tightening—only repetitive assertions of shifting allegiance and rising influence. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing (“variant allegiance now a badge of honor”), but the cost is never felt on the page; the storm subsides neatly, and the prophet’s success arrives off-stage. The lack of causality or stakes tested in-scene weakens structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the poet reclaims purpose through writing, transforming isolation into sanctuary. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory relics (music box, jars) until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Cost is felt conceptually (years of silence, loneliness) but not viscerally dramatized; no concrete forfeiture occurs on-page. Orientation is solid by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure lacks decisive cost: the artifact harmonizes effortlessly, and Azure Coat’s vigilance incurs no tangible sacrifice. No path is foreclosed; the ending offers serene stasis without Charged Poise or Earned Stasis. Orientation is clear early, but the lack of meaningful tightening or consequence prevents higher escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure fails the required test: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost occurs on the page. The “revolution begins” is asserted, not dramatized; the viaduct hums louder, the moon sets—but nothing changes for the character or world with felt consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet accumulation lacks a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes. Orientation is clear early, but the ending offers only atmospheric stasis, not charged poise or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation is diffuse—pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than through narrowing options or deepening stakes. The inscription “Free at last” functions as thematic punctuation, not a causal pivot that alters Maya’s tactics or knowledge. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), yet the cost remains abstract (“controlled by past” vs. concrete forfeiture). No on-page decision forecloses a live path with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clear early (antique shop, chaplain, clockwork heart), but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—fails to escalate pressure meaningfully; the story drifts in reflection without narrowing options or raising stakes. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“redemption is possible”), but cost is asserted, not dramatized: no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The proprietor’s wisdom arrives as deus ex machina, not earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the story lacks a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost; instead, it cycles through repetitive observations (“Zephyr’s understanding expanded… workshop evolved… acid sea churned”). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the bell’s unheard ring as harmony—but offers no legible before/after or felt cost; the workshop simply “becomes harmonious” without sacrifice or constraint. Orientation is clear early (workshop on acid sea), but causality dissolves into ambient reflection without meaningful pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The “truth” Lena uncovers—that files were archived, not deleted—lacks emotional or conceptual stakes and reads as a non-revelation. The cryptic warning (“They’re watching…”) introduces external pressure that vanishes without consequence, undermining causality. No decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration occurs; the ending offers mood, not meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: the crystal’s restoration symbolizes mapping empathy onto the heart’s landscape. However, the “weighted breath before reply” and “shifting ice floes” never exert causal or temporal pressure—the peacekeeper faces no obstacles, delays, or consequences. Cost is implied (“burden of her role”) but never made visible or felt on the page, undermining closure’s required legibility of price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated images (ice, wind, trawling). Orientation is clear early: drift-ice marina, post-suicide-attempt protagonist. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the peace is fragile but legible—but cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; pressure diffuses into lyric reflection rather than escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to escalate pressure meaningfully—there’s no tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) of “destined mismatches,” yet the cost remains conceptual and unanchored in on-page consequence. The love letter fragment introduces potential tension but never forces a choice or alters tactics. Without felt or visible cost tied to a decisive moment, the ending floats in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early, but the inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—is undermined by static progression: the story accumulates description without deepening pressure or narrowing options. The closure is Earned Stasis, but no path is foreclosed and no cost is legible beyond vague emotional labor. The kinetic parapet pulses but nothing is lost, sacrificed, or irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the piece accumulates description without escalating pressure or narrowing options. There is no tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights stakes—only repetitive affirmations of peace. Closure attempts Charged Poise but fails the cost test: no path is foreclosed, no price paid, no before/after legible beyond aesthetic appreciation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scholar steps into the world, crystal in hand, reconfiguring isolation into testimony. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—silence, light, and pattern accrue toward this stance—but the “summoned to testify” inciting incident arrives without prior tension or contextual stakes, weakening causal grounding. Cost is felt (surrendering safety) yet not dramatized through concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, chalk, driftwood, and videotape hush accrue into a resonant final image. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing—the “sound of growing older” shifts from elusive object to felt presence—but the cost remains conceptual, not dramatized. No decisive narrowing of options occurs; the pattern’s erasure by fog undercuts tangible consequence, weakening closure’s legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The clock hand stops arbitrarily without linking to Eli’s actions, and the “earth tremors” vanish without consequence. Orientation is clear early, but the ending offers Conceptual Repricing only through assertion (“transcending the limitations of the self”), not on-page reconfiguration with felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sensory tapestry that culminates in Emma’s peaceful death—a valid Earned Stasis closure. Cost is legible in Emma’s surrender, though Lena’s emotional price remains implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“serene hospice music therapist… above the clouds”). However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening: the blood work triggers no tactical shift beyond continuing what Lena already does.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Lyra reads, connects dots, and understands—no obstacle, reversal, or narrowing of options occurs. The “spoons bending reality” and “shadows at noon” are declared stakes but never concretely tested or interacted with in-scene. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the key as metaphor), but cost is absent—nothing is lost, risked, or refused. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet pattern density doesn’t intensify; it merely accumulates exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails to deliver a decisive closure unit with legible cost. The ending offers thematic resonance (“turn mistakes into constellations”) but no foreclosed path, Charged Poise, or Conceptual Repricing with tangible consequence. Backstory about “the substitute body” is vague and unanchored, creating orientation debt without payoff. The tooth’s “glow” is decorative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost: the ending offers Earned Stasis only in assertion (“heart remained still”), not dramatization. No path is foreclosed, no option narrowed—only repetitive polishing occurs. Memories resurface but never alter present tactics or force a micro-choice, violating BRR. The “pearl of stillness” is named but never tested or reconfigured through action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery (icicle pattern, moss, honeyed hush). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pendant’s meaning shifts from pain to strength, reweighting the past. However, cost remains oblique—no tangible loss or forfeiture is shown; healing arrives via atmosphere and gesture rather than dramatized struggle. The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the story lacks a decisive intensification: the woman’s appearance functions as deus ex machina, not a patterned escalation. Orientation is functional (novelist at feral nexus by line 1), yet closure fails the cost test—no path is foreclosed, no price paid; words simply “flow once more” without tangible sacrifice. The spiral shell and mist recur, but their reweighting is asserted (“imbued with new significance”) rather than dramatized through altered tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a resonant moment, but closure lacks decisive change or felt cost—villagers simply smile, with no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice. The Orientation Test passes cleanly (who/where/when established by line 3), yet escalation is atmospheric, not causal: the device works perfectly on first try, removing tension. The “gathering hush” deepens mood but not stakes; nothing is risked, lost, or irrevocably altered beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail and ritualistic pacing. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the plate pulses with a map, reconfiguring meaning without decisive action. However, cost is implied (“exhaustion”) but never concretely tied to a lost option or irreversible price—undercutting the 9+ gate. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and rhythmic observation, not causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the reactivated clockwork reweights time as harvestable echo—but cost is oblique, not felt or visible on the page. Orientation is clear early (marble cavern, autumnal decay, lone locksmith), satisfying the test. However, the lack of a decisive narrowing of options or tangible price paid weakens escalation under even an accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repeated motifs (shingled hush, whalebone reverie), but lacks a decisive tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with felt cost. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the tapestry reflects inner landscapes—but the cost remains abstract; no path is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The Orientation Test passes early (weaver, bronze grotto, post-snowmelt), yet the plot drifts in lyric stasis without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory density and rhythmic cadence reweighting the dominant stake: containing loss. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the completed carving crystallizes her acceptance—but the cost ("here and gone" as universal truth) is felt only abstractly, not viscerally tied to a foreclosed path. The kettle’s empty silence signals transience but doesn’t concretely alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure—a single photograph capturing “fractured stillness”—functions as Conceptual Repricing: the irretrievable past is acknowledged, yet stories are preserved. Cost is legible (“eroded ambitions,” “forgotten dreams”) and the lagoon’s atmosphere charges the ending. However, the narrative lacks a decisive tightening or deepening beat; accumulation occurs, but without a pivotal shift that reweights stakes mid-text. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern is taught consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: Maya finds a sextant, sees symbols, reroutes pipes, and the terminal revives—all without obstacle, failure, or consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; stakes remain declared (“abandonment,” “hope”) but untested. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) of rebirth, but cost is absent—the terminal glows, machinery hums, yet nothing is lost or foreclosed. Orientation is clear early, but causality dissolves into wishful montage.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure: Elian reinterprets his role. However, the “decisive change” lacks on-page cost—no path is closed, no trade-off made. The bear’s appearance functions as symbolic prompt, not causal pressure. Orientation is clear early, but escalation is atmospheric, not consequential; the sunrise walk resets, not tightens, stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: Lyra finds the sundial because the narrative says so, not through earned discovery. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing but offers no legible cost—her “serene upheaval” feels weightless. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the accumulation is atmospheric, not pressure-driven; nothing tightens or forecloses options. The “twilight barge canal” never functions as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a quiet closure. However, the “decoding” lacks on-page causality: knots yield secrets without struggle, error, or revision. The ending offers Charged Poise (fog-bound departure with knowledge preserved), but cost is implied, not shown—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Orientation is strong, but escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: silence transforms from oppressive to resonant. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the narrator’s shift in perception reconfigures meaning with felt cost (the snapped thread, the acceptance of absence). However, escalation is purely atmospheric; no meaningful tightening of options or stakes occurs beyond mood deepening. The “last ship” establishes temporal closure but exerts no causal pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of light, sound, and mechanical rhythm intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration (RR) in the form of Earned Stasis—peace replacing longing. Cost is legible in the prince’s emotional exhaustion and the palace’s shuddering response, though the “world’s rebirth” feels conceptually grand but physically vague. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the closure image (tears, stillness, pulse of light) reweights earlier motifs effectively. A tighter causal link between egg/device and outcome would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with lyrical layering of motifs (black sand, coin, grafting) building toward a Charged Poise closure: Aria reaffirms her calling amid rain and stars. However, the inciting incident—a radio call—is summarily handled, and the “scene” at the fire-damaged tree lacks causal urgency; the grafting occurs without obstacle or consequence. Cost is conceptual (emotional scars) but never dramatized as a foreclosed path or material loss.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory breadcrumbs and glass shards build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as fountains stir post-liberation. Cost is implied—Aria assumes guardianship—but never rendered as a felt sacrifice on the page; the creak of the box lid substitutes for tangible price. Orientation is clear early, and closure reweights the city’s state, though the “liberated memories” lack specific consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (petals, sonar, gear), and closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the legacy of “gentle touch” reweights cosmic understanding. However, no decisive change or felt cost manifests—“transit” is continuous, not consequential. The final image resonates but lacks legible sacrifice; nothing is foreclosed, only affirmed. Orientation is strong, but escalation is tonal, not structural.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (gravestone carver in greenhouse at dusk), but causality falters: the ghost appears without motivation, triggers no meaningful turn, and vanishes after passive approval. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, yet escalation is static—butterflies arrive, ribbon unfurls, poem recited, insight granted—without narrowing options or imposing cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“shape of collective grief”), but the cost remains conceptualized, not felt or dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost appears on the page. Elara walks until the tower is out of sight—a spatial shift without consequence—and declares peace without foreclosing a path or paying a price. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) collapses because density doesn’t reweight stakes; the ending merely restates the premise. Orientation is clear early, but closure lacks causal or emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure: the final image offers thematic resonance without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes cost undeniable. The chess clock’s stoppage signals time’s passage but doesn’t tighten stakes or foreclose options—pressure remains static, not escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causality: nothing happens except contemplation. There is no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—only circular meditation. The pen never touches the page, rendering the climax an unfulfilled promise. Under any drive lens, this fails closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recurring motifs (dust, radio glow, mist) intensify toward a Conceptual Repricing—dust now tells stories. However, the closure lacks legible cost; Emilia succeeds cleanly, undermining tension. Orientation is clear early (ember alcove, copyist, shortwave), but pressure never tightens into meaningful consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (mask, powder, vanishing). Orientation is clear by line 30: Lena in the gallery before the portrait. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the mirage of safety is reweighted through the dispersal—but the “felt cost” is oblique; no path is foreclosed, only contemplated. The rocking chair opener is evocative but never ties causally to Lena’s action or state.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story lacks causal escalation: nothing changes because of Kael’s actions—no tightening, no deepening, no narrowing of options. The ending offers mood, not closure; there’s no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The chronometer cog appears but never alters knowledge or tactics. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails to intensify or reweight stakes meaningfully by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails the Closure requirement: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page—only cyclical reflection. The ending restates the premise without legible cost or reconfiguration; “traveled stillness” is asserted, not dramatized. No tightening or deepening alters options; the choir rehearsal remains hypothetical, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and mnemonic layering toward a Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse transforms from ruin to crucible. Orientation is strong early (who, where, when anchored by line 3). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sprout reconfigures decay into potential—but cost is implied, not felt; no on-page sacrifice or loss tightens stakes. The celestial alignment functions as catalyst, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is attempted as Conceptual Repricing (“failure… adaptation”), but the cost is abstract and unearned—no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no emotional or social price visible on the page. The riddle (“When shadows dance…”) appears arbitrarily and resolves nothing; it’s decorative, not causal. The blackout backstory is mentioned but exerts zero pressure on present tactics. The story drifts accumulatively without escalation: discovery replaces conflict, revelation substitutes for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: the house as a living entity. However, closure lacks legible cost—Eli is “forever changed” but no opportunity, belief, or relationship is lost or altered on the page. The ritual occurs without resistance, complication, or consequence, flattening escalation. The final image resonates but doesn’t reconfigure stakes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and insight rather than causal pressure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the garden’s decay reframed as adaptive beauty—but the cost is abstract ("welcomed nuance") with no on-page forfeiture or visible price. The ampoule triggers revelation without prior setup, functioning as deus ex machina. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks narrowing of options or tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is functional but pressure lacks causal escalation—stairs “blur” and air “thickens” without narrowing options or altering tactics. The “rupture” is declared, not dramatized as a turn that reconfigures stakes. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (dice as talisman), but cost remains vague (“bound to the staircase”) without on-page consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic density toward a Charged Poise closure: the painter’s renewed commitment amid urban decay. The waxing moon’s arc provides subtle temporal structure, and the final image reconfigures meaning by linking creation to connection. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—no live option is foreclosed, and the “cost” remains abstract (smog recedes but returns; no tangible sacrifice is made). The closure feels resonant but not earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic resonance, but lacks causal linkage: the ice thaws coincidentally, not because of character action or prior setup. Closure takes the form of Conceptual Repricing—the grotto becomes a place of remembrance—but the cost is abstract (“weight of discovery”) rather than felt or visible on the page. The beekeeper reference appears too late to function as a constraint or catalyst, weakening escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the hunger stone’s power activates via an unexplained “surge,” and the yoyo’s “reverse-engineering” occurs off-page as summary, not dramatized action. Closure attempts Charged Poise (“stepped beyond fate’s design”), but the cost is conceptual and vague—no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice is shown. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t taught coherently; symbols and objects accrue without pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks causal linkage: events unfold as a sequence of eerie observations (“I saw X, then Y appeared”) rather than because/therefore progressions. The closure (“everything went black… I felt changed”) offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—it’s summary, not dramatization. Disorientation is not taught early nor paid off; the funhouse remains a static backdrop. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but even by that standard, there’s no pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density toward a Charged Poise closure—the orchard suspended in indigo night, music absorbed into stars. However, the “decisive change” is purely sensory, not consequential: nothing is foreclosed, altered, or paid for. The blue hour deepens, notes fade, and she vanishes—but no option is lost, no path closed. Cost is implied (“residual energy,” “haunting reminder”) but never legible as felt or conceptual price; the ending resonates poetically but lacks the required reconfiguration with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dread builds through repeated motifs (watchers, shells, silence), culminating in Charged Poise—Lyra steps beyond Kyrium, options crystallized but cost only implied. However, the inciting discovery (map in shell) lacks causal linkage to prior action; the crack appears magically upon deciphering, not through earned risk. Orientation is solid early, but closure’s conceptual cost (“sunwashed dread”) remains atmospheric rather than legible as irreversible loss or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: truth reclaimed from noble lies. However, the “decisive change” is purely internal and summary-driven—Emilia “realizes she succeeded,” but nothing concretely shifts in her world or options. Cost is asserted (“truth was finally free”) but never dramatized; ivy relaxing is metaphorical, not felt. Orientation is solid early, but escalation lacks a tightening beat that alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through recurring motifs (inkwell, drawbridge, notes). However, closure lacks a decisive cost: the “interlaced absence” is thematically resonant but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or reconfigured stance with felt consequence. The ending offers Charged Poise, yet the cost remains conceptual, not anchored in a concrete loss or choice. Orientation is clear early, but escalation never tightens options—pressure is static, meditative.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Elara’s “transformation” is asserted, not shown—there’s no foreclosed path, sacrificed option, or tangible consequence for her annotations. The blackout and descent lack causal linkage to her deciphering work, rendering the structure decorative rather than driven. Closure feels like thematic summarization, not earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and emotional density toward a Charged Poise closure: Kaito endures, returning to craft with quiet purpose. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no path is foreclosed, no tangible sacrifice shown. The glass basilica beckons but exerts no causal pressure; dream recording is mentioned but never tested, weakening stake legitimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story adopts a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal gestures) but fails to cohere: the drone strike’s aftermath isn’t causally linked to the observatory’s systems or perturbation theory. Orientation is clear early, but the transition to the Floating Observatory lacks spatial or temporal grounding. Closure attempts Charged Poise (“spirit now tempered… ready”), yet cost remains conceptual—no path is foreclosed, no tangible sacrifice shown. The “shocking revelation” about unused potential reads as thematic assertion, not dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing: the “frequency of belonging” reframed as cosmic connection. However, closure lacks legible cost—the revelation feels weightless, with no foreclosed path or sacrifice. The pilgrim’s arrival establishes setting but exerts no causal pressure; Lena acts in isolation without opposition or meaningful stakes escalation. The chip’s discovery resolves nothing structurally—it merely triggers another data input.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure fails: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page—only a declaration of intent to “continue her search.” The story ends in stasis, not Charged Poise, as no options are foreclosed or reconfigured. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the driftwood carvings don’t intensify pressure—they’re passive props.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: tension builds through recurring motifs (moon phases, mist, drawer pull) and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing where past mistakes are “recycled into wisdom.” However, the closure lacks visible or felt cost—the parties reconcile too smoothly, with no on-page sacrifice or irreversible loss. The parapet setting functions as neutral ground but doesn’t constrain choices causally. Orientation is clear early, but escalation relies on lyrical repetition rather than deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation; events unfold as a series of reflections rather than because/therefore linkages. Jack paddles, feels calm, gains hope—without meaningful resistance, reversal, or narrowing of options. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (broken compass = lesson in letting go), but the cost is abstract (“regrets will always be there”) with no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the rhythmic utility poles never intensify pressure—they merely soothe.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the cryptic message leads directly to the lake, the box appears without resistance, and the baseball instantly “glows with meaning.” No meaningful tightening forecloses options or raises stakes—Lena simply walks deeper as mist clears conveniently. Closure is a Charged Poise (disappearing into labyrinth), but cost is asserted (“weight lifting”) rather than shown. Orientation is sound, but pressure never coheres under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra remains “paradoxically steady” even as she expands. However, causality falters—the ritual works instantly without resistance or cost tied to mechanics, and the “phoenix rises” timeframe exerts no tangible pressure. The closure image resonates but lacks a legible, felt price: Lyra’s metamorphosis feels weightless, not earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (saucer, hand tracings, mist) toward a Conceptual Repricing: lost time accumulates “in the spaces between memories.” This closure lands with conceptual cost—the crack as temporal fracture—but lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options or alters tactics. The memory of tracing hands functions as reflection, not pressure; no beat forces a renunciation or choice that reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the glade’s rules remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of memory, photograph repair, and the Tear’s glow build toward Charged Poise closure—the dimension opens, Aurora becomes one with the ship. However, causality between shadow work and dimensional unlocking remains vague; the climax feels asserted rather than earned through on-page mechanics. Cost is conceptual (legacy, solitude) but lacks a specific, felt sacrifice tied to action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. The “prophecy” resolution relies on coincidence, not causality, and the ending offers thematic assertion (“world transformed”) without a Decisive Change or Charged Poise that forecloses a path. The whispering hush crescendos but never alters Aria’s options—it merely signals revelation. No on-page sentence conveys tangible loss, sacrifice, or irreversible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is Conceptual Repricing (“a new era had begun”), but cost is asserted, not shown—no foreclosed path, no sacrifice. The blackout functions as deus ex machina, not causal pressure; the revolution ignites without resistance or consequence. Orientation is clear early, but causality collapses: the coded sundial message arrives unearned, and the quill holder’s “key” role is retroactively declared. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation relies on summary (“spreading the message… like wildfire”) rather than deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the vision reweights cosmic understanding, with aurora and stardust charging the final image. However, causality falters—the method (painted rocks) lacks setup or mechanics, making the climax feel conjured, not earned. “After friction disappears” is mentioned but never tightens decisions. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t taught until midway.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through storm imagery and recurring motifs. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she achieves peace by confronting hidden truths, with the storm’s dissipation mirroring internal calm. However, cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no opportunity is lost, no path foreclosed. The envelope’s revelation lacks dramatized consequence, softening the closure’s weight despite lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: the “hidden overture” is revealed, and Aurélien revalues victory as journey. However, the duel itself is summarized, not dramatized—climax occurs off-stage in prose (“swords clashing… sparks”), robbing causality of on-page pressure. Cost is asserted (“true victory lay not in winning”) but never felt; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Orientation is strong early, but escalation lacks a decisive tightening that alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the poet decides to rebuild, then simply does so without obstacle, complication, or narrowing of options. Closure is declared (“the library was being reborn”) but offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—only hopeful assertion. The moon’s passage marks time but not meaningful pressure; the ending image of dawn bathes everything in soft light, diffusing stakes rather than crystallizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through recurring motifs (clock, compasses, film) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: the pianist reclaims agency through music, though the cost is emotional rather than material. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“wistful station pianist,” “tidal arbor above the clouds”). However, the transition into the film world lacks causal grounding—it functions as metaphor, not dramatized action—blurring the boundary between psychological escape and literal journey, weakening the legibility of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density toward monsoon arrival. Closure takes the form of Charged Poise: Aria vanishes as the sapling thrives, implying cultural memory is reborn—but cost is implied, not legible on the page (e.g., no sacrifice, loss, or foreclosed path). The Orientation Test passes early; however, escalation lacks a decisive tightening that alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive tightening or deepening that reweights stakes with cost. The compass appears, lace is woven, and the object is released—but these are sequential gestures, not causally linked turns. Closure is attempted via Earned Stasis (release = peace), yet no visible or felt cost anchors the change; regret simply “lifts” without sacrifice. The tides of remembrance concept is invoked but never pressures Kaito’s choices.
