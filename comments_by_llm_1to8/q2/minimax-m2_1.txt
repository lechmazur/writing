    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by opening lines). The closure unit reads as Charged Poise: Mira's shift from victim to pursuer crystallizes in the final image with felt cost (leaving sanctuary, confronting smugglers). However, the causal linkage is thin—frost patterns "reveal" routes but never constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost on the page. The ledger strip survives conveniently and the frost-mirror discovery feels more like thematic decoration than a pressure point that narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost at closure remains more asserted than legible in a specific action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation (who, where, when) anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through mapped spaces, building density toward the performance hall's climactic sensory revelation. However, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration by realization alone—she "understood finally" and "realized now"—without an on-page action, refusal, or forfeiture that forecloses a live path. Cost is asserted ("translate silence into music… succeeded") but not dramatized in a micro-choice or visible trade-off at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-situational hybrid lens: the package arrives → Aldric touches the lens → he is transported → he performs his work → the lens repairs → he returns changed. Orientation anchors (Thursday, Pemberton Street, undertaker) land early. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Aldric's long-chased stillness "finally found him" and he shifts from tired to ready, with the lens now a permanent tool. The cost is visible—he has committed to an impossible vocation—but the ending's "he was ready" declaration feels slightly告知-like rather than fully embodied in a final image or action that makes the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening, satisfying orientation. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (approaching Charged Poise)—the bell-ringing transforms individual survival into collective memory-passing with the final image of Mariem and Farouk embodying intergenerational continuity. However, the cost remains conceptual and somewhat diffuse; no single path is foreclosed with sharp on-page consequence. The accumulation is present but the tightening or deepening feels more asserted ("what they were building tonight would outlast") than dramatized through a micro-choice that visibly alters tactics or forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and metaphoric layering build toward the final photographing act, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (the unused love transforms and flows back into the world). Orientation anchors (camera obscura artist, viaduct, twilight, wisteria) arrive quickly. The closure image is legible and the lens holds, but cost remains conceptual and implied rather than felt—Mei undergoes no visible forfeiture or internal shift that narrows her future options. The breathing-rhythm discovery and the photographing feel like fulfillment of a quest rather than a choice with stakes, lowering the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the halo fragment's properties, the photographs' temporal mutations, and the garden's hyperbolic geometry, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when Elara realizes she must complete the circuit. However, the closure unit—"she began to draw"—lands as intent rather than enacted cost; the price is conceptual and implied but not made undeniable on the page. Escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than narrowing options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece anchors early (carnival, Mira, post-wall freedom) and uses the vault descent as a single meaningful deepening that reweights her mission from reactive survival to active planting strategy. Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: "the illusion of ending" reframes the wall's fall as a beginning, and the cost—waiting through soldiers, smuggling seeds one by one into poisoned earth—is legible on the page. The structure holds as one extended beat without causality breaks, though the turn is conceptual rather than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraphs, with the greenhouse-forge location and timeline ("six months ago," "ten years left") arriving in fragments. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sound-capture as a pattern of absences—yet no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page; the ending gesture ("smiled, just slightly, and returned to her work") reconfigures nothing and carries no felt cost. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and weak closure cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through recurring images (moonbeams, camellias, golden light). However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Mira's options; she waits, observes, photographs, and departs with the same capacity and stance she began with. The man's slight shift in expression offers a micro turn but does not rebound to alter Mira's trajectory or impose visible cost. Closure reads as thematic restatement rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery of thawing, glass-working, and the bookmark across a single continuous scene. Orientation is clear (glassblower, control room, spring thaw) by the opening. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands on the page—the ending restates the thematic premise ("prepared to begin again") without altering options or foreclosing a path. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the closure beat makes a felt or conceptual price legible. Under the selected lens, the final image reiterates rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (waived). Closure unit: Maya's final declaration aims for Charged Poise but lacks visible cost—no on-page action forecloses a path; Daniel's reaction ("his eyes widened") does not constitute a reversal or price paid. The seashell/cast mechanism appears three times but remains ornamental; decryption happens off-page ("pattern emerged from chaos") without showing her outwitting Daniel through tactical application. Inferred lens is Causal but the because/therefore chain breaks: the notes reveal coordinates/dates yet their content never alters her options in scene. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at closure shows a legible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (pebbles, gold leaves, silence, darkness) toward a final cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening sentence (who, where, when). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—the oracle completes her task and finds peace—but the cost is asserted ("her work began") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The final line gestures at continuation without showing what changes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (robot, courtyard, post-Procedure twilight) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative lens is signaled early through looped timelines and recursive memory fragments, and the closure—accepting the flow rather than finding a source—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (foreclosing the search for origin). The piece teaches its pattern of layered iterations and pays it off in the final melody moment. Mild pressure: the Procedure and timeline loops function more as backstory frame than active on-page constraint that narrows a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece builds through layered imagery (crystal surfaces, projector lens, concert tickets, mirrors-within-mirrors) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the form of Charged Poise—the final moment crystallizes the narrator's shift from waiting to active engagement with visible cost (the lens becomes "heavier," a tool for the future, no longer a relic). The cost is felt: the narrator commits to a role that will demand repeated vulnerability. Orientation anchors cleanly by 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira's hand-touch breaks months of isolation, reweighting the dominant stake from abstract hope to embodied connection. The lens holds through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: marbles, polishing ritual, mended deception memory, and the villager's arrival layer meaning. However, no on-page decisive change or choice occurs; the ending recapitulates established stance without reweighting options or extracting felt cost. The mended deception is backstory exposition, not a dramatized event that shifts present tactics. Closure reads as thematic summary rather than a reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Kira adjusts the nexus, achieves temporal readings, and proves her hypothesis in a because/therefore chain. Closure arrives on-page ("time moves sideways") with conceptual repricing—the velith-wings' dual molt phases validate her theory—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt; no prior path is visibly foreclosed, and Kira's professional or emotional standing does not shift. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when), and the single-scene window holds without spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the flood rises, the program reveals notation, Elena plays, and the final image reweights the experience as transmission complete. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the conversation is complete, and Elena leaves with the knowledge received), though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—no tactic was altered by a constraint, no live option was visibly foreclosed. The ellipsis between "lately inspired" and her immediate understanding that Marco left a code skips a causal beat that would strengthen motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira touches the smudge, forgives herself, and issues the warning—foreclosing her paralysis with visible cost (swallowing terror, accepting that errors will recur). The accumulative lens holds throughout: pressure builds through sensory details (aurora, frost patterns, pressure dropping) and the botanical illustration's recurring presence. The drive from fever-break to forecast is motivated by her internal reckoning with Elena's ghost. One small orientation delay: the administration's term "fault tolerance" arrives slightly late but does not obscure the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus moves from skeptical dismissal to speaking his own confession, a stance shift with felt cost (the weight he has carried). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory layering (radio voices, beaded wheel, drowsy alertness) and culminates in a cadence shift when Marcus finally speaks. One meaningful deepening is present; the closure image reweights prior material (the chorus of confessions becomes his own) with legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words without penalty, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither Causal linkage nor Accumulative pattern-break nor Situational crystallization is taught or held through closure. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the ending restates the opening rhythm ("the work continued—quietly, endlessly") without reweighting options or imposing felt cost. Causality is absent; the keeper moves between spaces in a loop with no tightening or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes setting and character early, but operates primarily in accumulative/textural mode without a decisive change or visible cost at closure. Maya's touch is a micro-gesture of connection, yet it doesn't foreclose a path or reconfigure the dominant stake with felt pressure—Elara simply "gathers her things, already planning tomorrow's session." The ending offers thematic resonance but lacks the on-page cost or tightening required for Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image is observational rather than charged with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias reads diaries → discovers Miriam's dragon dreams → comprehends the breach theory → resolves to continue with "renewed urgency." The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: the tapestry warms, and Elias believes "stories enough" might "spin a new axis," reweighting the premise that dreams fueled reality. Cost is conceptual (the world remains displaced) but the final image of warm gold dragons and his commitment to probe deeper reconfigures hope from loss. One meaningful deepening—the shift from passive collection to active hope—lands on the page, satisfying the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: espionage-as-prophecy pattern builds through recurring fortune-writing beats, microdot specs reprise, and the lighthouse beam motif. Orientation anchors promptly (lighthouse, Elias, post-orders). The closure attempts Charged Poise—Elias at the window with arrivals imminent—but the final image diffuses into abstract illumination metaphor without a sharp reweighting of cost or options. The letter-sealing beat offers a micro-turn but the paste-without-reading move feels evasive rather than crystallizing. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost remains conceptual and oblique at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (church, pre-midnight possession attempt, protagonist's method) and maintains coherent accumulative pressure through layered ritual elements. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through loop pedal layers, chant multiplication, and palette focus. However, closure does not land on the page—Matthias walks toward the threshold without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The story stops at preparation rather than delivering an on-page ending beat with visible cost, capping this category.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memory-mapping, image-layering toward a thematic fortune). Orientation anchor appears late: the glass spire, frozen lake, and council summons emerge gradually without clear who/where/when by ~120 words, though disorientation does not later pay off at closure—apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: the final fortune reweights the premise of "unheard music" as already real. However, cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; Elira dissolves into dawn without visible forfeiture, endurance price, or tactical change. The fortune arrives as declaration, not earned pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflective passages and metaphoric images (rain-glow, fractured timelines, stone/water suspension) to deepen the theme of self-integration. Orientation anchors (who: Mira; where: viaduct; when: "between the drop and the ripple") arrive early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of readiness and control, but cost remains asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, loss, or trade-off marks the shift from passive observation to active mastery. The reflective mode exceeds ~50% of the text without interleaved micro-choices that alter present tactics, flattening pressure and making the ending feel like a thematic claim rather than an earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulative lens is signaled early and holds: each backward recording deepens Maren's receptivity until the final image reweights silence as a passage rather than wall. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (her numbness transforms into "a filament of hush [that] sang"), but cost is conceptual and felt rather than a visible forfeiture—the price is implied (permanent deafness accepted) but not dramatized in a concrete choice or refusal. The future-tense coda ("would become") moves off the page and dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal lens holds: being followed → evasion → message arrival → decision to act. The closure—composing and sending counter-evidence—lands on the page with agency, though the cost is more asserted ("something more important than observe") than viscerally felt. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elena connects her weather data to the ministry's crimes, narrowing her options to complicity or exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (drifting poet, grotto, post-arrival world) land early. The piece accumulates layers through the spiral-drawing ritual and builds to a Charged Poise closure where Mira remains on the threshold—options are crystallized and pressure is undeniable. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page; the rope's glow and her renewed pattern-drawing suggest continuity without a legible forfeiture or transformation that alters her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The chronic hush establishes constraint early; Marina's playing accumulates pressure through recursive echoes until the hush "stutters" and is "interrupted." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world begins to breathe again, the bowl carries "a promise kept across generations," and the cost is the acceptance of devastation as inseparable from what remains. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening—music breaking the hush—sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what by first paragraph). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the compound's completion supplies the inciting pressure, the scent triggers immersion, and the final realization about "half truths had always been whole lies" reweights her professional stance. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing with cost implied in "necessary ones, the kind that allowed people to feel what they needed to feel when the raw truth was too much to bear"—she accepts complicity. One tightening (compound test → grief subsumption → acceptance of her method's moral cost) is sufficient at this length, but the cost reads more philosophical than visceral, keeping this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through linked discoveries (program notes → library → envelope → Elias) toward a thematic reconfiguration around invisible labor. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by the second paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the annotated program and reproduced locket photo reweight Maren's understanding of interconnection), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—"cautious exuberance" and planning future reconnections suggest forward momentum rather than a path foreclosed. The causality from concert → library → envelope → office reads as coincidence-driven connection rather than escalating pressure, which is permissible under Situational allowances, but the final image doesn't crystallize options with undeniable felt cost; it opens outward.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (marsh-reeds, glass-powder spirals, obsidian arbor) that converge at closure when Yara realizes the Threader is a practice, not a person, reweighting her search from external validation to reciprocal dedication. The arbor scene crystallizes this shift with visible cost: she must abandon her identity as selfless caretaker and risk asking for help. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the arbor reflection forces her to confront her performative sympathy, narrowing her options to either flee or commit to mutual kinship with visible vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph (Sera, studio, canal city). The journey structure—studio to chamber—provides causal progression, and the closure unit is a Decisive Change (echoes freed, silence ended). However, the cost is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page: we're informed she "remained...until dawn" documenting sounds, but no trade-off, loss, or visible price shapes the final image. The mechanics of "borrowing time from the giant's nap" arrive late and operate more as metaphysical exposition than dramatized constraint, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (glass eyes, mosaic, dovetailing) toward a final image of acceptance, meeting the RR (Earned Stasis) threshold. However, cost remains oblique: what live option does leaving the eyes foreclose? The protagonist walks away "feeling for the first time in three seasons" a shift, but the before/after distinction in stakes or capability is asserted more than dramatized. Orientation is clear early. One tightening occurs when she presses the eyes to her own and sees differently, but the escalation is more conceptual than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens (Maren moves through the building under emergency conditions) and delivers a resonant reconfiguration at closure: she finds a message meant for transmission and recognizes her purpose. However, the Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when anchor past ~120 words with excessive layering ("shadowed library," "pipe chases beneath the stacks," "emergency lights," "sapphire hush," "liminal and holy") that obscures immediate grounding. Cost at closure is conceptual but thin—the "student who has been struggling" resolution occurs off-page and reads as convenience rather than dramatized consequence. The tape fragment discovery lacks prior constraint or tactical friction; it simply appears and Maren immediately understands its purpose without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (linden leaf, storm damage, grant letter) that converge at the trellis to reweight Vera's resistance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the phone call and vine observation crystallize her shift from control to surrender, with visible cost in her admission of needing transformation. One causal beat could be tighter: the grant's arrival feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven, though it deepens rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words and accumulates density through layered world detail (water wars, rain-reading, tidal causeway) toward a closing image of earned rest. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—Mira's choice to sleep after nineteen days—but the cost is felt rather than legible on the page; the text does not show what path she forecloses or what she risks by stopping. The stranger's gift removes friction rather than creating a final trade-off, softening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through sensory density, expanding crystal song, shadow behavior, and distributed cave awareness until the final nine-day deepening reconfigures Varen's relationship to futurity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he remains clairvoyant but has contextualized the gift, a stance shift with visible conceptual cost. The cave's "teaching" and the pilgrim's residual presence add texture without breaking causality. One meaningful tightening occurs when his visions fail at the pearls, narrowing his certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue meaning through staggered visions leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the valve's purpose is understood and the archivist recognizes his ongoing work. Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The closure moment—"he knew his work was only beginning"—reconfigures the archivist's stance from keeper of the past to active compiler of the returning present, but the cost remains abstract and felt rather than concretely dramatized on the page. The understanding itself does not foreclose a path or impose a visible sacrifice; it opens possibility without demonstrated price.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the mist, cracks, and train station accumulate toward the confession moment. Closure attempt: Aria speaks her unspoken truth aloud, a Resonant Reconfiguration (cathartic release). Cost is asserted ("decades of silence," "trembling…quiet into certainty") but not dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift follows the confession. The phantom punch "leaves marks in the air" but this image feels decorative rather than causally integrated. One meaningful deepening is present (mystery → confession), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—Mira's palm-press and the flow of memories crystallize her transformation from observer to participant. Orientation is anchored early (tower, cliff, bay, whale season). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening: transcription → memory revelation → stance shift. Cost is present but somewhat abstract ("taking and giving in equal measure"); a more concrete forfeiture would strengthen the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece anchors who and where by ~120 words (immortal in prismatic escondite). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: intensity builds through storm escalation and amulet warming to a final conceptual realization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"goodbye was not an ending but a doorway"—but the cost remains implicit and philosophical rather than legible in a concrete choice or forfeiture. The solar storm functions as external intensifier without the protagonist making a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ink pot, flowers, and honest-daughter frame recur and deepen toward the final image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elena finds her equation, placing flowers by the ink pot with "something like peace"—reweighting her father's legacy without a decisive external change. Cost is felt (she accepts her role, differentiated from her father) but the final image would strengthen if a specific choice or forfeiture were dramatized rather than summarized. Orientation is clean; the prep-room setting anchors early.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara records a hum-shift, reflects on seven years of silence-mapping, and ends watching fractured light on her notepad. Orientation is established cleanly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). However, no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the final image ("the fluorescent hum continued its song, and Elara listened, as she always had") affirms continuity rather than reconfiguring it. The hum's change is noted but produces no tightening of options, no visible cost, no foreclosed path. Without closure under the chosen lens, the piece cannot enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate toward the label discovery, which reweights the protagonist's understanding of survival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the decision to continue as "something unnamed rather than something erased"), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive late—"nameless one" and "port" are established, but spatial grounding ("towering labyrinth") delays until after the death certificate exposition, creating brief disorientation without ultimate payoff that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: resonant pattern building toward a reconfiguration of Elena's stance. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when established early). The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elena accepts mystery), but cost remains abstract—"professional despair" is named, then softened without visible forfeiture of reputation, method, or a concrete next action. The Russian word "убегая от" (running from) breaks immersion and reads as an artifact. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the final image doesn't reweight prior particulars with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira moves through the carnival painting symbols, building a network through density and pattern. Orientation is clean (Verada, Flotilla District, carnival night). The closure is a Charged Poise moment—"tomorrow, the investors would return" to find "a living network, reorganized and ready"—but the cost remains conceptual and future-tense rather than felt on the page. The stone chip's shift from "relic" to "promise" is asserted in narration, not dramatized through a concrete choice or forfeiture that changes her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pressure builds through density of detail, the ticking chronometer, and the convergence of past (Yusuf's grain) and present (frost vanishing). Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her witness role and the ephemerality of beauty—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a choice that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (depot, morning, Elias at workbench) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the repair accumulates through water-basin diagnostics, deepening our understanding of Elias's method. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the drone's launch proves connection persists "even in a world of machines and distance"—but the cost remains abstract and declared rather than felt. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("It was honest work, and it mattered") tells rather than charges the image, weakening the reconfiguration's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers clues (falcon, leaf, symbol, phrasebook) toward a final moment of interpretive confidence. Orientation anchors are present early (frozen lake, outpost, Miriam's role). The closure unit reads as Charged Poise—Miriam holds proof and feels discovery imminent—but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The final image reweights prior material but does not show a decisive change or visible sacrifice, only readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Eliorn's repeated walking circuits are meant to deepen pressure toward a tipping point. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the cobblestones hum in response, and she states "two thousand footsteps left" before full revival. The cost is conceptual (time, effort, solitary endurance) but legible in "legs ached" and "three seasons" of solitary labor. One structural weakness: the ending recounts the hum rather than dramatizing a decisive tightening choice or reversal that forecloses a path; the "perhaps two thousand footsteps left" undercuts finality and makes the closure feel provisional rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marina becomes the living repository, forecloses her singular existence) with conceptual cost legible in "not as herself but as something greater." Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the perfume unlocks layered memories, density increases, and the final image reweights her sacrifice as "lonesome and splendid." One meaningful deepening occurs when she opens the vial and accepts transformation. The causality of the mechanism (perfume as key, hidden gears, temple's recognition) holds, though the leap from "drawing water into her lungs" to transcendent breathing skips embodied struggle and risks convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who and where within the first paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout the lighthouse ascent. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: copperlight repose and lattice imagery build density toward the final spoken testimony. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marcus kneels and speaks the truth, crystallizing his stance as "the second cry wolf"—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; the bodies "would be found soon" places consequence off-page. One meaningful deepening occurs (entering the chamber, speaking aloud), sufficient for this length, yet the felt price at the closure beat is implied rather than visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmospheric density and teaches a pattern of spectral visitation across centuries, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara solidifies, the gardener receives the blessing/curse, and dawn stars "recognize their old positions." Cost is conceptual and felt—Elara's near-completion of penance, the gardener's new burden—legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gardener witnesses the scions' transformation and receives the "loving venom," reweighting Elara's stake from solitary penance to generational handoff. The closure reconfigures the endless-night premise into approaching dawn with visible cost (the gardener must now carry the work).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (red canyon, needle, thread, illustration plate, spring) toward a final densification. Orientation anchors (Maren, canyon, evening ritual) land early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the spring bordered with light, transforming loss into reverence), and cost is implied through years of wandering and nightly processions. However, the cost at the closure beat itself is conceptual rather than felt on the page—Maren completes her work without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovering the paths glow, then reaching the spring), sufficient for this length, but the ending summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing a final choice with tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear linkage: Mira's discovery of the birthmark-matched sundial motivates her week-long excavation, which culminates in her decision to restore the site and become its witness. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she resets the sundial under moonlight, ending her interrupted journey and beginning another, with the cost legible in her acceptance of a custodial role that foreclosed her previous academic distance. One escalation point (the birthmark discovery) tightens options meaningfully. The piece teaches its lens early and holds it through closure, though the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("a homecoming that was also a departure") slightly dilutes the concrete charge of the sundial-placement image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images of codes, arcade ambiance, and the pseudonym-crafting ritual build toward the postscript addition and Maren's departure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. However, closure lacks decisive change or visible cost—Maren adds a postscript and prepares to mail the letter, but no prior constraint is visibly overcome or path foreclosed. The ending reconfigures nothing; it restates her ritual without reweighting stakes or charging prior material with new pressure. Resonant Reconfiguration is not achieved because no felt price lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through embroidered conspiracy records; the "eternal candle" and galaxy charts recur). The story lacks a decisive on-page change; Elara begins listening and ends listening with no reversal, renunciation, or reweighted stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise attempt—she sees the coup's shape and "threads that could unravel it"—but cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture, no tactical narrowing on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Escalation is accumulative (adding detail to the conspiracy map) but the final image does not crystallize a new limit or price that the prior beats imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Maren, medium), where (mangrove swamp), and when (present return after 17 years) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the singing spirits, the window message, the gargoyle's glow, culminating in the self-forgiveness and dual-self holding at dawn—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the window's second message shifts from command to absolution. Deduction: the causality of how the gargoyle "awakens" and enables the moonlight healing feels slightly convenient rather than fully motivated by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered translation and the coral-fragment motif, closing on a resonant image (Elira pressing the cast, feeling shared grief). Cost is implied—she will return the cast, relinquishing witness—but the price lacks sharp on-page consequence; no option narrows, no tactic shifts. The atrium-to-bedside transition is legible, the anesthetic frame holds, and the closure image reweights prior material, satisfying RR (Charged Poise). One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered images (fog, fresco, light) and pays off when the dancer "lifts off the wall" and the district "remembers." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's uncurling chest and the district's remembered joy crystallize options with felt cost (the fragment darkens, giving everything). Orientation is prompt: "In the orchard district...Mira walked." One tightening suffices at this length. The cost is legible in "the fresco fragment was darker than before, as if it had given everything it had left to give."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately within the first third. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elena accepts the garden's mystery rather than controlling restoration), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift demonstrates what she has surrendered. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (sound layering, nested awakenings motif), which the ending honors, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (nickel discovery shifts her relationship to the work), meeting the minimum for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story offers atmosphere and world-building but no on-page closure with felt cost. Maren begins intending to plant the seed and ends having planted it; the drone passes without consequence, leaving the action's stakes theoretical. The "first root reaching downward" is metaphorical promise rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights what came before. The piece reads as a setup awaiting its inciting incident rather than a complete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors early (garrett, shell, poet who cannot sleep) and accumulates density through layered metaphors that reweight longing and creative endurance. The closure image—"poems becoming tendrils, becoming roots, becoming the blossom armistice...proof that beauty can grow from even the longest wait"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the continuing act itself is crystallized as meaning. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action forecloses a path or changes tactics. The "shyly unstoppable" quality and the trembling postcard gesture toward transformation but do not deliver a felt before/after with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the piece never establishes a present stake or pressure that tightens. The caretaker begins her nightly rounds, completes them, and returns the wind chime—no reversal, escalation, or foreclosed path. The final paragraph ("she had already begun preparing for the work ahead") explicitly telegraphs stasis without cost. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early and follows a clear causal arc: Elara translates the final passage, which leads to Elian's arrival and their reconciliation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (restored trust, Charged Poise at "a place before paths diverge"), and the cost is legible in the three-year silence and Elara's sustained effort. However, the final paragraph's "cautious exuberance" and "place before paths diverge" language drifts into abstraction, softening the closure image's punch. The inferred lens is Causal, and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara arrives, samples adhesive, realizes her father's message, commits to his work. Orientation anchors (amphitheater, volcano, surveyor's chain) appear early. However, the closure—rising with "dappled resolve" to continue engineering—lacks a decisive on-page cost or visible foreclosure; she simply inherits the mission without dramatized renunciation or trade-off. The final image reweights prior material thematically but does not crystallize a before/after with undeniable pressure or felt price. Causality is present but the RR/CR effect at closure is asserted more than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Eleanor, attic, present-day restoration work) arrive within the first paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with sustained density across autumn weeks. The closure unit—Eleanor playing the reconstructed recording and choosing to "remain open to messages"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she commits to trust as daily practice). However, the cost is asserted in abstract terms ("willingness to send another message") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page, weakening the felt weight at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reunion framed as threshold-crossing with conceptual cost), but the cost remains abstract—"necessary distance" is declared sacred without dramatizing what Elara surrenders or risks on the page. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (grain-reading, weather codes, spiral logic) but the final image ("every boundary was also a doorway") moralizes rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure. Causality is present but loose: the terrace "drifts" toward the village by atmospheric currents with no prior setup of this mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (feather, fireflies, bioluminescence, amber specimen) that converge at the ending to reweight the belonging question. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the final firefly ascent and Marek's kinship realization reframe the archive's loneliness into shared wonder. Orientation anchors early (Marek, underwater facility, burnt feather). The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt: the facility will flood by morning, but Marek's own sacrifice or forfeiture is not dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places the feather beside the amber and the objects pulse in resonance, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is anchored quickly (geode, recollectionist practice, dusk arrival). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Maren traces emotional residue through conjecture, building density until the final reweighting ("Some paths don't disappear...They just lead somewhere unexpected"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the fisher's grief shifts from loss to continuation—with felt cost (he weeps, but gains "another form of peace"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren finds the gaps and pushes past them to deliver her interpretation, altering the fisher's emotional stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (arcade, nighttime performer, liminal timeframe). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern, atmosphere, and cadence build toward a conceptual statement about art and control. However, no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost occurs—the ending returns Marek to his starting stance ("already calculating tomorrow's performance") without tightening, deepening, or reweighting options. The piece cycles rather than closes, offering thematic echo but no legible before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tide dancer's realization that "exile is not a leaving but a arriving"). Orientation is delayed—we don't know who, where, or the concrete situation until deep into paragraph one; the nostalgia ban and exile remain abstract. The closure image offers conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than shown: she feels "lighter" and smiles rather than experiencing visible forfeiture. The verse-writing beat unfolds without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors early (glazier, harbor, pre-dawn) and maintains coherent accumulative structure. However, closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration without legible cost: the protagonist returns to her workshop carrying "the pond's lesson," but no option is foreclosed, no renunciation occurs, and the "before everything shifts" frame promises change that never materializes on the page. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image restates the opening meditation rather than reweighting it with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory, reflection, and sensory detail to reweight Mira's relationship with loss by the ending. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's final decision to return to the station and carry her experience forward is signaled as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the ongoing vigil, the acceptance of her altered self). However, the cost is felt more than dramatized; the piece tells us she has "learned to carry what Elena could not" without a discrete on-page moment where that capacity is tested or priced this night, which keeps it shy of high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure unit exists: Elara begins her research and ends preparing for another session with identical confidence, producing neither Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, nor Conceptual Repricing. The narrative is purely expository summary across an unspecified duration ("days," "years," "late afternoon") without a single causal beat or tightening that narrows options. The stated stakes—understanding hope across parallel timelines—remain abstract declarations never tested by dramatized events. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (grotto location unclear until paragraph 13) but the effect does not serve closure, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira moves through the ruined university, layering discoveries (ivy, diaries, negative strip, Ashworth's echo chart) toward a final image that reweights her isolation into continuity. Orientation anchors quickly (corridor echo cartographer, flooded university, three years post-grandmother's death). The closure—Mira begins sketching, no longer alone in her work—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her legacy burden with felt companionship across time. Cost is conceptual and emotional (accepting the burden as continuation) but could be sharper on the page; the final beat tells us she "did not feel alone" rather than showing a decisive forfeit or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by line 3 (waived). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—atmospheric density building toward a final reconfiguration. However, closure lacks visible cost: Aria completes her ritual exactly as planned, leaves unchanged, and promises to repeat tomorrow. No path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no felt price paid. The ending offers thematic assertion ("mirrors...never quite looked at the world the same way again") without on-page evidence that stakes have shifted or that Aria's stance has been tested. A Conceptual Repricing requires undeniable cost in the final image; here the cost is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual of reading names, the midsummer setting, and the handshake accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the closure unit lacks visible cost on the page—Maren "understands" redemption in "endless, gentle muster," but no on-page action or image crystallizes what she has renounced or what specific path is now foreclosed. The orientation is clean early, and causality holds through the gathering, but the final moment asserts transformation ("she had found her own redemption") without dramatizing the price or the before/after legibility required for closure. Applying the Cost proof test: no exact sentence at the ending beat makes cost unmistakable, triggering −0.6 in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates as a single sustained beat of ritual execution rather than a causally linked sequence; the protagonist arrives with a completed plan and enacts it. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the egg left alone on the salt flat crystallizes the central question of preservation versus futility—but the cost remains abstract (years of sacrifice summarized) rather than dramatized in the final image. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The lens holds, but the lack of on-page tightening or reversal that changes her options keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is, where precisely, and what immediate danger she faces remain vague past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, but closure lacks decisive cost—she departs "awake" and "defiant," states she already held at the opening, so no path is visibly foreclosed. The "harvest of echoes" work is metaphorical throughout; no concrete before/after in her options or knowledge lands on the page. Cause-effect linkage is minimal: kneeling, perceiving threads, and rising do not narrow choices or alter stakes in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Elias, radar dome, post-argument night). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: reverse-telling deepens understanding through cadence shift and the final planted stick offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—he leaves the stick, refusing completion). Cost is conceptual and felt: he abandons his colonial completion instinct. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the closure effect is legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through dense imagery and pattern-building that culminates in the monarch's rest—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara's patient work achieves temporary success with the awareness that impermanence is the cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The wind-interruption provides a tightening that forces improvisation, and the seventeen-minute rest delivers a crystallized moment where the cost (transience, the knowledge "might not exist next year") charges the closure image. The closure lands cleanly under the Accumulative lens with felt cost, though the escalation itself is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (sanctum, Yara, keeper of names), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the night as the rope begins to glow and hum with retained memory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Yara creates "space for what remained" and rises to walk toward the door; the cost is visible in aching joints and five winters of isolation, the rope now a living archive. One tightening suffices at this length. Small penalty: the final paragraph moralizes slightly ("not a monument to the past but a living archive") where image alone would have charged harder.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows "Foresight," "bunker," and "wafer seal" but lacks a clear present goal or immediate pressure beyond vague decay. The closure—"Then she transcended"—is asserted rather than shown with on-page cost; no before/after alteration in options or knowledge is legible. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is signaled through dream-vision recursion but never crystallizes into a decisive reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with felt consequence. Causality is intact but stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Maruk's archive discovery motivates the ritual, which renews the covenant and ensures the new regime's favor. Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace, regime transition) arrive promptly. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant renewed, the palace at peace), but the cost remains abstract—Maruk "said nothing" and keeps the secret, yet no tactical option is visibly foreclosed and no price paid beyond continued silence. The "unexpected favor" for the new rulers is told outcome rather than dramatized consequence, weakening the felt weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure—pin reappearing when grace settles—lands on the page with a clear before/after, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we see no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (reality-shifting imagery accumulates until the final settling), held consistently. Orientation is delayed: "where light bent at impossible angles" establishes place only atmospherically; who Mira is and what she's doing remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The "grace" mechanism is explained late rather than demonstrated through prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with its emphasis on fog, boundaries, and the gradual assembly of the mirror, holding that lens through closure. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words, though the atmospheric cohesion partially mitigates confusion. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror capturing the glass mountains), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no clear before/after in Mira's options or stance is legible on the page. The narrative relies heavily on thematic assertion ("erasing boundaries") rather than dramatized pressure that forces a choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The closure—Mira crossing to her daughter with evidence of repair—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the reunion is imminent, options crystallized). Cost is legible: months of stubborn persistence, the visible brokenness she carries. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard imagery, the ribbon, the quartz eye accrue weight and shift meaning at the end. One persistent constraint (the shattered eye, the breached contract) shapes tactics throughout. The daughter's arrival at the exact moment of repair strains causality slightly but does not break the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (asteroid orchard/bathroom), and the inheritance stake early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and reflection build density toward a final resonant moment when the cameo reveals its image. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mira asks the question and receives the answer without forfeiting an option or facing a trade-off on the page; "finally...about to inherit" and "understanding" are declared, not demonstrated through a choice that narrows her world. The cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what she loses or risks by asking. Backstory occupies ~35% but remains anchored to the cameo and question, satisfying BRR's reflection-led exception, so no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors appear early, but the story remains in summary-dominant mode throughout—Elara moves through chambers, discovers notes, realizes purposes, all recounted rather than dramatized in continuous present pressure. The closure unit (her understanding that rescue means confronting fear of knowledge) reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page. Drive lens infers Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the final paragraph restates theme without a decisive image that reweights prior material. Apply Cost Proof Test: I cannot point to an exact sentence where the cost of her stance is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fog lifts, memories clarify, card intensifies—a pattern of deepening rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors (Mira, prow, carnival ship, fog) arrive early. Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira steps forward, "both trapped...and impossibly free," crystallizing her stance toward her brother's absence. Cost is felt but oblique—she accepts the search will continue without resolution, which reweights the opening obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes clear orientation (clock tower, Elena, night) and follows a causal chain: seal discovery → rope examination → door materialization. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elena succeeds without friction, loss, or foreclosed paths. The "soft sigh" and materialization read as convenient vindication rather than a choice with stakes. Under a Causal lens, the resolution feels granted rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, deepest cavern, months after arrival). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory detail, crack-pattern reading, and stone warmth until the spiral formation crystallizes the bloom of hush. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid)—Mira rests within the silence she found, forecloses the path of constant noise, and promises to return tomorrow with others. Cost is felt (months of chaos, survivors hiding, her own accumulated noise) and the final image reweights the echo chamber stone's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing attempt at closure: the final image aims to reweight the pavilion's hum and Elara's custodianship as meaningful rather than futile. Orientation is established (who, where, post-collapse timeframe) within the opening, though the spatial relationship between pavilion and tower wavers. The piece lacks a decisive reversal or tightening; discovery of the prism is passive (half-buried debris) rather than earned by agency, and the climb is announced but not executed on the page, leaving closure as intention rather than accomplished reconfiguration. Cost remains conceptual and asserted ("thistle-blown hope") rather than dramatized through forfeited option or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist walks the forecourt, observes monuments, and reflects on collective memory in a single continuous meditation. No causal reversal or tightening narrows options; the storm intensifies and quiets without altering her stance or knowledge. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing—"not their names, but their love; not their achievements, but their presence"—that reweights the premise, but the cost remains implied rather than concretely legible on the page, and no prior constraint shaped her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean—who, where, and when anchor by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira gathers details (fortress, mosaic note, ritual preparation), and the final spiral of fire reweights the opening emptiness with a reversal ("deciding to wake up"). The closure lands on the page with a visible cost (she commits to the ritual, voices respond) and the lens holds. Mild deduction: the mosaic note feels convenient—it declares the premise rather than emerging from prior causality—and the "atmospheric disturbance" remains abstract, lowering the stakes' tangibility.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (tide, transition, grotto, cicada) that converge at closure. Orientation is established early (grotto, sisters, pause in conversation). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's gesture and the sister's softened reply signal a shift in their relational state. The cost is felt but oblique: the three-year silence and the effort required to stay present. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira places the cicada as offering, reweighting the conversation from stalemate to tentative return.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Mira encounters an impossible garden during a gravity inversion and collects a resonance that reframes her bunker imprisonment. Orientation anchors who and where by ~150 words (late but functional), and the gravity countdown provides a ticking constraint. However, the closure—Mira deciding to carry the "gilded hush" and someday build a trellis—lands as declared intention rather than on-page change with visible cost; the doll "pulsing" and "approving" substitutes felt consequence with metaphor. The cost (returning to the bunker tonight but changed internally) is implied but not legible in a specific forfeiture or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (operator, vessel, boy) arrive early. The piece accumulates images (storm glass, prism light, silence) toward a resonant final state, but the closure lacks felt cost—the boy's breathing steadies, the glass clears, and Maren smiles with satisfaction rather than forfeiting anything or facing a trade-off. The transformation happens *to* the boy via Maren's expertise, not through a protagonist choice that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (silence learns to comfort) but the conceptual cost is not legible; success arrives without price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images (waterfall colors, paint layers, crystalline spirals) build toward the stairway's materialization. Orientation anchors arrive late (midnight sally, orchard, pavilion sequence) but are eventually legible. The closure—Elara ascending as sunrise breaks—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("surrender a certainty") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or visible price alters her stance. The window-closing urgency is mentioned then immediately dismissed ("she did not rush"), flattening the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives quickly (sanctuary, charred timber, doorknocker ring). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: motifs recur (threshold, suffocation, bridges) and density increases toward the ending image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she steps through carrying the ring into starlight—but the cost is abstract ("suffocating breath of a world") rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or alteration of tactics. The gasping figure teaching her the lesson feels expository rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates glitchy texts, grandmother's bolt, mushroom-farm wonder, and parallel-Maya encounter toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "promises could become something true"). Cost is implied rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift ties the bolt's glow to a price Maya pays. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately; the closure image reweights her premise, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes clear causal progression through discovery beats (gate → house → reading room → gramophone), but the piece ends mid-revelation without delivering a closure unit. The text breaks off at "a choice that had echoe[d]" before any Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing can land with felt cost. Orientation is clean and the Accumulative lens builds well through the first 90%, but the absent ending makes cost illegible. Apply −1.5 for the missing closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a conceptual shift), but the closure unit—Aldric's vow completing itself and his internal transformation—lacks visible cost on the page; the greenhouse "fading" is atmospheric rather than a felt price he pays. Causality is present but loose: the marionettes' power is asserted rather than discovered through dramatized resistance or trade-off. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives cleanly within the first paragraphs, waiving that penalty, but the ending reconfigures meaning without legible consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers detail and reflection to reweigh the button's significance. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). However, closure lacks a decisive on-page change or a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Mara begins documenting "with a reverence that bordered on prayer," but this is the same posture she held at the start; no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. The ending image deepens thematic weight but does not impose felt cost or alter her situation. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes a price legible in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is adequate by the second paragraph (who, where, when), though "tonight" arrives late. The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative layering (unraveling plan → escape → discovery → descent), but the closure unit is weak: Mira finds the archive and plans distribution, yet no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page. The final image—descending with a teaching promise—gestures toward future action rather than paying off present pressure with felt cost. The piece teaches a resistance premise but does not reweight it through a crystallized choice or visible forfeiture at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: the saxophonist performs his inherited duty against the prophecy's pressure, and closure arrives as Earned Stasis—he has "bought them another day" and will return at dawn, foreclosing escape with visible cost (eerie nostalgia, ragged breath, the weight of duty). Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the first two paragraphs. The escalation is modest—one phrase breaks through, he answers, the prophecy falls silent—but the final image reweights the stakes with felt cost, and the lens holds. The closure qualifies as RR (Earned Stasis) because the refusal to let the prophecy speak is a stance that forecloses other paths with on-page exhaustion and inherited burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece signals Causal lens early (leaf carries prophecy → Seraphina decodes → finds seed), but the closure lacks visible cost: she retrieves the forgotten seed and "knows" she'll be different by morning without on-page consequence or forfeited option. The Hush frame and "transformation" are asserted rather than enacted. Orientation is delayed—arbor location and Seraphina's role take ~180 words to anchor, earning a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The seed vault discovery reads as convenient fulfillment rather than a turn that narrows her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Maren), what (search for compass), and where (greenhouse/stairwell) within the opening third. The piece ends mid-descent with no on-page closure—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The stairwell discovery and descent constitute setup without a closure unit that reweights options or meaning with felt cost. Drive lens reads as Causal (following letter clue → finding entrance → descending), but the story stops before the lens can complete its work at a closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (Maren, foundry, post-funeral). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: grief → understanding through the physical act of repair → resonant reconfiguration at closure. The kintsugi restoration provides a meaningful deepening that reweights her relationship to her brother's legacy, and the final image (coin with golden seams, rain resuming) carries visible cost—she accepts damage as part of legacy. One issue: the phrase "after the search party disbands" in the opening is grammatically incomplete and slightly obscures temporal grounding, though context recovers it.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ritual detail and spectral encounter, aiming for a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (who/where/when by ~80 words). However, the closure lacks on-page cost—the soldier disperses "in something that looked almost like gratitude" and Mira simply continues her work. The ending recycles the opening's action ("adjusted the harp...began to play again") without reweighting options or imposing a felt price. The piece demonstrates competent linkage but the closure effect remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph (Mira awakening post-interrogation in an ultraviolet forest). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (pewter strap humming, ultraviolet gathering like water) and the mathematics-of-mercy motif reweights from survival calculation to acceptance of devastation. Closure achieves Charged Poise—Mira stops at the clearing's edge understanding she must trade "the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger," crystallizing her stance with undeniable conceptual cost even though the final transaction remains unexecuted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece accumulates understanding through the market encounter, painting revelation, and alchemist's explanation, culminating in the protagonist's realization that they are becoming a bridge. Orientation is clear by the market description (~15% mark). The closure—"I was being prepared to become one"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (forfeiting mere preservation for active transmission), though the felt price could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lens fragment's true nature as relay is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Marcus reaches for the hatch with the mainspring humming, crystallizing his dual role (repair/medium) and the story unwinds into its next phase with visible commitment. The causal lens holds—lights fail, dust analysis leads to the barrel, presence guides him to the hatch—with one meaningful tightening when the echo "pressed closer" and transmitted urgency. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is felt as Marcus accepts the inevitability of engagement ("he always did") and physically commits by climbing, foreclosing the option to walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered imagery (frost → bottle → press → expansion) toward a final cadence shift when the whisper is released. Orientation anchors arrive late: "who" is named line one, but "glass orchard library" and the post-Negotiation timeframe emerge slowly across the first third without clear spatial grounding until the frost scene. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the whisper's release reweights the Library's systems and Elara's stance ("some eternities needed to be opened"), but the cost remains conceptual—no on-page forfeiture or tactical alteration is legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bottle is placed under the press, but causality between frost-reading and bottle-discovery feels elliptical rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Vespera in Archive Hall during visible-time era). The accumulative lens is taught early—visible time pooling, sediment imagery—and held through closure. Storm arrival tightens pressure; Vespera's glimpse of the founders as desperate refugees delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the archaeological dispute with undeniable cost (official histories versus lived truth). The closure lands with felt consequence: her choice to cover the final mirror while imagining a civilization "learning to see itself clearly" forecloses the single-story demand of her failed revolution. Cost is legible in the renunciation of certainty and the acceptance of multiplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Who/where/when anchor by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: forty years of patient work, particles of light collected across decades, culminating in a single tethering act that births one note. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the first note rises, not a full restoration, and the moment reweights the entire patient covenant. Cost is implied through "not fully reclaimed—perhaps it never could be" and the persistence of his work, but the conceptual cost lacks sharp on-page specificity; the story gestures toward incompleteness rather than dramatizing a visible forfeiture or consequence that alters Cassian's next move.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's arrival at the lagoon forecloses all prior collection work with the cost explicitly named ("she would not return"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via petrichor → compass → psychometry → descent → lagoon, each beat reweighting her central stake. Orientation is anchored early (factory, ridge, her profession). The piece teaches its pattern by the compass arrival and maintains coherence through to the final image of stillness and irreversible presence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered imagery (driftwood, archway, lantern slide) and shifts cadence at the storm shelter, then again at the studio. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final sculptural gesture crystallizes her place in the generational chain with felt cost (solitude, devotion). The GPS failure anchors "after" cleanly by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide reveals its secret, reweighting her artistic practice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Mira, pavilion, autumn, then winter transition), and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through its layered imagery and seasonal progression. The closure—Mira's realization and shift from "decorative commission into something true and essential"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing), reweighting her artistic purpose. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("quiet courage of blooming unseen") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture on the page; we don't see what she gives up or what constraint now binds her new work. The discovery of the cathedral window's hidden layers provides the turn, but the mechanics of *how* she overlooked it for months and *why* this particular morning reveals it feel convenient rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers memory, encoded messages, and setting toward a final encounter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the grandmother's message delivered), but the cost remains abstract—"someone who would remember"—without on-page forfeiture or altered options. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The sequence progresses through discovery → transit → arrival → revelation, but the final beat feels delivered rather than crystallized through protagonist choice, limiting closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: memory accumulates density until the cove reconceives itself. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elias walks forward "knowing" rather than forfeiting or enduring. The reconception is spectacle, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The lens holds, but the ending offers Charged Poise at best, and the cost remains conceptual without a legible on-page moment where options narrow or a path forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles fragments (foghorn silence, grandmother's recording, ancient oath tablets, dead languages) toward a final reweighting when Seraphine "hears" the accumulated promises. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her archive's new meaning—silence filled with the dead's kept word—with undeniable conceptual pressure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (rooftop garden, 43 stories, post-foghorn silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the wax shaving triggers full immersion and the covenant becomes audible. Cost is more conceptual than visceral: the story asserts emotional patterns "settled into her archive's deepest vault," but the price Seraphine pays—what she forfeits or how her options narrow—remains oblique rather than on-page concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through preparation beats that deepen ritual significance toward a final moment of vortex sealing. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding achieved, vortex sealed), yet the cost remains abstract—what did she forfeit or foreclose? The "texture of borrowed time" revelation feels conceptual rather than felt, and the seedling's response doesn't clearly demonstrate what changed in tactical terms or what path was closed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through atmospheric detail and micro-climate tracking toward the moment of siren activation. Closure operates as Charged Poise—the test completes, the storm arrives, "zero hour, precisely as predicted"—but the cost remains conceptual (alignment within a system) rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The drive holds without contradiction, but the final image reweights prior material more through symmetry than through a decisive tightening or visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The piece moves through observation → kneeling → collection without a causal turn or meaningful tightening; the janitor's stance at the end is identical to the opening. No closure unit is legible—no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, no Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The ending summarizes a philosophy already stated in paragraph three, offering no before/after or felt price. Under an Accumulative lens the piece needed a pattern break or cadence shift to reweight the dominant stake; none occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is solid: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph. The ghost's appearance and gesture toward the buried box create a linear causal path to the stained glass discovery and covenant transfer, satisfying the Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts the keeper role, but the cost—her ongoing solitude, the "crushing weight"—is asserted more than dramatized; the final image tells us she holds "unspoken words" rather than showing a forfeited path or immediate consequence. One meaningful tightening (ghost appearance → excavation → covenant transfer) is sufficient for this length, but the cost legibility at closure is borderline.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge slowly through ~180 words of abstract meditation before "emerald silo" anchors locale, triggering a −0.3 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the cremation urn fragment seed returns in the final paragraph with thematic reweighting (pause/texture of time), achieving a Conceptual Repricing. However, cost remains conceptual and oblique—no foreclosed path or visible trade-off on the page weakens closure legibility under the CR standard.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric method. The piece teaches its pattern early—fragments washing ashore, the poet gathering and tending—and the closure operates as Conceptual Repricing: "woven dawns" and the kite-without-string reconfigure incompleteness from deficit to generative possibility. The cost is conceptual and undeniable in the final image (the fire "needed no fuel but its own incompleteness to keep burning"), though it remains oblique rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the kingfisher returns and examines the feather, then flies despite injury, allowing the poet to understand that the gesture matters more than achievement. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (shoreline, lagoon, post-storm morning, poet kneeling).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who, where, terminal frame). The piece accumulates density through copper wire, pillars, and botanical diary motifs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts her death as "redistributing energy back into the cycle," foreclosing panic or regret with conceptual cost felt in "She would not live to see the full flowering." However, the closure reweights meaning primarily through reflection rather than a decisive image or action that crystallizes pressure. Cost is more contemplative than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.7)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. Elena climbs, reflects, descends—no decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material occurs on the page. The orientation test is satisfied early (tower, spring morning, Elena), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal pressure nor accumulative density creates a meaningful tightening or deepening by the end. The final paragraph asserts transformation and understanding but does not dramatize a moment where options narrow or a price is paid. Without closure, Q2 cannot enter the mid-bands.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coachman's ritual deposits accumulate symbolic weight and the green thread at the end offers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the bleached reef with restoration. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the timeframe ("after the reef died") is clear. However, the cost at closure is implied rather than visceral—no forfeited alternative, no visible sacrifice, only the "smile of those who have delivered their final passenger." The single meaningful tightening (kneeling, planting, waiting, green thread) is sufficient for this length, but the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases from scrapyard → cylinder construction → tactile decoding, culminating in the brother's message and dual-object closure image. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph crystallizes the narrator's stance—waiting, translating distance—but the cost is asserted ("distance into closeness") rather than legible as forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The cylinder's reveal does not narrow options or foreclose a live path; it confirms hope already held. One meaningful deepening (shift from scent-search to tactile reading) is present, meeting the textural lens threshold, but the cost-proof test fails—no exact sentence shows what the narrator sacrifices or loses in accepting this state.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through reflection, pattern, and the final sketching act. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance without fear), but cost remains conceptual and asserted ("blessing and burden merged") rather than legible in a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. Orientation anchors late (~paragraph 2) but remains functional. The shutdown provides backstory pressure but no on-page tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and follows a causal track: theft → guilt → restitution attempt. However, the closure unit—"the weight lifted from his shoulders as he stepped into the unknown"—offers a Decisive Change that is asserted rather than earned; no on-page cost is legible in the final beat. The "Wait—I have miscounted" interlude disrupts momentum without taught pattern or payoff, reading as a false start rather than purposeful compression. The inferred lens is Causal, but the ending does not narrow options or change knowledge with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the walking-archive conceit and maintains it to closure. Orientation anchors (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) arrive within the first paragraph. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira walks "beginning" and releases her sister's name, a shift from holding to letting go—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited action or choice. The interregnum framing and acoustic-space logic cohere without contradiction, earning mid-7s, but the final image's cost is felt more than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the seer decides to leave, carrying the stone. The closure reconfigures her relationship to her gift with conceptual cost (ending isolation, accepting vulnerability). However, orientation is delayed—"after remembering became painful" and "the cavernous bookstore" establish when and where only vaguely, and "mercury-glass seer" as identity arrives without spatial or temporal anchor by ~120 words. The "seven nights... eighth night" structure provides a tightening, but the accumulative pressure relies heavily on reflection rather than scene-based constraint. Cost is implied (leaving sanctuary, carrying the stone into an uncertain world) but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira completes the tapestry work and achieves self-forgiveness, walking with "fierce repose." Orientation is clean early (frozen village, thunder lull, chess tutor). The story accumulates symbolic weight (tapestry border, platinum labyrinth, frozen villagers resuming motion) and the final image reweights her exile as permission. Cost is felt but oblique—she carries the folded tapestry and the quiet mind, yet no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page; the cost reads more as conceptual release than renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the border and reinterprets her failure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric prose, thematic recursion) and builds density through the poetry-spreading action. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Sera stands surrounded by children, the truth "refracted into a hundred small voices," with the ritual unable to dissolve what's already distributed. The cost is legible—she's exposed to the priests, her sanctuary dissolved—but the final image asserts freedom without showing the priests' response or Sera's next constraint, which weakens the felt cost. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the children multiply her verses.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational pressure (workshop flooding, three breaths left) and executes a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the alchemist reframes her impending death as understanding rather than failure, with the acid sea's retreat marking the conceptual shift. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The midpoint causality is thin; the statue-matching ritual proceeds without escalation until the final breath delivers the realization. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout, with the closure landing through cadence shift and conceptual repricing rather than plot reversal. Cost is felt but oblique—the renunciation of certainty as illumination—legible enough under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: Marcus wanders, discovers the hidden chamber, encounters the shell, and the pool's reflection reweights his understanding of permanence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he releases the shell and accepts that beauty cannot be possessed. Cost is visible in the three-year silence and the act of letting go. The wrong turn → hidden oasis → grandmother's shell sequence reads as motivated coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, consistent with Situational tolerance, and the final image ("the keeping was in the releasing") recharges the opening grief with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, dawn, post-heat-wave). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the heat breaks, the garden blooms, Mira studies the logs, uncorks the vial, and sends her intention—building density toward a final image where "whispers were right." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the first ship turns, sailors speak in hushed voices, and the logbook entry reweights the premise with felt cost (Mira's solitary vigil and renunciation of recognition). One meaningful deepening is present. Cost is legible in the final image, though the turn itself is quiet and relies on accumulation rather than a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by the cupola view; the dominant stake (guide the bereft through grief geography) emerges early and tightens when the woman's voice breaks through static asking Mara to walk north. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara descends, meets the woman, and commits to the work again—"neither an ending nor a beginning, but a way through"—with the cost made legible in her willingness to traverse the marsh repeatedly. One substantive tightening (the midnight call → descent → marsh meeting) is sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens; the final image reweights the premise without forced reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with heavy reflection about the past virus and the orchard's symbolic persistence. Orientation is delayed—who Mira is and what she's doing now emerge gradually through backstory rather than concrete anchors. The closure is a quiet settling into study with symbolic resonance ("some things persisted"), which reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The ~50% reflection flattens present-tense pressure despite the BRR exception allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure unit lands: Aldric recognizes the boutonnière as his mother's gesture and decides to write to the address, a Decisive Change that forecloses his prior isolation. However, the boutonnière's hidden note appears conveniently late without prior setup, and the causal chain relies on retrospective explanation rather than dramatized discovery. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse keeper, dock, twilight). The lens reads Causal but the key turn is told via memory rather than present-scene pressure, limiting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative lens: map clues → ants → cavern → doorway builds through discovered pattern rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors (Maren, her shop, three weeks post-funeral) land early. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren steps through as water rises, crystallizing her lifelong search with undeniable pressure. The cost—leaving the known world, potential drowning—is felt in the urgent water and "held its breath" final image, though the conceptual price (what she forfeits by stepping through) remains slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the first paragraph; the climb itself provides causal linkage through because/therefore steps (warning → climb → grotto → understanding). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reborn purpose) with felt cost implied through "disenchantment momentarily forgotten" and the smile after three years, signaling a shift in stance. However, the cost is asserted rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page, and the final understanding arrives as declaration ("she understood") rather than through a dramatized choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed; we lack clear spatial grounding and relationship context until well past the 120-word threshold (−0.4). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the "final principle" epiphany, but the cost is purely conceptual and not dramatized—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The piece operates in Accumulative mode but never tightens or deepens with a felt pressure point; it loops through variations of the same thesis. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and purely thematic meditation, never crystallizing into coherent escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening scroll image and grave meditation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recursive time loops, motif layering (grave, scroll, soaring), and a cadence shift at closure ("This is my grave, learning to speak"). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final triple anaphora reweights the chronicle/chaos premise—but cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible before/after in options or relational state anchors the reconfiguration on the page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies for unclear anchors past ~120 words without taught disorientation that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elena, shop, morning fog, "Thirty-seven days ago"). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena's attention reframes her loss as a shift in sensing mode rather than pure deficit, with the cost legible in the forfeited profession and sensory world. The screw motif seeds early, returns at closure ("still warm in her hand"), and reweights the premise. Pressure accumulates through layered reflections rather than plot reversals, consistent with the chosen lens. One persistent weakness: the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("she understood now") slightly undermines the image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (floating platform, between storms, rune inscription task) and operates under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands: Elara moves from forcing textbook symbols to writing "what her heart had always known," and the runes hold—a meaningful shift with felt cost (shedding cynicism, accepting a hidden affliction). One meaningful deepening occurs when she stops trying to force the symbols and lets memory guide her hand. The closure unit is legible and the cost—emotional acceptance of the crystallizing and of her grandmother's wisdom—is present, though the exact on-page sentence proving cost is somewhat diffuse across the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly; the induced-current window creates a ticking clock that tightens pressure. The apology delivered and the current fading constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the connection flickers out "too late to matter and just in time to begin again," reweighting the prior estrangement with felt cost. Causal lens holds: Eleanor's arrival, the archive setup, and the miracle's time limit link cleanly, though Margot's response remains somewhat passive, reducing the final turn's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~120 words; no penalty. The piece teaches a lyric/accumulative pattern but delivers no closure unit—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final paragraph repeats earlier description without narrowing options, changing knowledge, or reweighting the premise. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence makes a price legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The piece accumulates density through water-clock imagery and the seventeen-year cycle, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final beat where Aira understands "clocks measured change itself" and commits to another seventeen years—a form of Earned Stasis with felt cost (solitude, devotion). The cost is legible in "the only shepherd left" and her smile of contentment despite isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ephemeral nature of time becomes concrete understanding, reweighting her devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to a conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (library, midsummer, Elara, post-heart-attack). The closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing when Elara reframes the scrawls and offers the lantern as honest light, reweighting her father's gambling through the lens of "invitations." Cost is felt but somewhat diffuse—the "clover melancholy" and "addition of losses that might yet become multiplication of meaning" gesture toward emotional stakes without a sharp, irreversible forfeiture. The linkage is more thematic than causal, fitting the accumulative mode, but the final image could land with greater specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Mira, utility corridor, phone operator role). The piece accumulates density through layered reflection on her eleven-year practice, the harmonica disc, and the loop of wrong-number calls, but no on-page event narrows options or reweights the stake with felt cost—the final line sets up a call but does not deliver a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. Closure remains promissory rather than executed; the story stops at threshold without crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered reflection and sensory accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the archivist accepts preservation as breathing rather than freezing, extending the covenant forward. Orientation anchors cleanly (archivist, jetty, twilight, locket). One meaningful deepening occurs when she examines the photo closely and finds it "only grew richer, more layered, more true," reweighting her fear of proximity. Cost is conceptual (accepting temporality, releasing "impossible expectations") but felt in the final shawl image of "haunted euphoria." The accumulative pattern holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the logistician agrees to stay until midnight, foreclosing their pattern of flight with a visible promise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the chain of intermediaries, the station as liminal space, and the reciprocity rule, culminating in a cadence shift when the protagonist finally asks for what they need. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the trade rule is explained and immediately applied, narrowing options. The cost is legible: staying, being found, and the rumor spreading constitute a foreclosed escape route.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint—is signaled early, and the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the forest walk deepens sensory pattern until the stillpoint crystallizes meaning. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost; Elara's "new kind of map" and the assertion "she would never be lost again" feel like declarative epiphanies rather than choices that foreclose a path or impose felt consequence. The phrase "she had always been exactly where she needed to be" deflates tension retroactively, suggesting no genuine risk or sacrifice attended the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure effect reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's acceptance that "every wrong turn was a form of filtering" reweights her career reassignment and the gravitational anomaly's role, charging the final image of her sitting with the universe. Cost is conceptual and felt—she's foreclosed the path of immediate verification, choosing solitary recognition over career vindication. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes the signal as a response, shifting her understanding of the anomaly from distortion to refinement. The accumulative design (reflective blocks, signal work, epiphany) coheres, though the middle stretch leans heavily on exposition rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding silence-as-language), but the cost remains abstract—Marina was already signing grief, and the story doesn't establish what she could do before versus after. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (grief + moonlight + grandmother's absence building toward the signing moment), but the final image "began—finally, fully—to translate" announces arrival without dramatizing the before/after stakes or what translation now means differently. Orientation is prompt (harbor, interpreter, grandmother's death) by the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece violates orientation anchors: the opening library fire is summary; the Archive appears without clear spatial or temporal grounding past the 120-word threshold. Drive lens is ambiguous—causal linkage is weak (grandmother's fragment → Archive discovery is told, not shown), and accumulative patterning is not taught early. Closure is told ("she carried not just the knowledge...a promise fulfilled") rather than shown as a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. Cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price of the three-year stay or emergence legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through setting detail and reflection, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation anchors arrive early (who/where/treatment context). However, closure cost is oblique—the drumming "feeds the dream" and the lagoon pulses, but no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a live path with felt consequence. The scientists' future wondering is told rather than dramatized, softening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (port, storm, radio failure). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "something had shifted in the hierarchy of knowledge" crystallizes the reweighting of old networks over technology with felt social cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Reyes's challenge becomes vindication. Cost is conceptual and relational—his admission "carried the particular weight of a man who had been wrong"—legible but somewhat muted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a single continuous scene at the dock with clear spatial anchors (cobalt dock, canal, warehouse shutters) and accumulates pressure through the guardian's patterned light-work and the boy's gradual noticing. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the boy looks at her, "really look," and they sit in "stillwater tension…filled with stars that had learned to wait"—reconfiguring options without a decisive act. The cost is conceptual (the boy's half-spoken secret meeting its limit) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's attention shifts from internal despair to external pattern, reweighting his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and what are anchored early, but when ("three winters ago," "first night of each month," "between one starlit evening and the next") remains vague and does not tighten decisions, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of quiet rebellion via window displays, no causal linkage between beats), but the closure offers only summary ("something was growing") rather than a decisive image or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost. The final paragraph describes effects without a crystallized moment where Eleanor's stance or the town's options visibly reconfigure; closure form (RR or CR) is not legible on the page, only narrated in abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale's call accumulates pressure through sensory layering and the scrimshaw's symbolic weight deepens across beats. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (heart opening, stepping into water, leaving the scrimshaw behind) with felt cost—she forecloses her guarded life. Orientation anchors quickly (harbor, docks, twilight, Maren alone). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the scrimshaw's true purpose and acts on it. The cost is legible in the final image: she swims toward unknown transformation, the scrimshaw left behind as a deliberate severance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure form: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image crystallizes her stance—blank face now defiant, not merely professional—and reconfigures the opening's tension between surveillance and survival with felt cost (permanent emotional void, isolation). Orientation is clean by ~80 words (farmhouse, morning after drone, whittling). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through layered imagery (turbines, flowers, narration) and the cadence shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake (preserving interiority under mandate). One micro turn when she compares the wooden rose to the dried bouquet, then moves to the window for the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, cloud-shadow poet). The piece attempts closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet crosses what was forbidden and gains "settled knowledge"), but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page—no visible price, forfeiture, or tactical constraint appears in the final image. The "dissolution" operates as metaphor without dramatized consequence, weakening the closure effect under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, and when all anchored). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (glass, plant arrangements, the reed tongue) build density toward the final moment where the apprentice kneels to learn. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the apprentice's new understanding crystallizes options without a decisive physical act, and the cost is conceptual (the passing of the reed tongue reweights Mira's solitary practice into shared language). One meaningful deepening occurs when the apprentice deciphers her plant language and she responds by gifting the reed. However, the conceptual cost at closure is oblique; the final image of the apprentice kneeling "to learn" reconfigures meaning but the felt price—what Mira or the apprentice forfeits—remains implied rather than dramatized in a single legible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers Elara's design work, her understanding of pilgrimage, and the carbide lens as anchor across multiple weeks. Orientation is clear (laboratory, post-collapse, Elara alone). The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—"all journeys were in some sense artificial"—but the cost remains abstract and philosophical rather than dramatized on the page. The final night's realization does not narrow options or alter tactics; it summarizes what the piece has been exploring. No meaningful tightening occurs; the accumulation remains even and reflective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—starlight, curtains, origami coordinates build a pattern of guidance-through-grief. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, "tonight") land early. The closure image ("stepped through toward whatever came next") offers Charged Poise but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactic change marks the threshold. The because/therefore chain from origami → new arrival → pendant → stepping through reads more as inevitable procession than a narrowing choice that closes a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through the card spread, measuring-tape gesture, and confession, building to Soren's physical act of rolling the tape and his "hope" as he departs—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize and tension eases with felt cost (his acknowledgment of complicity). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cards reveal systemic failure and Soren speaks his confession aloud, shifting his stance from reverse-engineering analyst to someone who can "finally see them all." Cost is visible in his breaking voice and the renunciation implicit in his thanks.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the "steadily unpredictable" dance builds density through layered reflection and the pagoda's prismatic response, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the historian understands purification as release rather than possession. Cost is implied in the phrase "burden and blessing" but the final image does not make a specific forfeiture legible on the page—what exactly does she lose or give up by stepping into the embrace? The closure unit reconfigures meaning but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph (blooming library, Mira, after the Unbinding). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through layered reflections and recurring images (river stone, mother's dissolution, blossoms) rather than because/therefore turns. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of Mira continuing her vigil, but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) does not apply here; anchors arrive early enough. The accumulative design is taught, but the final cadence shift does not reweight the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece runs on an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist → work → thinning → clarity forms a cadence arc that reweights Mara's relationship to broken things and truth. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she chooses to stand quietly in wreckage rather than rebuild certainty, and the cost is legible—she will never recover the "blinding trust of before." Orientation anchors (greenhouse, workbench, three days post-collapse) land early. The tail-tip restoration provides sufficient tightening (incomplete repair mirrors her own state) and the stars' indifferent beauty charges the final image without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture with causal progression) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's realization that her scars are "evidence of love." Orientation anchors (tower, dawn, post-surgery) arrive promptly. The coffee rings provide a meaningful tightening that reframes the grandmother's role and charges the tunnel descent. However, the closure's conceptual cost feels asserted rather than felt—Maya's grief simply reframes without a visible forfeiture or tactical shift that narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional residue pools, visions layer, and the final act of returning the canister reweights "unused love" from mystery to witnessed stasis. However, closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) without a legible cost to Mira—she descends with "particular peace," but no option has been foreclosed or paid for on her end. The sisters' story carries emotional weight, yet Mira's role as passive witness keeps the ending from landing with felt consequence for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is prompt: aurora-lit archway, astrolabe, Seraphine. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure meant to accrue through imagery and reflection toward a moment of release. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stasis broken by stillness leading to creative flow), but cost remains abstract: we are told stardust "poured forth," not shown what she does differently or what path is now foreclosed. The "or perhaps forever" hedging and looping reflections dilute causal momentum. One meaningful deepening (stillness replaces struggle) is present, but the final beat lacks a legible on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered images (glowing moss, divergent archive, frozen clock) that converge at the merchant encounter, where Mira's declaration reweights the opening premise. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her refusal and reply crystallize her stance with conceptual cost ("Hope looks like a pause"). Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, what). The merchant's appearance and disappearance feel slightly convenient but serve the pattern. Cost is felt rather than physical, which fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: brass gears accumulate meaning, the jungle externalizes consciousness, the tangle unravels into a doorway. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when Cyrus places the gear and the tangle unravels, but the causal link is metaphorical—no prior on-page action explains why this gesture works now. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): "the straying had ended" because understanding shifts rather than a decisive physical change. Cost is conceptual ("no back to return to") but the final image does not show what he loses or forecloses by stepping through; the cost remains asserted rather than felt. The lens holds, but the deepening lacks causal grounding in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woman takes the first step onto the middle path with earned passage, reweighting her vigil as reclamation rather than surrender. Cost is felt through the rusty-key metaphor and the forfeited leash, though the final image's warmth ("gently, persistently reclaimed") softens the price. The accumulative lens holds—density increases through looped imagery (leash, shoreline, twilight) that narrows to a single forward step. Orientation anchors clearly: old woman, water's edge, twilight, then guides and ridgeway.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure) and lands a clear before/after: Marcus moves from paralysis to recognition that safety itself was complicit. Orientation anchors (bellhop, fortress, winter, nerve regeneration) arrive within the first 120 words. The bolt discovery and bronze trail provide a meaningful tightening that narrows his interpretive frame, and the final image reweights "unpardonable silence" with conceptual cost—though the cost remains more intellectual than visceral, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: "who" and "where" arrive early, but "when" remains vague ("across the pause of shifting constellations" is atmospheric, not an anchor); no −0.3 applied since the lyric frame is taught. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural is inferred (density build toward a final image). Closure problem: the ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—Threnody simply "returned to her endless work" with no visible cost, no tightening of options, no reweighting of the dominant stake. The "young scholar being born" is future-tense setup, not an on-page closure effect. No felt or conceptual cost is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing): the ecosystem paths "had not simply disappeared. They had transformed." Cost is conceptual—acceptance that maps are "photographs of temporary truths"—and felt in her shift from automatic measurement to invented communication. Orientation is clear by paragraph one (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through interleaved reflection, then the buoy data reweights the dominant stake (whether paths can regenerate). One meaningful deepening occurs when the unexpected coral formation changes her understanding, and the final tapping signals her altered stance. Causality is clean within the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone circle's hum intensifies through repeated contact, Kira's stance crystallizes, and the final image reweights the rebellion from violent uprising to "remembrance." Orientation anchors (spaceport repair bay, twilight, Kira alone with opera glasses) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Kira's resolve to reignite the rebellion "not with violence but with remembrance" reconfigures the dominant stake. Cost is implied rather than visceral—no specific path is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid on the page—which keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear by ~180 words (greenhouse, post-eruption reconstruction, Yara and Anya present). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempted at closure. However, the ending delivers theme statement ("the courage to evolve what they had been given") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The decision to unseal is affirmed by warmth from the embryo—external validation rather than protagonist choice under pressure—weakening closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear early (lighthouse property, three years post-wedding, greenhouse work). The accumulative lens is taught and held: daily rituals deepen, trauma responses persist, small victories accumulate toward the cereus moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "Not escape, not forgetting, but a place" with visible cost (crumpled photograph never smoothed, years of chosen isolation, grief that "arrived like weather"). The four-year nursing of the night-blooming cereus directly enables the final realization and forecloses the path of seeking conventional healing, meeting the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The lighthouse anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph (waiving Orientation penalty). Pressure builds through the cards' dispersal, the thread-untangling action, and the descent into the chamber; the final image (complete box, perception redesigned) reconfigures Mira's artist identity with felt cost—she forfeits the portraitist's need for single truths. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the images were not broken—they were waiting to be seen differently," which narrows her options toward acceptance. Cost is legible in the line "rethreading her perception until fragmentation became gift rather than curse," though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (albino tracker, wind-carved encampment, post-eclipse) arrive early enough. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of ink, time distortion, and the tracker's perception layer toward dissolution. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the tracker becomes part of the mystery he sought, his body fading into "ephemeral patterns"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt on the page. The before/after is legible (investigator → investigated phenomenon), yet no tactical choice or visible sacrifice shapes the transformation; he simply touches ink and dissolves. One meaningful deepening occurs when ink begins to glow and time thins, but the tracker's agency in that moment is unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Orientation is clean (archivist, cryogenic library, eleven years, tonight). The inciting incident (letter arrives) triggers a because/therefore sequence: discovery → contemplation → transmission. However, the escalation is thin—no on-page obstacle complicates the choice, and the "dormant networks" conveniently enable the climax without prior constraint. Closure occurs on the page (transmission initiated), but the cost remains abstract ("everything changed") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The causality holds but lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights "peace" from absence-of-violence to active nurturing. However, the entire narrative unfolds in retrospective summary mode—"three seasons past," "those early months"—with no present-scene pressure. The orientation test waived (dome setting clear early), but the lack of a present tense crisis means the closure lands as theme statement rather than dramatized cost. The before/after is conceptual but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with layered imagery (sound waves, constellations, echo) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Morwen becomes vessel for the goddess's song with visible cost (he now carries this burden). Orientation anchors appear early (fisher, storm, garden, rocky coast). The escalation reads as density increase and pattern convergence rather than causal turns, fitting the chosen lens. Cost is present but somewhat abstract: "a weight lifted, a connection made" tells more than it shows, and the final image of "fishing for echoes" reconfigures his identity but the felt price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal. The piece offers clear motivation (journalist's accusation) → analysis (proof by contradiction) → decision (descend to find evidence), with causality intact. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Eleanor crystallizes her stance and the stakes are reconfigured (she will break the cycle), but the cost remains prospective—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image. The "inevitability of gravity" line gestures toward cost but doesn't land a felt consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the contradiction revealing hidden sabotage), sufficient for this length under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (letters → laboratory → amber → translation → coordinates → chamber) but the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Mira "begins to work" with "trembling hands" yet no decision, renunciation, or visible consequence materializes. The orientation debt is severe—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words ("space between seconds," "laboratory of lost sounds") without concrete anchoring, and this disorientation never pays off at closure. The final image gestures toward action ("mapping the stars of redemption") but offers only metaphor, not a legible change in options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (Elara, grotto, unlearning period). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory listening, alignment of spirals with stains, the tile's resonance, and the interjection that creates emergent hush—a clear pattern break that reweights the dominant stake (discovering meaning). The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara rises with permission to let drawings die, a stance crystallization with felt cost (abandoning her attachment to permanence). One ambiguity: the "unlearning" frame is atmosphere-rich but causally thin; it hovers as backdrop rather than tightening options on the page, which keeps this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph and sustains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the tessera's discovery, Soren's arrival, and the climactic renaming. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the sacred renaming reconfigures "aberrant mercy" from preservation of ruins into preservation through transformation—with the conceptual cost legible in Lysara's acceptance that she cannot save the dead, only gift the living with indestructible empathy. One meaningful deepening (the moment she lifts the stone and reads its shifted patterns) tightens the stakes and narrows her path to action. The "bell began to ring" and "shaft of light" ending images charge the final beat without summarizing it away, though the prose drifts toward elevated declaration ("the warmth of it was like holding an ember") where a sharper particular would have landed harder.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered echoes, synesthetic texture). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Elara, emporium, courtyard). The closure unit—Mira touching the coin and "choosing to believe again"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("her timeline rejoined the fractured whole") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or shift in tactics. The "weight of the coin lift[ing]" from Elara's palm suggests release, yet no prior scene established what she risked or lost by holding it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation arrives promptly (studio, Mira, post-shock). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira's realization crystallizes a gentler method and charges the final image ("willowglass hope")—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or foreclosed option anchors the before/after. The static shock → geode pulse → somatic recognition → epiphany chain reads more as unveiling than escalation; Mira never narrows options or pays a price to access this insight. The ending reconfigures her stance yet the reconfiguration feels granted rather than wrestled from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and reflective density toward a final realization, but the closure unit—Maren's decision to "map not just the sensory landscape but the emotional geography"—lacks visible or felt cost on the page. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. However, the ending articulates purpose without demonstrating a trade-off, foreclosed path, or dramatized price; the algae "pulsing brighter" and the fossil "watching" are decorative rather than causal or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the button catalog accretes meaning until the jar discovery shifts her understanding. However, the closure lands as a thematic assertion ("wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied") rather than a visible cost or stance that forecloses a path. The High Seers' arrival is summarized off-page, and Elara returns to cataloging unchanged, offering Charged Poise at best but with cost implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric inflections; the piece anchors who/where/when early (Elena, Zephyr Bluff, spring threshold). The closure—Elena extending the pillbox to the ally—functions as Charged Poise: options crystallize and the cost (trust, exposure) is felt even if not yet paid. One tightening occurs when the second spy arrives and Elena must choose whether to hand over the evidence. The "salvation mechanism" setup and snow-code beat link causally to the final gesture, though the middle relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the fog-bound wait, the yarn needle's layered meaning, and the barge's arrival build density toward a closure image. However, the ending offers reconfiguration without legible cost—the coachman steps onto the barge with acceptance, but no option has been foreclosed on the page, no choice visibly narrows tactics. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the closure unit lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mira, oasis, three-day journey) arrive cleanly within the first third. The piece accumulates density through layered imagery (clay, beekeepers, timelines, lantern thrum) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mira internalizes the oasis's "stubborn green" as a carried frequency. Cost is conceptual and felt—she understands gentleness as sharp, persistent—but the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("would take… would set… would let") operates in future intention rather than on-page action, softening immediacy. One meaningful deepening is present; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (rosebush, gauge tooth, harbor, oars) toward a final planting ritual. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Maren, fire escape, third floor, moonlit harbor). However, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via teaching ritual rather than a Decisive Change, and the cost—what Maren or the girl forfeits or risks—remains abstract ("dark corners where your heart feels empty"). The final beat ("something was already stirring") asserts hope without dramatizing a visible price paid on the page. Linkage coheres under the chosen lens, but felt cost at closure is elusive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals its accumulative/textural lens early (tidal library, brass sundial, reincarnation memories) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's realization that "extinction was not an ending but a transformation." Orientation is present by the opening paragraph (who, where, timeframe). However, the closure relies heavily on assertion ("The book was not a record of what had been lost but a map of what might yet be born") rather than a dramatized encounter or choice that makes the cost visible. The final image of wading toward the eastern stacks carries charged poise, but the conceptual repricing is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, lotus temple, post-storm). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the nest discovery deepens reflection, which crystallizes into the installation idea. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final understanding reweights her work's meaning, and the cost is opportunity (years of anonymous labor now claimed). The lens holds, though the ending leans heavily on articulated epiphany rather than image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with moderate linkage: tricksters broadcast subsonic waves → Maya decodes the pattern → she engineers counter-frequencies → tensions ease. Closure arrives on-page (she disrupts the manipulation and "had won this round"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, relationship sacrifice, or tactical price paid in the ending image. The orientation is prompt (university radio station, protests bleeding through walls) and causality holds, but the decisive change lacks felt weight because Maya's victory is narrated as complete rather than charged with lingering threat or personal toll.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, stakes). The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: Elara's choices narrow her path (enter tunnel → follow compass → take key), and the organ music functions as both obstacle and guide. Closure lands on-page with the key retrieval and her reframed relationship to the tunnels, though the cost—her grandfather's death and her own terror—feels more inherited than paid in present action. One clear tightening when the organ transfixes her, then she breaks through to act.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered detail (ribbon fragment, quarry, grief sediment) toward a final image meant to reweight the stakes. Orientation anchors arrive by the end of the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—Elena completes the portrait and will send it, but no option is foreclosed, no price paid, and no before/after legible beyond task completion. The final image ("lance through the fog") reprises earlier diction but does not reconfigure meaning or impose felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Maren gains archive access → decodes journals → discovers erasure → decides to act. Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (map librarian, climate institute basement, seventeen years). The closure unit is Charged Poise: Maren rises with intent to publish, options crystallized (expose truth vs. perpetuate silence), and the cost is felt (institutional retaliation, continuation of exile). However, the tightening occurs entirely off-page—senior researchers "exchange glances," journals "yield," predictions "validate"—so causality is recounted rather than dramatized. The Cost Proof Test shows conceptual price (career risk, institutional shame) but no on-page sentence makes that cost visceral at the ending beat; the wind "screaming" charges atmosphere but does not reweight her internal calculus in a new way.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the glass-flake reveal and the final shimmer, reweighting the hitchhiker's disappearance as intentional passage rather than loss. Orientation is delayed: the hitchhiker's entry "three hours earlier" and the tunnel vanishing are both retrospective summaries, forcing the reader to reconstruct causality after the fact (−0.4). The closure image—shimmer in the rearview, decision to recount—lands with conceptual cost (the fiddler's life mission is now bound to an unexplainable event), but the physical price remains abstract. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: meaning accretes through layered images (bridge-song, glass flake, scaffold netting) that converge at the pullout to reweight "vanishing" as "threshold."

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece offers orientation (Marcus at the circus clearing) and establishes a dominant stake (whether to accept the acquisition). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus and Elena decide to dissolve and restart—but the cost is largely asserted ("we choose whether we're running toward or running from") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (the circus-train metaphor accumulates meaning), yet the final decision feels like a summary of intent rather than a crystallized moment with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition across journals, dreams, and stellar data—but the closure lands as a summary realization ("she finally understood") rather than a decisive image or reconfiguration with felt cost. The piece narrates understanding rather than dramatizing a choice or renunciation that forecloses an option. Cost is asserted ("shared burdens," "healing words") but not made legible in a concrete action or forfeiture at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Kaelen's past failure creates the frozen dome, which he methodically dissolves through expanding circles, then plants the seed to complete the transformation. Orientation anchors (druid, vortex, cursed lake, ice dome) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure—watching the green shoot emerge and accepting his failure as lesson—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost: his reputation remains damaged). Cost is legible in "He had not saved his reputation" and the acceptance that marks him. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ice shatters and he completes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph; "root-bound visionary," "cobalt glade," "violet earth" establish frame quickly. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layers of mythic backstory and imagery build toward the final planting act. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "her consciousness spilling out through the maze topiary clipping...becoming the bridge she had always been meant to be." Cost is conceptual and felt (expansion beyond rooted self, transformation of identity) but remains slightly abstracted; the final image charges prior material but doesn't fully foreclose options with sharp before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through densely layered imagery (roots, bones, apples, card) that reweights the dominant stake of grief-trading. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara recognizes that honoring holes rather than patching them makes her "more whole"—with the conceptual cost legible in "burned-out spaces where joy used to live." One meaningful deepening occurs when the card falls and the sister "becomes part of the orchard," shifting the premise from resurrection to transference with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: television failure → isolation in quarry → message about amplifier → decision to confront past. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two without delay. The closure is a Charged Poise—Marcus's on-off-on phone gesture crystallizes his internal shift from insulation to willingness, reconfiguring his stance toward purpose with the cost felt (he must face Elko and the amplifier's history). One meaningful tightening occurs when the collector's message reintroduces The Rusty Kings' history, narrowing Marcus's options to either remain or confront. The cost is primarily emotional anticipation rather than a visible forfeiture on the page, which prevents entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (who, where, when). The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered reflection on cuneiform's evolution, the tree's suspension, and Elara's shifting ambitions, culminating in the seed's unfolding as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is conceptual and felt—her ambition "reestablished in a form she could finally sustain"—but the final image's pressure relies on assertion ("the transition itself felt like coming home") rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture or decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece orients who (Asa), where (tidal atrium), and what (preserving migrating identities) within the opening paragraphs. However, no on-page closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—is legible. The ending repeats the opening's premise ("here, you may rest") without narrowing options, paying a cost, or reweighting the stakes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reconfigures meaning; the narrative simply circles back to its beginning with identical serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: bunker inspection → discovery → pool encounter → confession reading → pearl retrieval → commitment to send shells. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Margret's act of lifting the pearl and deciding to send the shells crystallizes her shift from measuring walls to enabling connection, with visible cost (she will file the report, seal the facility, work around bureaucracy). The lens holds; the final image reweights the opening thesis. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reads the confession and "something crack[s] in her chest," narrowing her stance and forcing the retrieval choice. Minor slips: the pearl "acquiring abandoned hopes" and glowing brighter reads slightly convenient, but the pattern coheres under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who, where, when). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the graffiti discoveries accumulate pressure and reweight the protagonist's self-blame, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—she accepts flooding without apology). Cost is visible: she forgoes the absolution she "imagined would come like a sudden clearing of sky" and instead accepts "quieter" solace. One meaningful deepening occurs when the graffiti shifts her understanding. Deduction: the pivot feels slightly tell-heavy ("She understood now...") rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "the library where she now stood" (paragraph 3) introduces a second library without clear transition from the marble-step library in paragraph 1, violating spatial coherence (−0.4). The cipher "unfolds" only as atmospheric claim; no on-page mechanism changes her options or knowledge. Closure offers no decisive change—she finds the door and receives the second letter, but no choice, renunciation, or reweighting with visible cost occurs. The ending asserts "the answer revealed through the journey itself" without showing what changed or what it cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: coffee-stain visions, wisteria memory, and perforated-destiny motif accumulate toward the bow-lift. Closure registers as Charged Poise—the final note crystallizes her choice—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely legible (no visible price paid or option foreclosed on the page). The lens holds, escalation is present as density increase, but cost proof is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmospheric density toward a lyric closure), but the piece lacks a clear before/after. Mira arrives intending to capture the spark and does so without complication; no reversal, deepening, or tightening narrows her options. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but closure lacks visible cost—the emerald simply "holds" the spark as planned. The threshold imagery recurs without reweighting stakes or forcing a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece opens with clear anchors (grotto, Elara, hairpin) and accumulates through reflection on forgiveness → searching → climbing → epiphany. The CR ("contentment was not a destination...the cycle itself") reweights the premise, but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no concrete path is foreclosed on the page, only an understanding shifts. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and holds it, but the final beat lacks the felt or visible price that would elevate closure from insight to sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors are present (lighthouse keeper finds Mara at dawn, post-campfire). The accumulative lens is suggested by the reflective mode and recurring objects, but the closure unit lacks decisive change—Mara ends where she began, ready to greet tomorrow's client with the same tools and stance. The text offers a conceptual repricing when she sees her own "certain" compass in the mirror, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: no tactic shifts, no option narrows. The ending reads as thesis restatement rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the ring sequence, each bringing layered memory and understanding, culminating in Mina's mirrored action that reweights the opening stance. Orientation anchors promptly (floating rock, sycamores, pond) and the closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mina's stone-throw forecloses passive reception and crystallizes her path forward with conceptual cost (a lifetime of learning). The escalation reads as density increase across four rings, each reweighting the dominant stake (learning to vanish/appear). One minor seam: "magnetic grotto beneath the stars" is named but never spatially grounded or used to constrain choice, creating slight disorientation about whether it's metaphor or literal location.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust layers, bird patterns, and the wandering pulse build density toward a final cadence shift. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The ending offers thematic reflection ("true navigation was not about the movement of the body") but does not reweight prior particulars with felt or conceptual cost; it summarizes rather than enacts closure. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat makes a price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden exists "nowhere on any map," keystone completes the folly), reweighting Mira's role from underachiever to finder. Orientation anchors clearly: icebound spire, fifteen years, ward calibration. The mist-walking beat deepens rather than reverses, and the final image—keystone slotting into the waiting space—lands with conceptual cost (she leaves the spire, abandons automation duty). One micro turn (wards flicker, mist begins) suffices at this length under accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly in paragraph one (pier lamplighter, sky lantern ceremony, harbor). The piece accumulates pressure through lyric density and motif recurrence (light, promise, color of sound) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias receives the vision and understands his father's vow by "becoming quiet enough." Visible cost is present but muted—three years of cold waiting and the worn key tag signal endurance, yet the final image leans heavily on epiphany without a foreclosed path or decisive trade-off legible in the ending beat. One meaningful deepening occurs (meteor flash catalyzes the synesthetic vision), meeting the length requirement, but the cost feels more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds density through layered description and reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kira recognizes her purpose as witness). However, the closure lacks visible cost—the realization is a confirmation rather than a foreclosure. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when established early), but the "backwards prophecy" concept remains abstract and doesn't constrain tactics on the page. The meaningful tightening is weak; the static bursts and coin-casting feel ornamental rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (recordings, atlas, scattered light) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Melencolia names her grief and the monsters, crystallizing sorrow into portable form. Closure occurs on the page with felt cost (the hollow refilled "with something that was not quite a heart but was enough"). Orientation anchors early (observatory, dusk, reaper). One meaningful deepening through the act of naming reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (lukewarm mage, sapphire viaduct, dawn, post-fish-famine). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mage commits to ringing the bell at dawn and dusk, tethering the village through persistent modest action with visible cost (his ongoing station on the viaduct). The textural pattern—dripping water, patient accumulation, lukewarm warmth—deepens across the repair sequence and charges the final image ("faint drip of water wearing down stone"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the crack narrows and vanishes through repeated droplet applications, reweighting the dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) with felt cost (hours of work, thin magic, persistent faith). No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's systematic trail-laying and discovery accumulate density that reweights the stakes by dawn. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her mission with the sapphire label as proof that "some truths would not stay submerged," and the cost is conceptual (the town will be flooded again, but memory persists). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One minor causality slip: the cache of intact bottles "as if waiting for a toast that had been interrupted" stretches credibility for fifty years underwater, but does not break the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation establishes who/where/when early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (waterfall, crystal, starlings, flame) toward a final reconfiguration. However, closure occurs entirely in Mira's head via epiphany ("she understood") without on-page action or visible cost—the crystal transformation and her tears are simultaneous with realization, not consequences that foreclose a path. Cost remains asserted ("the touch of wonder") rather than legible in forfeited options or altered tactics. The lack of a dramatized choice or renunciation that narrows future possibility leaves closure feeling conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean and early. The piece follows a causal track: static clears → Elena reports position → storm shifts → narrator revises → Elena emerges safely. However, the closure lacks visible cost; the narrator releases the buckle and returns to watching, a return to equilibrium rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The "watcher's burden carried one more night" reads as Earned Stasis, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page—the narrator will watch again tomorrow exactly as before.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but the closure—"the numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute"—summarizes change rather than dramatizing it through a final image that reweights prior material. The blade-touch moment gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is told ("cracked") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that alters what comes next.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is heavily delayed: who this person is, where the household stands in relation to the tunnel, and what specific loss occurred remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost—the work "continues, as it always had, as it always would" is a declared stasis without visible forfeiture or crystallized options. The drive lens is ambiguous (attempts at Accumulative/Textural but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake), and causality is circular: sound is generated to restore laughter, but no on-page event tests whether it works or what price the conductor pays.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation (who, where, when) arrives within the first sentence and remains stable. The piece attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the guardian stops waiting and walks into the mist), but the cost is asserted through metaphor rather than demonstrated: no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid on the page. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase, pattern break), yet the ending recycles the same waiting/walking motif without a cadence shift or image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Closure form is present but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens and delivers on-page closure: Mara's successive-approximation method culminates in the decisive act of snapping the crozier into three pieces, which vivifies the embers and releases borrowed energy. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (ember nexus, Mara kneeling, twilight), and the "penny drops" moment provides a clear before/after. However, the cost is stated rather than felt—"her hands empty, her purpose fulfilled"—and the final paragraph summarizes transformation ("gave back to the world the energy it had borrowed") instead of dramatizing consequence or foreclosed path, reducing the closure's visceral charge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational pressure (lunar perigee creating a signal window) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mara perceives a cosmic rhythm and carries new understanding forward. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. However, the central beat—the "shard of hush" encounter—unfolds as passive reception rather than causal linkage; Mara stops trying to measure and instead "tunes herself to it," but no on-page choice or forfeiture visibly narrows options. The cost ("she wept") is told, not shown through a tactical sacrifice or renunciation that the reader can trace.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    The orientation Test is satisfied by ~120 words (ferry, deckhand, spectral grotto established early). However, closure lacks visible cost: Maren's merger succeeds without dramatized forfeiture, injury, or consequence—"the ferry continued its route" and "passengers would return home" soft-reset the stakes. The causal chain from "someone was trying to merge the timelines" to Maren's decision is told rather than earned through on-page pressure or choice. The lens reads Causal-aspiring but key linkages (why now, why her, what price) are elided, and the ending offers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost on the page. Apply −0.3 for cost-proof failure and −0.2 for the unmotivated peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through weaving, phosphorescence, lagging reflections, and the eruption hum, then reconfigures at closure when she "sat down among her threads...knowing she would never fully distinguish between the memories she had made and the ones she had been made of." This is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: loss of epistemic certainty). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, what she does). One meaningful deepening occurs when reflections begin to anticipate her actions, reweighting her relationship to her own agency. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraphs (underwater instructor descending to a research lab). The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight underwater—is signaled early and pursued through the calculation scene. However, the closure unit is weak: Mira's realization that "the cosmos was a sea of its own, navigable by anyone willing to learn its currents" reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The news of the visitors' departure arrives off-stage via screen message, and Mira's response is to "hold steady" and continue—an assertion of persistence without a dramatized tradeoff or foreclosed option that would constitute Earned Stasis or Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is timely (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: "the dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard." However, the final paragraph tells us Elena "found Margot's message" and "understood finally" without showing what she finds or how it changes her options—the cost is conceptual but not made undeniable on the page. The causal lens wobbles: does the hearing aid preserve a literal recording, or is this metaphor? The piece does not commit, and the ending's causality (what Elena discovers in the mist, what it forecloses) remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered sensory detail (cables glinting, gold flecks pulsing) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors arrive adequately (Maren, facility, mission brief by ~80 words). However, the closure unit—Maren's dissolution into the network—lacks sufficient felt cost on the page; the "gentle dissolution" undercuts the stakes her claustrophobia established, and the final library metaphor abstracts rather than grounds the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens—ink patterns, heartbeat counting, snow imagery building density—but the closure unit lacks visible cost. Mira's shift from anger to wholeness is told through summary ("felt something...she felt whole") rather than a decisive image or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The architect's transmission arrives as sensation without dramatized consequence, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration that the piece attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through lyric density toward a new language born from dying words, flight patterns, and voice. Orientation anchors arrive late—who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's abstractions. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the curse transforms and a new language emerges, but the cost is asserted ("had given everything") rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or constraint that alters Elara's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by ~150 words, meeting the test. The closure unit—Mira stepping into the harmony—reads as Charged Poise under a Hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative imagery at the end), but the cost is implied rather than legible: what option does she foreclose, what price does she pay? The phone-call structure provides causal linkage (Amari's voice triggers the garden's response), yet the final beat substitutes thematic declaration ("becoming the punchline") for embodied consequence. Escalation occurs (garden shifts, creature emerges) but the protagonist's agency in the turn is passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the statues bend, fruit gleams brighter), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible—Elara does not forfeit or lose anything on the page. The locust shell "slips from her fingers" without felt price, and the final image reads more like a symbolic tableau than a crystallized reconfiguration with palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and follows a clear causal sequence (boy asks → Marcus agrees → delivers). However, the closure lacks felt cost: Marcus performs the same service he's done for fifteen years with the same resolve, so no option is foreclosed and no stance crystallizes. The "respectful rebellion" motif and the thunderstorm vessel appear as thematic ornaments rather than plot drivers—removing them would not alter Marcus's decision or the story's outcome. Under a Causal lens, the ending restates his established pattern without tightening or meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece accumulates density through layered images (carousel, train, oasis, halo) and cadence modulates toward the final static tableau. Orientation anchors (carpenter, train workshop, evening) arrive early. The "wrong turn" coincidence complicates rather than resolves, and the closure reads as Charged Poise—the carpenter holds the fragment, understanding his calling, with the unbuilt carousel projected forward. Cost is implied (decades of frozen labor, now directed) but not enacted on the page; the final image crystallizes intention without visible forfeiture, meeting the CR threshold but leaving emotional price oblique. One escalation deepening (discovery → recognition → commitment) is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Miriam's ritual gathers narrative weight through hyperbolic geometry and the scarf's luminescence to reawaken stored memory. However, closure arrives as convenient success—no decision narrows options, no price is paid, and the woman's 3 AM return feels orchestrated rather than causally motivated. The Cost Proof Test fails: the final paragraph asserts "purpose fulfilled" without pointing to a sentence where Miriam or the woman sacrifices, loses, or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated vitalization attempts until the runaway dream arrives and Mira recognizes her own longing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the end of paragraph one. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira captures her dream and hangs the photograph, settling into Earned Stasis ("in its glow she worked on")—but the cost is implied rather than undeniable on the page. The final image reweights prior material, yet the before/after emotional shift feels softer than the rubric's "felt cost" standard would require for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: seventeen years compress into one night's work, building toward the philosopher's sealed message. However, closure cost is abstract—the locksmith "smiles" and walks home with "fire finally allowed to rest," but no visible price is paid on the page. The escalation is a deepening (garden → fountain → chamber) rather than a causal turn, consistent with the lens, yet the final image does not reweight prior material with felt consequence. One meaningful tightening is present, but cost remains asserted rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately within the first paragraph. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure—memory recovery as a reconfiguration of Elias's empirical stance—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page decision or forfeiture actually changes his options going forward. The causal chain (swim to greenhouse → touch mushroom → memories return) is linear but lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The ending promises future expeditions without visible constraint, reading more like a mission statement than closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (afternoon light, dust motes, shadows, tea leaves build toward a moment of resilience). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by opening paragraph). The closure—the boy reaching for tea, Maren's nod—offers a micro-turn but the cost remains abstract; we see "the first fragile bud" asserted rather than a foreclosed path with felt consequence. The final image ("empty swing...waiting for passengers that would come again") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the pressure felt is diffuse rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (waterfall, ancient trees, heirloom seed) toward a quiet planting that reweights "wonder" as rooted possibility. Closure lands on the page ("weave itself into the fabric of this world, carrying the essence of wonder") but the cost remains conceptual and distant—no tactic changed, no option foreclosed, no felt price visible in the final beat. Orientation is swift (parapet, waterfall, orchard pruner by line one). One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed moves from pocket to soil, yet the act feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, what). The piece accrues symbolic density through knots, masks, prisms, and silence, building toward the final image where the spirit's face reveals Mira's childhood memory and voices rush outward. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the accumulated silence breaks and reweights the premise of binding vs. freeing), though the cost remains conceptual and slightly abstract—Mira is changed by understanding, but the price she pays or path she forecloses is not sharply visible on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, meeting the length standard, but the final beat leans toward epiphany more than embodied forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Elena at Thornmoor henge) and a Situational lens: she interprets archaeological evidence under the pressure of silence and historical mystery. However, the closure—her ascent acknowledging "secrets no longer silent"—lacks visible cost or a decisive reweighting of her stance. The narrative recounts her methodical work but does not dramatize a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts on the page. The final paragraph summarizes thematic achievement rather than landing a charged image, reducing the closure to conceptual claim without felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Miriam's realization that "loss was not an ending but a transition" crystallizes her commitment to deliver Eleanor's message and perhaps release herself from the ocean. The cost is conceptual and felt—she will finally understand how to let go—but not sharply visible in forfeited action. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the snow globe's discovery deepens the thematic stake. One slip: the closure unit relies on reflection more than dramatized choice, which keeps it out of the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and ghost-communication patterns build toward the sung harmony at closure. Orientation anchors (Mira, tower courtyard, three nights running) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—two singers merge across time—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactics altered by prior pressure. The backstory block (ghost's identity, music box origin) occupies roughly 20% and anchors to the bolt plate, yet it doesn't tilt a present micro-choice so much as explain the setup. One meaningful deepening occurs (ghost calls for three nights → Mira finally sings), meeting the length's minimum, but the final image relies on atmospheric assertion ("tinkersong wonder spilling") rather than a concrete, reweighted particular.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. The elevator's ascent structures pressure as a tightening window, and the diary discovery deepens Mira's understanding in a single meaningful intensification. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's decision to return the goggles silently forecloses the path of confrontation or revelation, and the final image—"this one small errand of mercy"—reweights her role with felt cost (she now carries unspoken knowledge). The cost is conceptual and relational, made legible in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observational density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: grief and science "spool together"). Orientation anchors cleanly (Miriam, gondola, eleven days post-accident). Cost is felt—acceptance of the colleague's loss and the broken string—but the final image ("something she could carry forward") leans toward summary declaration rather than a concrete on-page moment that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear who/what/where anchors and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coin's pattern guides Mira's craft, density increases as she paints, and the final image reweights preservation as transformation. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira completes the work and leaves with the coin, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The ending offers conceptual repricing (limits are scales of perception) but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and tracks causally: Bren's observation → Mira's pattern study → hopscotch discovery → all-night synthesis. However, the closure lands as summary ("she had captured their secret") rather than a decisive on-page change or renunciation with felt cost. The final beat tells us she will present findings and "savored the moment" without showing what was foreclosed, risked, or altered. Under a Causal lens the ending delivers information gain but no visible price or option-narrowing that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a clear spatial anchor (frozen library, hall of mirrors) and tracks Thessa's descent, but the central action—placing gears against the mirror—lacks meaningful resistance or reversal. The "prophecy scraps" motivate her arrival yet impose no interpretive challenge or cost; she simply enacts what the riddle prescribes. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she steps through into "her destiny"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option accompanies her passage. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered images building toward a final threshold), and under that lens the ending reweights prior material, though the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: messages accumulate, the garden emerges, restoration proceeds, the bell rings, and the ending reweights the community's identity. Orientation anchors arrive late (Outpost Seventeen, orchard planet, floating arches) but are legible by ~15% without causing confusion at closure, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the community becomes "family by choice" through collective effort), but the cost is asserted ("strangers no longer") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. No meaningful tightening or narrowing of options occurs; the garden simply awaits their labor and blooms without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric density building toward the clock's final chime. Orientation arrives late—who, where, and when coalesce only after extended description of the mechanism—but the disorientation effect is arguably purposeful and the pattern is taught by the second paragraph; waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the clock chimes once and "held its breath along with the universe, waiting for the next song to begin." Cost is implied (the world transitions) but not viscerally felt on the page; the final image recharges prior motifs without a decisive causal turn or forfeiture that narrows Elara's options. The lens holds, but the cost proof is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (cliffside orchard, mechanical birds, labyrinth below) and the causal spine holds under a Causal lens: blueprint discovery → nut placement → path opens. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost—Mira commits to the caretaker role she resisted, opening the hidden stairs and rising to guide the travelers. The "stone floor shuddered… began to assemble" moment crystallizes the transformation with tactile immediacy. One hairline slip: the blueprint's "three winters" backstory feels slightly unmotivated (why locked away?), but it doesn't break the through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Miriam's grief and the symbolic chrysalis accrue meaning through layered reflection and recurring foam imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the insight that "separation and connection are the same thing"). Orientation is swift (name, profession, location, and backstory anchor by the second paragraph). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—she accepts carrying grief rather than dissolving it—and the final image ("braided ravine holds all its streams") reweights prior material. However, the tightening is solely reflective; no on-page event or choice narrows options between opening and ending, reducing escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through repeated imagery (bottles, moonlight, absence) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the vendor reframes her work from selling blank slates to "illuminating the gaps." Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—her understanding deepens, but no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The reconfiguration charges the premise but the price remains oblique, capping the closure effect in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Miriam methodically works through the pavilion, and closure arrives as Earned Stasis—she emerges knowing "some memories would always taste like sorrow, and that was not a failure but a kind of endurance." Orientation anchors quickly (chef/desert/pavilion), and the three-day work sequence provides one meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the final image ("sturdy brittle"), though it leans abstract. The lens holds without contradiction, and the RR form (endurance that forecloses the path of emptying the pavilion entirely) is valid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the repaired clock and returned cuckoo, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legibly tied to Elara's agency on the page. The final paragraph summarizes transformation ("communities, like clocks, could be repaired") instead of landing a decisive image where pressure crystallizes. Causality is present but elliptical—weeks of work are compressed into summary, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climax. The orientation is clear, so no penalty applies there, but the closure unit lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memories layer, mirror accumulates meaning), but the closure unit lacks legible cost—Mira gains powers and purpose without visible trade-off or renunciation. The transformation is asserted ("fundamentally different," "true purpose achieved") but no before/after choice or foreclosed option appears on the page. The mirror "becomes whole" in a metaphorical sense that doesn't reweight prior material with felt consequence. Orientation is clear early (moonlit canyon, Mira walking switchbacks), so no penalty there, but the ending delivers revelation without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds density through recurring imagery (prism, spiral-wave, doodles) and inverts gravity to enable access. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Calyx carries the knowledge as "seeds planted in fertile soil," reweighting her archive work with cost implied (she will be "changed, blazing"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the markings resolve and she grasps the pattern as "a way of thinking." The cost is conceptual—she's transformed but the price (potential conflict with the head archivist, the twenty-year wait for the next inversion) is stated, not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph, avoiding orientation debt. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers sensory and conceptual density (insulator discovery, stress-crack analysis, instrument construction, sound emergence) and concludes with a cadence shift—the siskin's call breaking silence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the world "learning to speak again"), reweighting the dominant stake with conceptual cost (the fragility and patience required). One meaningful deepening occurs when the porcelain's stress cracks transform from historical artifact to resonant nodes. The cost, however, remains largely implied rather than viscerally felt on the page, preventing entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (who, where, when). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, image, and motif without causal linkage or situational reversal. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final eclipse metaphor reweighting the covenant, but no on-page cost is legible—the tutor's circumstances, stance, and options remain unchanged from opening to close. The eclipse retreats, but no action, forfeiture, or realization alters what the tutor can or will do next, reducing the ending to thematic summary rather than felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the first paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the locked clasp provides a frame, reflection on silence varieties deepens the thematic texture, and the fireworks supply a timed pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the clasp opens and Mira writes a final catalog entry that reweights her life's work—but the cost is conceptual and oblique; we do not see what she forfeits or risks by this breakthrough. The "nearly losing it" insight is told rather than enacted, weakening the on-page cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Kalia's three-month tending accumulates pressure through repeated exposure to the flower's developing scent, and the bloom provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (her ambition reorganizes into "something truer") with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (treetop village, healing house, Elder Sholomi). The escalation is primarily durational rather than causal—weeks pass with incremental discoveries—but the closure image (wildflower from spiral) reweights the opening "hush before bloom" motif with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the middle months compress into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Cora's Earned Stasis (leaving the arrow tip, carrying only knowledge) forecloses exploitation with felt cost. Orientation anchors early (orchard pilot, vessel, planet). The gravity inversion provides a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake. One weakness: the echoes' "warning" conveniently delivers the moral calculus rather than forcing Cora to earn the insight through dramatized friction, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: environmental detail and wind-pattern documentation build toward the convergence-point realization. Orientation anchors clearly (port, fog, evacuation, investigator role) within the opening. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing—"some accidents were not accidents at all"—with the reweighting of the freighter disaster from mechanical failure to environmental design flaw. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant; Mira's stance doesn't visibly foreclose a path or impose felt sacrifice on the page, weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough, so no penalty is applied here. However, closure fails the cost-proof test—the final paragraph declares wonder "certified" and "begun again," but no on-page sentence shows what Yara sacrificed, lost, or gave up to achieve this. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural (aurora + bell-song layering), yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt pressure. The sculptor cameo at midpoint and end attempts simultaneity but adds no causal pressure or cost to Yara's arc, reading as decorative rather than a functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through reflection, spatial movement, and the flute's recurring presence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kira "carried the flute with a different understanding." The cost—accepting witness over action, foreclosing the guardian role—is felt and legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flute shifts from "reminder of everything she had failed" to symbol of continuity and witness. The single-scene, single-POV structure and one transition fit scope defaults cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens—stars vanish, the halo fragment appears, Maren's workshop continues—building density through repeated cosmic imagery and the mathematics-of-emotion premise. Orientation is delayed: we learn "Maren" and "topaz workshop" early, but "where" and "when" remain dreamlike; the disorientation feels purposeful (supporting the "deliberate ambiguity" method) and coheres with the tone, so I waive the Orientation Test penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren becomes transparent, the fragment dissolves, and her work "continued...an endless transcription of questions"—but the cost is conceptual (she becomes light) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters prior options on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices, and the final paragraph does reweight the opening's sorrow and patience; however, the Cost Proof Test reveals no exact sentence where Maren loses a concrete capability, relationship, or choice—she gains liberation, which reads more as reward than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery, pendant vibration, memory-to-myth frame accumulate toward a resonant reconfiguration). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts her role as "a courier not just of objects but of possibilities," crystallizing her stance with undeniable thematic pressure. Cost is felt—three years of grief and scattered confidence reconfigured into mission—but the price is abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint accompanies the shift. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The accumulative design coheres, but the final image leans heavily on Mira's monologue rather than Elara's enacted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: who (Mira), where (quartz arbor), and when (winter morning) by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns deepen across seventeen winters, the woman's essence softens over three years, and the final image reweights Mira's role from observer to participant. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final realization that she has poured herself into the place reweights all prior documentation with conceptual cost—she is now part of the archive she studies. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees her reflection overlaid with her grandmother's, crystallizing the inheritance. The cost, however, remains oblique; we feel her merging with stone but do not see a concrete path foreclosed or a live option abandoned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural through ritual description, but closure—the spinner's self-transformation—occurs off-stage in summary ("began to unravel herself") with no on-page action or image that makes the cost felt. The causality is unclear: what specific sacrifice does she make, and how does her consciousness flowing into the bead differ from metaphor? Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who she is, her specific goal, the orchard's spatial reality remain vague), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The final paragraph asserts completion without showing the transformation or its price.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: Cael's patient labor accretes across seasons, and the closure image—pale blossoms pushing through ash—reweights the devastation with visible cost (his unseen labor, the deliberate secrecy). However, the escalation occurs almost entirely off-page in summary ("three seasons past," "the awakenings came slowly"), and the final beat lands more as thematic assertion than dramatized consequence. The orientation test is satisfied early (blacksmith, Thrennis, orchard blight), but the causal spine connecting his underground work to the surface blossoms is told rather than shown, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Kira reweights her ability from gift to wound and finds purpose in that acceptance. However, the closure cost is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page—"she was no longer the same person" asserts transformation without showing the forfeited path or visible price. The causal chain from climbing the catwalk to pressing the shard to seeing the parallel self to lowering her hand relies on convenience: the shimmer delivers the exact epiphany she needs without resistance or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (skipper, lighthouse, weekly provisions). The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: stone discoveries layer toward a ritual understanding, culminating in Maren's offering that reignites the lamp. However, the closure—lamp flickers to life, grandmother's presence dissolves—reads as coincidental reward rather than earned Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the light's return. The cause-effect chain (stones ask for help → Maren places sea glass and stacks stones → lamp fires) lacks dramatized resistance or price, weakening the Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (laughter, glass, starlight) and the final image reconfigures the keeper's isolation as gift and burden. However, the closure lacks decisive cost—the ships are saved, the keeper remains unchanged, and no visible price is paid on the page. The RR reads as a mood statement rather than a stance crystallization with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density around the butterfly wing and the heart transplant, building toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure relies on restating the central question ("why some people magnetize stories") and answering it through direct articulation rather than an image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The decision to "return to his dye vats changed" is declared but not tested on the page, weakening the RR claim.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who, where, and when cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she descends "knowing that to maintain a labyrinth is sometimes to unmake it"—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or image. The escalation is a density increase (storm, sextant use, unfolding vision) without a narrowing choice or causal turn, which is acceptable under Accumulative, but the final line tells us the reweighting rather than showing it through a concrete sacrifice or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, stakes). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward a final image of dawn breaking. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara pours herself into the Heart-Tree, releasing light), but the cost—"becoming less whole"—is told rather than shown through a concrete before/after that makes the sacrifice legible in action or perception. The mica windows shattering and dawn arriving provide visual spectacle, but the felt price of Elara's transformation remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Charged Poise closure: Mira's decision to write tomorrow reconfigures her stance from hiding to engagement. Orientation anchors (Whitmore & Sons, Arbor Street, eleven-forty-seven) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page action or visible forfeiture accompanies the resolution. The reflective density (~40% of the text) does interleave with present stimuli (the invitation, the clock, the chair) but the closure beat itself is a stated intention rather than a dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and philosophical reflection around restoration rituals, building to the butterfly emergence and bread-breaking as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts incomplete absolution and commits to continue). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure image reweights prior material with felt cost (accepting incompleteness), but the escalation is gentle density increase rather than a sharp tightening—one meaningful deepening is present. Cost is conceptual and emotional but legible in "tenuous absolution was still absolution, still a form of grace."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors early (archivist, frozen archive, observatory dome) and establishes a clear situational pressure: luminous vows are fading, demanding measurement before they dissolve. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the archivist shifts from preservation to understanding, accepting transformation as evolution), and the cost is conceptual—her life's work changes meaning. However, the turn occurs through observation and philosophical adjustment rather than a causal chain of protagonist decisions that narrow options. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive reweighting at the end, and the closure is legible, though the conceptual cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Mara, pirate market beneath pier, night moving toward sunrise). Closure attempts Charged Poise—the woman's cryptic answer and the warming watch fob suggest a reconfiguration of Mara's understanding—but the cost remains implicit rather than legible on the page. The causal lens is muddied: early beats suggest accumulative atmosphere-building, but the ending gesture (the woman's recognition, the warming fob) implies a situational pressure that never crystallizes into a clear stance choice. The drive lens remains ambiguous at closure, weakening the ending's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: convergence builds through sensory accretion (aurora, compass, Seren's arrival) toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph where skepticism is reweighted. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt; the final image ("tasted like possibility") restates theme without a visible price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass "emerges" into a bridge, satisfying length expectations, but the closure lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, by ~100 words). The piece commits to a reflective-accumulative lens: Mira descends, encounters the unfinished portrait, remembers her suppression, and begins to complete it as remedy. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): kneeling before the canvas with "I begin" crystallizes her choice to uncork creativity, forecloses the path of judgment, and charges the final image with the cost of facing her complicity. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length; cost is legible in her facing what her silence caused.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments assemble (plate, map, letters) toward a charged final image where Mira begins to write, reweighting the premise of silence and lost speech. Orientation anchors (Mira, greenhouse city, post-oasis drought) land early enough. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise—where she accepts her師傅's silence by continuing his work, foreclosing the path of retrieval with the felt cost of inheritance. One persistent weakness: the map's treasure-hunt mechanics feel convenient rather than causally earned, and the room's discovery lands without sufficient resistance or complication to charge the escalation fully.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (who, where, when by the second paragraph) and coheres around the sculpture's completion. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (satisfaction crystallized; "The fragment held its color") with conceptual cost implied through the years of labor and seasonal constraint, though the cost is more告知 than felt on this final page. The accumulative method—layering description, backstory, and thematic reflection—builds density, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the sculpture moves, Juniper approves, Elara is satisfied. One modest micro turn (Juniper's arrival shifts the scene's emotional register slightly) does not alter options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly within the first paragraph (who/where/when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the failing roses, the magnetic storm, and Cara's static until the controlled burn reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the box emptied, fears miniaturized, Cara standing among restored roses with visible cost (fragmentation/wholeness trade). One meaningful deepening through the box-opening and miniaturization sequence. The cost is felt but could be more concretely dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, building from courtyard stillness through layered revelations to a final image of continued listening. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. However, the closure arrives as summary rather than on-page discovery—"the story spread," "more people brought," "Elena proved"—telling us about transformation rather than showing a decisive moment. The cost (what Elena gives up or risks) remains abstract; we see no forfeited path or visible price paid at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit—water draining and Mira stepping into freedom—lacks visible cost or meaningful reversal; it reads as a predetermined sequence she rigged years ago, removing present agency. The inferred lens appears Causal early (descent → chamber → dance activates mechanism), but the dance-as-unlock feels convenient rather than earned by on-page problem-solving. Orientation is delayed: who she is, why she's here, and what the regime did remain vague past the first third, requiring the reader to assemble context from scattered backstory fragments. The "rigged this, of course" revelation undercuts tension by confirming no real stakes existed in the present window.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mira is beyond "lantern lighter," why she is at the chamber this morning, and what specific choice she faces remain vague past the first third. The closure unit—touching the crystal to recover her mother's memory—lands on the page but carries no visible cost; the "time to let the light in" reads as thematic assertion rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Causality is weak: the whale's death "cracked something open" without showing how that event compels Mira's descent today rather than yesterday. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (salt crystals accumulate memories, coffee grounds map the route, the final image recharges "lantern lighter of forgotten things"), but the piece does not teach this pattern early or tighten it through a cadence shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (brook, origami wing, silence-mapping) rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the summoner understands the prophecy as "desperate plea from a future self," reweighting her magic as receptive rather than combative. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of tactics occurs. The final image of the wing floating downstream gestures toward consequence but doesn't anchor a felt price, keeping this below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through recursive imagery (buildings, language, seals, stars) and shifts cadence at the meteor-shower interrogation, which narrows options and crystallizes Elena's stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elena's hand-over-hand gesture and decision to accept mystery reconfigures the relationship with undeniable pressure, though the cost (living with uncertainty, accepting the tutor's undead nature) is more felt than explicitly paid on the page. The final-paragraph reflection ("the language of walls that had witnessed everything") reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening is present; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by paragraph two (Mira, research station garden, twilight). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: sensory density builds as twilight deepens and the shell's whispers resolve into Elena's voice. However, closure lacks decisive cost—Mira's resolve to "complete the archive" is declared, not tested, and no live option is foreclosed on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: the final paragraph asserts transformation ("skeptic's heart finally opened") but shows no concrete price paid or tactic altered.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure unit—Yuki's realization that she has "unlinked herself from the chain of complicity"—is a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern of intensification is unclear: the key's metaphorical nature, the crumbling wall, and the decision to carry knowledge rather than documents all arrive without prior tension or constraint. Orientation is delayed but functional (who/where/when anchor by ~150 words). The causality is soft: the Archive Keeper's arrival and the hidden documents lack because/therefore linkage to Yuki's present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers setting, backstory, and thematic concern toward a moment of entry. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elara steps into the song at the alignment—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized (no visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page). The nexus setup and celestial trigger provide structure, yet the final act ("stepped into") functions as threshold gesture rather than a choice with legible consequences. Orientation anchors are present early (canyon singer, nexus, starlight, seashell).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation arrives late—who she is and what she's doing in the glacier shrine becomes clear only after multiple paragraphs of abstract mood-setting, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens wavers between accumulative-textural (collecting dream fragments) and causal (investigating to name the child), never cohering under one dominant frame by midpoint. The closure—deciding to find living relatives—is announced as intention rather than executed on the page, offering no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; the final paragraph summarizes what she will do rather than showing her doing it or facing a price. The snow globe's "patient melting" recurs but doesn't tighten options or create a meaningful pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (moon paths, fireflies, whisk, nets) that reweight the appreciation-of-hidden-effort stake. The closure—whistle召唤ing fireflies, feeling the pattern complete, then descending to mend nets—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her stance. Cost is implied but not viscerally legible on the page: no visible forfeiture or trade-off marks the final image, only readiness. Orientation Test penalty waived; pattern taught early. Closure lands but cost remains oblique (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through investigative fragments toward a conceptual repricing (the diamond as data, not curse). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's realization and her decision to stay—reconfigures the stillpoint metaphor, but the cost remains abstract; the final image asserts patience and fragment-reassembly without showing what path she foreclosed or what tangible price she paid. The weeks of letter reconstruction are summarized rather than dramatized, weakening causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: static listening → fragmented prophecy repetition → storm intensification → portico crack → figure emergence. Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words (Elara, observatory, seven years alone). The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the rise of the prophet had begun"), but the cost remains atmospheric and conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on Elara's part. The portico's crack and the figure's arrival feel coincidental rather than driven by Elara's agency, weakening closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established (vagrant poet, coastal dunes, dawn routine) but the piece operates as a retrospective summary rather than a pressured scene. The music box discovery offers a potential turn, but the granddaughter's arrival and the poet's later career shift are narrated in past-habitual and summary mode. The final paragraph's "Years later" frame confirms this is Accumulative/Reflective, yet no single moment crystallizes with visible cost—handing over the box lacks friction, and the career pivot is asserted rather than shown with a forfeited path. Closure reads as thematic declaration ("connection, the most permanent currency") instead of an on-page image or action that reweights prior material with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph without penalty. The piece follows a causal lens: Maren's training → problem diagnosis → key adjustment → harmonic resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change (the harbor shifts from threatened to safe) with a felt cost (exhaustion and relief), and the inferred lens holds. However, the cost is summarized rather than shown in a final image that reweights prior material; "slumped against the lighthouse wall, exhaustion and relief" tells the outcome without a concrete sensory or choice-based close. The escalation tightens once (crystal tone warping, ice shuddering), meeting the minimum for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored by the opening paragraph (−0 penalty). The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through ritual observation and lunar tracking, but the closure moment ("unyoking the ancient energies") remains abstract declaration rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("changes that no other cartographer would think to map") without showing what has altered on the page or what Kira has forfeited. Cost Proof Test: no exact sentence makes cost legible at the ending beat (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (Elena, tunnel, post-drought investigation). The piece follows a causal track until the supernatural memory flood, which breaks earned causality—Thomas Wright's identity and history arrive via unexplained psychic transfer rather than investigative deduction. The closure (filing the report, preparing independent copies) constitutes a decision with professional cost, but that cost remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized on the page. The drought-as-revelation frame provides thematic coherence but the core turn depends on a mechanism the story never establishes or earns.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through reflection and recurring images (light, clockwork, restoration) that converge at closure. Orientation is clear by paragraph one. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (bordering on Conceptual Repricing): the music fills the shop "like light breaking through storm clouds," reweighting the repair as apology-into-action with felt cost in "the calm before realization." The cost is implied rather than on-page visible (we don't see Thomas's labor or sacrifice in concrete terms), which keeps this out of the high 8s. One meaningful deepening occurs when Thomas hesitates and decides to inscribe the blessing, narrowing his approach from mechanical fix to intentional gift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the kaleidoscope sessions, the arrow tip's integration, and the workshop's hum, culminating in the bell-ringing image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist achieves the yearning's goal and accepts the future recognition), but the cost remains conceptual and distanced ("someone would remember this moment") rather than viscerally paid on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; causality within the chosen lens holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early (memory keeper, sublevel server farm, Thursday cold case). Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the recurring numbers function as breadcrumbs (causal), but the ending leans toward Charged Poise—Maren "began to trace" rather than completing a decisive change. The closure image ("following the numbers into the silence") suggests ongoing commitment but lacks on-page felt cost; the "could restore...or...let the absence remain" fork is stated without resolution, weakening the cost proof. One tightening occurs when Maren discovers the Prometheus lie, narrowing her understanding and escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors early (lighthouse keeper, orchard, ice) and builds a Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to use the fragment to see more clearly rather than repair it. The closure reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing her stance, but the felt cost is implicit rather than visceral; the "weighted breath before reply" frames intention but doesn't land a decisive forfeiture on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images reweight meaning), held consistently, though the final move feels more described than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the drift-ice marina, parasol tip, and volunteer work layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final paragraph where "looseness felt less like loss and more like preparation." Orientation is clear early (marina, three months post-diagnosis, volunteer work). The closure is legible as Charged Poise—she crystallizes her stance and departs—but the cost remains implied rather than undeniable on the page; we infer rather than witness what she forfeits by this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: layers of reflection and image build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of loss). However, the closure moment—pocketing the fragment "one final time" and walking toward the pavilion "ready to watch"—offers emotional resolution by declaration rather than a sharp image or act that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("Sometimes its role was to teach...") replaces scene pressure. Cost is asserted, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a meditative, cyclic structure but lacks a decisive tightening or cost at closure. Mira's final walk back to the parapet mirrors her opening patrol without a visible reweighting of options or meaning. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the ending restates the premise without felt consequence. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the absence of closure cost caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene (lavender field) with clear spatial anchors by the opening third, meeting the Orientation Test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maren layers observation and reflection to deepen meaning. However, closure lacks visible cost; the final paragraph asserts "collective healing" and "satisfied" resolution without an on-page change in options, knowledge, or stance. The photograph is "held together" but this act does not foreclose a live alternative or impose a felt price, reducing the ending to thematic summary rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (cataloguing words, library as organism, fractured sequences) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly: Elias, shadowed library, post-final-dictionary dawn. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration through the crystal's return and Elias's silent testimony—a Charged Poise moment where "silence was not the absence of speech but its most honest form" reweights the opening premise. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the foreclosure of language itself and Elias's acceptance of that fullness. The tightening is legible (crystal taken → crystal returned with reweighted meaning), though the cost remains more intellectual than felt on the body or in immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Mira, fog sculpture garden) and establishes a coherent accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through sensory layering and the protagonist's embodied search for "the sound of growing older." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira stops seeking the future and aligns with what has "already passed through," and the tidal longing settles "into something quieter, something that felt almost like peace." The cost is conceptual (renunciation of forward prophecy) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the expected sound ("groan of rust") gives way to the intimate "shift of a child's spine growing longer," reweighting her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the narrator moves from trying to stop time to capturing motion-as-stillness, reweighting the broken promise and the spinning hand with visible cost—accepting the father will not return. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through metaphor and reflection, then shifts cadence at the camera work to charge the final image. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (observatory, sage camera repairer, workshop location). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tremor forces the narrator to restructure understanding rather than the mechanism. Cost is legible: grief transformed but not erased, the hand still spinning, the promise unfulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first third (Elara, hospice, post-diagnosis). The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's work with Margery deepens through sensory ritual and the vinyl shard accrues meaning across beats, culminating in Margery's recognition and grip—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where both women acknowledge their shared trajectory. Cost is felt in Elara's sharpened mortality and Margery's isolation, though the cost remains more atmospheric than decisively forecloses a path. The closure lands on the page with coherence, but the final "finding their way home" phrase edges toward theme summary rather than pure image, and the cost could be more visibly tied to a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern accumulation via circles and shadow layering). Orientation is established early (observatory, post-Bend world). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—noon shadows are "light folded back upon itself"—but the cost is conceptual assertion rather than felt or visible on the page. The seven-circle sequence deepens pattern but lacks a tangible trade-off or consequence that makes before/after legible with stakes. No persistent constraint shaped tactics; the key and circles simply work when performed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to present stimuli (the archway, the fountain, the tooth) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness as acceptance of fracture) with visible emotional cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tooth's glow reweights the garden and Elara's stance. Slight drag: the ministry subplot (substitute body, officials) adds texture but doesn't tighten options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sea glass collection → pearl discovery → polishing → sanctuary transformation builds through density and pattern rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: earthbound acceptance reimagined as groundward radiance), but the cost remains abstract—"patience and her grief"—rather than a visible on-page forfeiture. The middle discovery ("not clouded at all but filled with captured light") functions as convenient epiphany rather than pressure-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density through the moss-garden visits, the amber pendant, and the drip-pattern motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "simply stay"). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (data center, post-confession). Cost is felt but oblique—the narrator's isolation and the mother's trembling hands carry emotional weight, but no concrete option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The closure image reweights prior material without a decisive turn, which fits the lens but limits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered imagery (shell, mist, abandoned characters) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist's readiness to write after solemnizing her failures. Orientation anchors are present early (coastal path, dusk, mist). The escalation reads as a deepening via the gallery of ghosts that reweights her stance from mourning to acceptance, with the cost legible in "years" and "hollow in her chest." One tightening is sufficient at this length, and the closure image (walking toward the page) reconfigures prior material with felt opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals accumulative/textural mode early (dawn alignment, ancient cycle, patient work) and delivers a coherent closure image: the moonvine blooms, the old practices return. Cost is implied—seventeen years of waiting, generational duty—but not felt on the page; the final paragraph declares restoration without dramatizing sacrifice or foreclosed options. The orientation anchor (who, where, when) arrives cleanly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the golden threads emerge, but the transition from dormant to blooming happens without reversal or complication, reducing pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise): Elara completes her ritual, creating a map "ready to guide whoever found it next." The orientation is clear early (withered orchard, subarctic twilight, crater floor). However, the escalation is primarily textural—density of imagery increases—but no meaningful tightening of options or knowledge occurs on the page; the flash-paper ignition was always the intended endpoint. Cost is implied (years of practice, the patient labor) but not legibly enacted in this window; the final image recharges prior motifs without dramatizing a trade-off or refusal that forecloses a path within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of observation build toward the insight that the timer is "waiting" and must "harvest echoes differently." However, the closure—Elira's realization and commitment to work "in seasons"—lacks visible or felt cost on the page; the final image offers conceptual repricing without dramatizing what she forfeits or risks. The linkage from observation to decision is more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (shingled hush, fractal patterns, calcification creeping upward) toward a final sonic image that reweights the grotto's nature. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the bronze grotto paragraph. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she adds the final thread, another layer settles, and the whalebone song rises—but the cost remains oblique; calcification is already underway and her acceptance was signaled early, so the ending deepens rather than decisively changes her stance. One meaningful accumulation toward the final image is present, satisfying the length requirement, though the conceptual cost could be more legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density around the carving act, with a cadence shift in the final paragraph that attempts to crystallize "here and gone" as unified. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the lion's glass eyes signal completion, a form of Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or alteration of tactics on the page, only the assertion that "the work was keeping hold." Orientation anchors (widow, loft, afternoon) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she touches the mane and the lion "emerged from the grain," though the final lines drift into thematic summary rather than a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Mira accepts exhaustion as terminus), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete forfeiture or choice that alters her situation on the page. The carousel's silence "answers" her, yet that answer is asserted rather than shown through image or action that reweights prior fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens early (discover → calculate → propose → approve) and delivers an on-page decision to redirect water flows, but closure cost remains abstract: we're told the project begins, yet no visible trade-off, renunciation, or interpersonal friction charges the final image. The sextant becomes a desk ornament rather than a constraint that alters her next move. Orientation is clean, escalation is present in the form of expanding civic vision, but the ending summarizes hope ("the only appropriate response") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses a live alternative with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The winding of the clock delivers an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—the protagonist accepts impermanence and sets the mechanism free, forecloses the dream of finishing it "correctly," and the final tick that "did not stop" reweights all prior material with undeniable pressure. The single-scene, single-POV structure and one meaningful deepening (understanding peace as companion to grief) fit the length. Cost is legible in the release of a twenty-year grip.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist gathers fragments toward understanding) and anchors who/where/when adequately. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Konstantýn shifts from victim to architect—but this reversal is delivered through summary narration ("she realized") rather than dramatized pressure. The cost is conceptual but not viscerally legible on the page; she simply "steers the barge toward" the next step with no visible sacrifice, foreclosed path, or felt consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs, but without on-page cost the closure reads thin.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens by midpoint: Elias examines the rope, and the fulgurite glass reveals hidden patterns. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph (golden dock, snow, fog, harbor). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that reweights his life's work) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: he commits to planting seeds and weaving patterns forward. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass reframes the knots, tightening his understanding and future intent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates density through layered images (garden, thread, light, silence) and the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the traveler understands her staying as "the beginning of healing" and the "first stroke of the map." However, the cost is implied rather than concretely legible; no on-page sentence shows what she forfeits by missing the ship or what price accompanies her decision to stay. The ending reconfigures her stance but lacks a felt sacrifice that would charge the closure image under the chosen lens. The accumulative design is clear, but the closure moment remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (bedraggled prince, suspended palace, seventeen-day journey). The piece follows a single-POV accumulative/textural lens where density builds toward a final reconceptualization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the egg's golden veins spell instructions for integration rather than destruction, reweighting the premise. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image, only the implication of a "long walk back" with trembling heart. The causality from discovery to decision is compressed into summary ("he understood at last") rather than a dramatized beat that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the second sentence (who, where, turnout coat anchoring the firefighter role). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's realization that destruction and renewal are one dance, then her return to the village—but the turn is conceptual and told ("she understood finally") rather than dramatized through a decision or renunciation with visible cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the layered images (lagoon, sand, coin, clouds) modulate cadence, but the ending softens into summary rather than a charged final image. No single meaningful tightening narrows options on the page; pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative lens early—breadcrumbs leading through fountains, memories pressing against glass—and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors are present (city, Mira, stained glass box) within the opening window. The final liberation and release of memories constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize, the box opens, memories disperse, and Mira's understanding shifts. Cost is somewhat abstract—she loses the mystery's weight, gains changed skepticism—but the image of her sitting with the empty box carries felt closure even if the emotional price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who (Vael, otherworldly custodian), where (nebula garden center), and when (annual shedding cycle) within the first third. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (sonar, petals, gear's ticking) and the gear's awakening deepens the dominant stake (custodianship's meaning). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final sonar ping and the knowledge that "the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be" reweights the ritual with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual—Vael's comprehension shifts—but the exact on-page sentence proving felt cost is elusive, weakening the closure's bite. The ticking gear moment is a strong turn, but the resolution pivot feels slightly asserted rather than bodied forth.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details layer toward a resonant final image. However, the closure effect—Elara's understanding of collective grief and her return to the workshop—lacks visible cost; the realization is told rather than made legible through a decisive image or action that reweights prior material. The butterfly migration provides a temporal frame, but no on-page tightening narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending summarizes thematic arrival without demonstrating what was sacrificed or foreclosed to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through recurring images (obsidian, pendulum, inscriptions) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) in the final descent with cost distributed across the ritual rather than a sharp turn. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Marcus carries his guilt down, one footfall at a time—but the 37-second pause doesn't tighten options as promised; it functions as lyric space rather than a decision gate. One meaningful deepening (the apex moment) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles atmospheric fragments (cemetery opening → cobalt silo → tapestry decoding → breadcrumb realization) toward a closure that reweights the gardener's role as listener. The final image—"uncharted echoes...found their listener at last"—offers Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract; no visible price is paid, no option is foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs (the sovereign's question revealed in the threads), but the closure effect lacks the felt weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "when" remains vague (morning light, three days ago, but no forward clock). The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through reflection and description toward the moment the quill touches page, but no on-page reversal or causal turn narrows options. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final sentence crystallizes readiness—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("harder gift of informed possibility") rather than dramatized through forfeited choice or visible consequence. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks a felt price legible in action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with orientation anchors (who, where, when) and establishes a coherent setting and backstory frame. However, there is no on-page closure event: Mira begins her broadcast as she has done before, with no decisive change, renunciation, or visible cost that reweights prior material. The ending ("continued her quiet revolution") summarizes ongoing action rather than crystallizing a before/after shift. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere and detail), but without a turn, deepening, or charged final image that reconfigures the dominant stake, closure does not land on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritual assembles ash into mask, layering memory and grief through transformation. Orientation anchors who and where early (Mira, gallery, grandmother's death three days ago). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the mask "glowing softly," Mira carrying fragments toward the door—but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally legible on the page. The ritual follows a ceremonial logic rather than causal pressure that narrows options; "perhaps the reaching mattered more than the grasping" articulates theme but does not reweight a visible stake or foreclose a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sedimentary evidence and competing narratives but lacks a decisive on-page change or meaningful tightening. Closure reads as thematic restatement ("at least one person refused the easy story") rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—the narrator's solitary work continues unchanged, and no live option is foreclosed. Orientation is clear early (flooded harbor lab, post-plague scholar). The chronometer cog and sediment metaphor recur but do not pivot the narrator's stance or alter present options; the ending summarizes commitment rather than crystallizing new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through layered reflection and a charged final image that reweights the rosette motif and Eleanor's long unlearning. Orientation anchors early (Eleanor, velvet library, autumn, zither). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the rosette "held its worn flower steady, as it always had, as it always would, for as long as someone remembered to look" crystallizes endurance with implied cost (the conditional "for as long as"). The final image charges prior material, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph but "when" remains vague beyond "tonight" until the celestial alignment is invoked. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elena arrives, kneels, tastes, understands, and rises with a plan. However, the closure lacks decisive on-page cost—she intends to build a kitchen and teach, but no path is visibly foreclosed and no price paid within the text. The seed dissolves and she prunes "in earnest," yet the transformation from ruin to "something new" occurs off-page ("By morning"). Without a legible cost moment, the Resonant Reconfiguration does not fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure unit—lights flickering back and Elara understanding her "true purpose"—delivers statement rather than a resonant image with legible cost. The riddle's "reveal" mechanic arrives late and resolves without prior complication or visible price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the toll booth scene, waiving the Orientation Test penalty, but the causality between reading the riddle aloud and the drones "waiting" remains unexplained metaphor rather than earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric elements, building density through sensory detail and recursive observation. However, closure fails the cost test: the final "quiet blaze of recognition" offers conceptual repricing without demonstrable on-page cost—Mira arrives at understanding but forfeits nothing and alters no tactic. The grandmother's presence three nights ago (coffee cup residue) creates a temporal inconsistency since the framing suggests the grandmother is deceased ("thirty years after her grandmother stopped grinding"), yet the sensory evidence implies recent occupation. This causality slip undermines the accumulative logic at a pivotal observational beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly (statue, underwater garden, three thousand years) within the first paragraph. The cascade structure—child's terror → alchemist's memory → fish perspectives → diver encounter—accumulates pressure and reweights Thalassor's purpose. Closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he remains a statue but transforms his role from guardian to witness) with conceptual cost legible in "keeper of questions instead of answers." One weakness: the alchemist's revelation and the diver's arrival function as received knowledge rather than protagonist-driven turns, softening agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered reflection and the cadence shifts at the end when understanding "arrives just when she had stopped expecting it," reweighting the dominant stake (comprehension vs. escape). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Conceptual Repricing—where the staircase is reinterpreted from "confinement" to "boundlessness," but the conceptual cost (years of misinterpretation, the weight of captivity) remains oblique and not sharply legible in a final image or action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory and thematic density through the greenhouse space, moonlight, and the lost language until the daydream crystallizes meaning and Mira writes the phrase. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she understands the language, decides to leave paintings, and finally sleeps—a visible stance shift with felt cost (loneliness → connection, insomnia → rest). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream becomes "sharp, specific" and she decodes the script. Cost is legible in the shift from isolation to hope and the decision to share her work.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery of the lens, bread initials, and rosewater dread layer toward a final image of Maren carrying the beekeeper's loaf toward the thaw. However, the closure effect (Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing) remains largely asserted rather than dramatized—"whatever came next" gestures at stakes but does not land a visible or felt cost on the page. The thaw complicates but does not decisively narrow options or force a trade-off with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: counter-clockwise imagery, the hunger stone, and latent radiance layer toward a final image of dissolution. However, the closure—lighthouse dissolving into light, Iris "stepping beyond fate's reach"—offers Conceptual Repricing without a legible on-page cost; the "bleak exhilaration" is asserted rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or consequence. The piece teaches its pattern but the Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence makes the price unmistakable at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the funhouse visit accumulates symbolic weight through mirrors, clasp, photograph, culminating in the confession that releases the curse. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the photograph returns to normal, the advisor fades, Clara drives forward)—cost is implied in "tired, marked by what she had survived" but remains conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that narrows options. The orientation is present (Clara at carnival gates, post-resuscitation timeframe) though "the night after Clara washed ashore from the dark reservoir" mixes metaphor with literal action, causing brief ambiguity. One meaningful deepening occurs when Clara unbosoms herself, but the escalation is more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit is present. The piece describes a repeated ritual (striking water, reading clouds) without a before/after change, decision, or reweighted cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when clear early), but the dominant lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pressure builds to a turn. The ending ("smiled in the gathering darkness") restates the opening's serene mastery without cost or reconfiguration. Applying −0.5 for lens ambiguity and −0.8 for absent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered world detail, the watchers' presence, and Mira's pattern-reading until the whistle sequence shifts cadence and ignites the spiral glow. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the turtles stir, options crystallize—but the cost remains more atmospheric promise than legible on-page forfeiture. The structure is single-POV, one continuous scene, with minimal transition debt; escalation tightens through the question embedded in the spirals and the whistle's three-tone signal. One meaningful deepening is present, though the final image charges expectation more than it reconfigures prior stakes with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in pure reflection mode with no present-tense dramatic action beyond holding a letter. Orientation is delayed: we learn location and physical anchors late, and the "three days ago" petal provides no live clock pressure. Closure reads as a thematic declaration ("she would publish") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The Drive Lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the ending—only summary of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean within 120 words (Maren, shore mapping, dusk, pavilion). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through object discovery, note-placing ritual, and the final image of carrying the story "like a letter never sent." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final paragraph crystallizes her new role with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (leaving the provincial job implied). One meaningful deepening: the inkwell inscription shifts her from observer to custodian, reweighting her entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (library, blackout, Mira's role). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (resolve crystallization/Charged Poise) where Mira commits to preserving marginalia truths, but the cost remains conceptual and slightly diffuse—"adding her own annotations" implies future action rather than an on-page forfeiture or pivot that narrows present options. One meaningful deepening (discovery of hidden archive) tightens her understanding, satisfying the lens, though the final image could land harder with a single enacted micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates grief-work particulars (gem polishing, crane folding, dream playback) and the final image reweights the opening frame: building containers becomes the method of living after loss. Orientation anchors (floating island tea garden, Mira, twilight, eighteen months post-shadow) arrive clearly within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's choice to fold another crane after watching the dream consolidates her new craft as the response to unbearable loss, and the conceptual cost—living by memorializing—is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dream plays and she continues folding, cementing repetition as survival. The lens holds and the cost is felt, though a sharper trade-off or foreclosed option would lift this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is anchored early (floating observatory, wedding survivor, watching circuit breakers cool) and sustains an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through looped meditation on unused potential, with the geode as a recurring image. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final sentence reweights the hunt itself as the only possible stance, with cost visible in "the hunt that will never end but must continue anyway." The cost is conceptual and existential rather than a decisive action, which fits the lens. Minor causality slips (the geode "grows warm" without clear trigger; the "particular purple of a sun that set years ago" introduces temporal confusion) and the lack of a sharp turn or tightening beyond accumulation keep this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when by the opening paragraphs) and holds a hybrid lens tilting accumulative-textural, with the observatory mechanism serving as the causal-textural pivot. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): Mira's realization reweights the "frequency of belonging" premise with a felt shift in understanding. However, the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than concretely legible on the page—no visible forfeiture or trade-off in the final image beyond the affirmation itself, which lowers the felt price. The lens holds, but the closure's cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but wobbles: the driftwood carvings pattern promises accumulation, yet the closure pivots to a single causal reveal (the watch hand) that contradicts the established method. Orientation anchors emerge slowly—who/where/when coalesce only after the opening paragraph, and the "forgotten shore" remains spatially vague throughout. The watch-hand reveal delivers a decisive change in knowledge, but cost is told ("weight of a withheld truth") rather than shown through a choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. No on-page action or micro-choice follows the recognition; the ending summarizes survival rather than staging it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the dual release of the brass pulls reweights inherited guilt with felt cost. The orientation anchors (parapet, mist, two characters) arrive cleanly within the opening. Causality is present but soft: the decision to drop the pull feels thematically motivated rather than forced by prior pressure or a reversal that narrows options. The ending supplies visible symbolic action and a mood shift, meeting the RR standard, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara continues paddling despite broken vision, forecloses withdrawal, and discovers a new navigation method with felt cost (loss of celestial mastery, reliance on humble poles). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through reflection interleaved with present action, culminating in the laugh and course correction that reweights her expectations. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she gravitates toward the poles and realizes she's "aligning heart and action," then the current catches her and she laughs—a micro turn that charges the ending without requiring a second decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words (Vera, clinic, industrial sector), waiving the Q2 penalty. The piece reads under a Hybrid lens: early moves are causal (procedure→empty house feeling, clippings→underground entrance), but the ending shifts to Accumulative/Textural mode with a lyric reweighting. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the "jaded wonder" synthesis and empathy kindling), yet cost remains asserted rather than shown—no choice, forfeiture, or on-page price visible in the final image. The traveler's arrival and Vera's realization feel coincidental; the ending reconfigures meaning but lacks the decisive narrowing or felt consequence required for higher bands. One meaningful deepening (underground journey→final chamber) is present but the cost proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lysara completes her metamorphosis and senses Korin's presence—but the cost is asserted ("becoming something other than fully human") rather than dramatized in a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The spice ritual and phoenix backstory provide texture, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; she proceeds steadily from intent to completion without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance/release) as closure. The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing—"some debts are paid not by accumulation but by acceptance"—that reweights the opening quest, and the cost is legible in the blood/ink mingling and the shift from grasping to releasing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost, though the causal chain from "find lost time" to "cut palm" involves a leap that slightly softens the inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who and where by ~120 words and establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Seraph's stitching work gathers pressure through density and pattern. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she completes the web, the dimension opens, and she steps through carrying the integrated past. Cost is legible in the phrase "all that shadow finally integrated into light" and the years of solitary work, though the final step itself feels more fulfillment than sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the shadow work began at the last human's death.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece anchors who and where early, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, closure reads as a thematic declaration ("she had become transformation") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material through image or action. The eclipse and jar-opening create atmospheric texture but no causal turn that narrows options or alters knowledge. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image summarizes rather than recharges, and no on-page cost is legible in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a causal lens: blackout → investigation → discovery → decision to act. Closure arrives as a Decisive Change (Elara will transmit the first message by dawn), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page relationship severed, no visible price paid, no tactical dilemma that narrows her options in the final image. The orientation anchors (Elara, fort courtyard, twilight blackout) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quill holder clicks open, but the revolution's implications never test Elara's commitment with a felt sacrifice before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. The story coheres around Mira's nightly ritual, the Spiral of Catching Hold sequence escalating to a decisive breakthrough where she understands connection versus capture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the eels rise, transfer "starlight and memory," and the vision transforms from cursed unchangeability to spreading borrowed dawn—the promise shifts from weight to wing with legible conceptual cost (all remaining star dust spent, old paradigm renounced). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs on-page when the sequence works and Mira steps onto the rocks, altering her stance with felt finality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Charged Poise variant) where Mira's vigil crystallizes into understanding that she held herself in pause. Orientation is clear early (observatory, storm, three years censored). The closure unit lands on the page with her writing in mist, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no material sacrifice shown. The realization that "she had been the one holding it in suspension" functions more as insight than transformation with stakes. Under an Accumulative lens the pattern deepens, but the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp edge of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored by ~120 words (Varn, glass atrium, afternoon), but the narrative immediately switches to backstory about the mechanical arm without dramatizing the present confrontation. The closure unit—Varn's "breakthrough" via "superior understanding"—occurs off-page as summary: "he saw an opening... and with a precise movement that spoke volumes, he turned the younger scholar's momentum back upon itself." No decisive action or felt cost is legible; the scholar's "defeat" is abstract ("not in his body but in his certainty"). Lens ambiguity: the piece oscillates between causal (physical duel), accumulative (philosophical reflection), and situational (waiting), but the ending relies on assertion rather than dramatized transformation. Apply −0.4 for lens ambiguity and −0.5 for closure by summary rather than on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through shared confessions and collaborative acts (organizing books, writing poems, creating signs) that reweight the evening from a job into "something small but whole." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the warden's interruption at 2 a.m. crystallizes the cathedral they've built, and Mira pockets the tin "feeling the weight of everything she had given and everything she had received"—a legible reweighting with felt cost (exposure, time, emotional labor). The piece holds its lens cleanly. The orientation is swift (prison library, Mira, coffee tin, vagrant poet status all anchored in paragraph one), and the single-scene window with clear time markers (hour of silence, moon rise, midnight, 2 a.m.) maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early (station pianist, evening, three years post-loss). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the arbor visit deepens the ritual of mourning, and the final playing reweights the dominant stake (honoring Clara's request). However, the closure lacks visible cost—playing the piece is described as defiance of fate, but no on-page consequence or foreclosed path is legible. The "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" framing promises agency but delivers a wistful performance in a private space where no tangible stakes shift. The film-reel mechanism and compass flicker are set up but never constrain a choice or create friction; they function as passageways, not pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds through the journey and culminates in a dream-vision that reweights the stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—Mira understands that memory is scattered, not preserved in a vessel—but the cost is told rather than shown. The orientation test passes (who/where/when by paragraph one), and the pattern holds, yet the final image ("empirical whimsy…sufficient") abstracts the realization rather than grounding it in a concrete consequence or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: grief-charged objects (compass, lace, bonsai) accumulate meaning until the final pruning gesture reconfigures Marek's stance from seeking an answer to accepting openness. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + shift toward light); the cost is the relinquishment of needing Elias's return or a definitive answer. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (who, where, when), and the dominant stake—finding peace with unspoken apologies—tightens through study, realization, and final action. One minor slip: the compass "pointing... toward the center of his own chest" feels slightly on-the-nose, diluting the image's subtlety.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the final image of dust patterns reweights her understanding of endings with felt cost—the liberation from needing significance—anchored in the on-page realization "both the supernova and the butterfly were simply ways that matter rearranged itself."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of her walking east, guided by frost patterns, reconfigures her from victim to pursuer with undeniable pressure. The cost is legible in the "loosening of grief" and the relinquishment of passive sanctuary. The frost-pattern discovery acts as a meaningful tightening, and the lens holds coherently from the patterned opening to the patterned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in accepting new senses. Orientation clear early, structure coherent for single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with decisive change from weariness to readiness, charged by the lens repairing as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with cost under an accumulative/textural lens; the bell ringing reconfigures community hope into intergenerational support with persistent constraints from sanctions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds throughout, leading to a charged poise where the final image reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change under a causal lens, and orientation is immediate. The cost, however, is more atmospheric than personally felt by Mei, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via Elara's realization and commitment, cost legible in the imperative to stop disintegration; orientation anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is tight; orientation immediate; closure is a charged poise with palpable cost—the waiting, the risk—and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) as Elara realizes trust breaking is a symphony of silences, with cost felt in her loss and continued work.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with the fleeting light and empty jar providing subtle cost. Orientation is clear, but causality between Mira's act and the man's shift remains ambiguous, slightly weakening the linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (internal thawing) with felt cost on-page; orientation clear early; persistent constraint of thawing heart shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (rejection of Daniel’s control) with felt cost (“trembling certainty”). The seashell and cast provide coherent because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost (her eyes closing as light fades, her life given). The persistent constraint of the dying star and storm shapes tactics, and the final image reconfigures meaning—the map is to be inhabited, not feared.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (accepting the flow of perceptions as self) with undeniable conceptual cost on page ("shattered the illusion of continuous identity"). Orientation clear early; looped timeline pattern taught and paid off at closure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens held; orientation clear. Closure is a charged poise with cost legible in "lens felt suddenly heavier" and the final image of drawing; persistent constraint of unreliable words shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens held; orientation clear early. Closure is a Charged Poise where the return of marbles to pocket reconfigures options with cost legible in "every crack a lesson mended into understanding." Persistent constraint of marbles shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with conceptual cost as Kira proves time moves sideways, reshaping research. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to confirmation, and twilight convergence provides persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and cost legible in the rising water; the hybrid lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Mira, having internalized forgiveness, stands ready at her post; cost is legible in the lightened heart that carries the weight of past error.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clear Decisive Change (Marcus confesses) with felt cost, landing on the page in the final lines. The inferred Causal lens holds: his exploration leads to the ghost shift, which triggers the radio and the wheel's turn, compelling his speech. Orientation is anchored early (<120 words). The ghost shift concept is taught and pays off, creating a coherent "because/therefore" linkage that tightens to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with implied conceptual cost; accumulative lens holds, but cost lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: pressure builds via the eclipse's progression and sensory density toward a Charged Poise closure (Maya's touch). Orientation is immediate, and the closure lands on-page with a felt cost—the ephemeral, solidified memory. One meaningful tightening (totality to reemergence) is sufficient and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the realization that stories may spin a new axis reweights the premise with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds tightly, and orientation is immediate and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure via Charged Poise as Elias understands his role, with cost legible in his sealed response and the arrivals; orientation clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: pressure builds through layered repetition (chant, color, silence) toward a Charged Poise closure—Matthias entering the threshold. Orientation is immediate and clear. The persistent constraint of the dimensional anchor and the live clock (11:47) shape tactics. Cost is legible in the "frustration" of the stalled possession and the "brighter and more terrible" unraveling of stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost in the spire dissolving and her strength fading. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the deadline of dawn providing persistent constraint. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure is coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira accepts control; the accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and memory shards; cost is legible in the "shadowed corridors" and the final image of the ripple she will now direct.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Inferred lens: Causal. Closure is a decisive change (conceptual repricing of silence) with clear, felt cost on the page: "she would never hear the way she once had, but she had found something more valuable." Orientation is immediate, causality tight (deafness leads to cavern, backward songs enable felt experience), and the single-scene structure with one transition is perfectly scaled. The constraint of deafness shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.5)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure (greenhouse aftermath → butterfly death → three-days-later dust pattern) is clear and coherent, with each beat deepening the central question about endings. Causality is modest but present: the storm/flood leads to the greenhouse wreckage and the butterfly encounter, which triggers reflection that’s reweighted by the later dust spread. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of violent vs gradual change with a legible before/after. There are no orientation issues, and the quiet arc fits the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine—fire and attempted murder → hiding in canyon → discovering frost patterns as maps → reconceiving the ledger and choosing to hunt the smugglers—is clean and coherent. The piece leans accumulative/lyric, but the closure is still a clear Decisive Change in stance with conceptual repricing of the ledger. Reflection about the fire and her art is well anchored in present stimuli (frost, canyon, stars) and doesn’t muddle the timeline. Stakes are modestly scaled but structurally sound for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: prior mapping leads to the avoided hall, and entering that charged space produces a meaningful reweighting of her work. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and the movement from outer conservatory to inner hall is clear. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what she thought was preparatory work is revealed as already having “translated” silence, and the final stance (“began her work in earnest”) marks a legible before/after. Stakes are mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through hard choices, which keeps this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: package → lens → portal → soul work → new vocation, with one elegant scene break into the underwater library. Closure is solid, with a clear before/after in his purpose and the lens’s function, and the story sustains one dominant drive. The cost of this shift (what he gives up in returning to a life that will now be interrupted by calls) is only lightly implied, so the ending feels more comfortably resolved than deeply paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: backstory (border crossing, sanctions, food runs) leads naturally into the present-night decision to ring the bell and reveal the mentorship plan. Orientation is strong and early—who Mira is, where they are, and what the sanctions mean are clear, and the arbor provides a coherent focal location for closure. The closure itself is a resonant reconfiguration, shifting from isolated, anonymous care to collective, intergenerational linkage under a shared symbol. That said, there’s minimal plotted resistance or complication in the present scene, so the climactic moment reads more as a planned unveiling than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: past-life surfacing → journey to liminal site → breathing-triggered revelation of unused love → ritualized capture and release. Causality holds under a textural lens, with the Kwan Yin’s tear and Mei’s practice coherently explaining why she’s the one who can act here. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—unused love is reconceived as locational residue that can be translated and released—with a felt if quiet cost in her labor of mourning/acceptance. The piece remains a bit frictionless, but not structurally confused.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: discovery of the halo fragment, revelation of the photographs’ behavior, re-interpretation of the garden, and the climactic choice to complete the circuit form a clear escalating chain. Causality within this conceit is tight—the photographs are disintegrating because the temporal geometry is failing, compelling the maze solution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Elara reframes the garden and her role from passive inheritor to active designer of a time-texture machine. Stakes remain primarily conceptual and emotional rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: entrance to the redemption center → coded bench → opening the vault → articulated mission, with backstory interleaved through specific triggers. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens, and the ending offers a clear Charged Poise: she chooses to wait, preserving the seeds for a later, riskier dispersal. Still, key pressures (soldiers arriving, danger of discovery) remain entirely offstage, so the piece leans heavily on exposition about future plans instead of dramatizing a live turn or test in the present. The closure is conceptually strong but arrives without a decisive structural beat that materially changes her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous scene with interleaved reflection that steadily tightens around the question of what we hear when things end. Causality is clean—her method, the forge, and her memories of David all build toward the conceptual breakthrough about “a symphony of tiny silences.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes trust-breaking not as one event but as architectural erosion and decides to continue her work with this new understanding. Cost is implicit but clear in the image of a life’s research devoted to something that may never have practical payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear sequence (waiting → selection → magical act → man’s reaction → reflective close) and no causality breaks. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of watching, decoding, and revealing builds toward a charged final stance about listening to fate. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the man leaves slightly changed, Mira’s mission reaffirmed, the empty jar and full camera marking a before/after. The main limitation is that the stakes and turns remain gentle, so the structural arc feels more like a beautifully composed vignette than a truly pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure—one continuous scene braided with a compact backstory—holds cleanly, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the opening sentence. The throughline is essentially: he works, remembers, observes the thaw, and crystallizes a renewed, slightly braver stance toward vulnerability and inquiry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the bookmark and vessel juxtaposed and the thaw internalized, but the cost of this shift is more implied than sharply felt. The lack of a concrete external test or decisive turn limits structural punch at a high-literary bar.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: seashell revelation → flight to library → encounter with Daniel → decision to read the cast → internal reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as causal, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which she decisively rejects the identity Daniel scripted for her. The cost—accepting that her life has been constructed and that her protector is her captor—is on the page, though external consequences remain hazy (Daniel’s concrete leverage never quite crystallizes). Structure holds for the length, but a slightly clearer sense of what immediate danger she’s in would deepen the stakes of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—one continuous vigil interwoven with backstory—reads clean and coherent, with orientation (who/where/when) established early. The dominant drive is to complete the map before the last star dies; the pause in the storm and the final-page drawing are legible as the central tightening, and closure is a resonant earned stasis when she finishes and lets go. Cost (her life, the world transitioning into endless night) is on the page and conceptually clear. The piece is static in physical terms, but for a lyric, textural design the progression is adequate and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a single continuous scene in the courtyard, with backstory (Procedure, loops, Program) cleanly anchored and folded into the present via the violin. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure deepens from maintenance to experiment to insight, and the final realization about accepting flow provides a clear conceptual reconfiguration. Stakes and closure are legible, but the progression between beats is smooth rather than sharply segmented, giving the arc a gentle slope instead of a strong hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: quiet duty → recognition of Mira’s experiment → reciprocal ticket exchange → physical touch → arrival of new visitors and recommitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the registrar’s role shifts from passive custodian of a failed system to active participant in a new one, with the lens reweighted as a future tool. The cost—risking vulnerability after an era of mistrust—is present but underplayed, keeping the change more contemplative than charged. Causal logic is intact, but escalation leans heavily on mood rather than sharpened choices.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single present-moment walk framed by reflective blocks anchored in concrete action (the maze, the bench, the marbles). Causality is coherent, and the “mended deception” backstory is legible and neatly tied off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Elara pockets the nearly-complete collection and allows the maze to meet the approaching villager without intervention. Still, the decisive change is conceptual rather than situational and carries relatively low felt cost, which limits impact under a demanding standard.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: station warms → Kira prepares the nexus → twilight convergence → lever-driven realignment → observed temporal bleed → confirmed hypothesis → full-power climax and confirmation. Structure is a single continuous scene with a clear beginning (setup), middle (calibration and first anomalous reading), and end (full proof and recontextualization of Kira’s identity). Closure is solid conceptually—she crosses from speculation to documented fact with career-changing implications—but the cost is mostly implied (no on-page risk of failure or consequence if wrong). The drive lens is predominantly causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: flood backdrop → mysterious program and Marco’s death → revelation via water damage → piano performance → departure. Causality holds under an accumulative/magical-realist lens, and the closure—she has received the message and can now leave—is legible and satisfying. The “miraculously dry” piano is a mild convenience, but it fits the chosen mode rather than breaking logic. Escalation is modest yet coherent, with the rising water and progressive decoding giving a clear arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene from fever break through storm arrival, with the illustration touch as the hinge and the decision to send the warning as closure. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: data + memory + physical contact with the drawing lead to a reconfigured self-understanding and renewed agency. The cost—living with her fallibility while still forecasting—is legible in the final choice. The external plot stakes stay mostly implied (the valley’s danger is never concretely dramatized), which slightly limits the sense of structural urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from entry to encounter to realization and confession, with clear causal and accumulative links (forum tips → tunnel → valve wheel → ghost shift → radio chorus → confession). Closure lands via a charged poise/quiet DC: Marcus finally speaks the long-suppressed truth, reconfiguring the story’s premise about confession and belief. Stakes and cost are legible but largely internal, and the piece stops at the instant of speaking rather than showing any immediate aftermath. Still, the arc feels complete at this length with no major orientation or causality issues.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is legible and coherent: overgrown library → discovery/use of refuge via swan → established rhythm between the two spaces → closing stasis, with an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final paragraph crystallizes the keeper’s existence as an endless, charged equilibrium between decay and regenerative silence. However, the piece reads more as an extended vignette than a scene with a decisive shift; the discovery of the refuge is summarized as already past, so the before/after is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. The cost of this stasis (e.g., what’s foreclosed by endless witnessing) remains implied, not concretely sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous eclipse session that accumulates tension texturally until the shared silence at totality and Maya’s touch. The drive lens is primarily accumulative; the eclipse’s progression and the children’s attention gradually reweight Elara’s stake in creating a sustaining memory. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the keepsake curl is reinterpreted as honoring the future rather than clutching the past, with a quiet emotional cost in her awareness of the children’s “stormy life” ahead. The lack of overt external turns keeps this below the very top band but the closure is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present work in the silo, discovery of Miriam’s diary, linkage to the tapestry, then a conceptual revaluation of dreams as fuel and stories as residual power. Causality is coherent—Miriam’s entries lead to his realization, which reorients his project—so closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a discernible before/after in knowledge. However, the cost of this new understanding remains mostly conceptual, and no concrete options are sharply narrowed on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, but the closing beat could tighten stakes or consequence more.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from present routine to reflective espionage parallels, then to the letter as a tightening turn, and finally to the arrivals as closure. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear very early, and the lighthouse-isolation frame never wavers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his refusal/deferral of return and the sense that his “orchestration” has begun to pull others to him. The main limitation is that causal linkage is often thematic rather than dramatized; the stakes and consequences of the letter response remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene accumulating toward a charged entrance into the vestry, with clear anchors in time (11:47 before midnight) and place (St. Bartholomew’s as a dimensional anchor). The closure functions as Charged Poise: he steps into the threshold with his method and tools prepared, and the before/after is legible conceptually. That said, the piece reads strongly as prologue—the actual confrontation is deferred—so the sense of on-page cost at the ending remains more implied than felt, keeping the structural impact below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: summoned by the council, last night in the spire, build toward dawn and the writing of the fortune, dissolution into light. Causality is simple but coherent and the closure—a final fortune written at the edge of her cognitive collapse—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the mirrored horizon motif ties beginning and ending. The main limitation is that the “before exhaustion hits” clock is more declared than dramatized in scenes or decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one accumulative scene on the viaduct as she passes through fractures, moving deeper into her own history. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: tablet → fractures → progressively deeper self-confrontation → final stance that she will be the one to drop the stone. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: her relationship to the ripples of time and self shifts from victim to agent with a conceptual cost. The piece could gain from one more concrete, scene-level turn, but as a lyric design it holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: journey → presentation of the phonograph → progressive deepening with the backward songs → reconfigured understanding at exit. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens: each recording incrementally alters Maren’s relationship to silence until the conceptual shift at the end. Closure is clear and on-page—she will remain deaf, but her options and self-conception have changed at a cost. The piece skews low on external complication, but for this mode the single continuous scene and one major interior turn are sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—being followed, receiving Marques’s message, realizing the dumping scheme, grasping her own role via the data, and deciding to send evidence—is clear and cleanly sequenced. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and never wavers, and the backstory is well anchored in present actions. Closure is a genuine Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena shifts from observer to active whistleblower with an implied cost to her safety. The only limitation is that the cost and narrowing of options remain somewhat conceptual rather than tested in a concrete, escalating on-page beat.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from routine (evening light) to experiment (opening the vial) to revelation and revaluation (understanding the flower as a vessel of grief). Causality is tight under a largely accumulative/textural lens: perfume → bloom → ultraviolet revelation → emotional and conceptual shift. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing—extinction and grief are reweighted, and her stance toward both her brother’s work and her own caution changes with visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that the conflict’s stakes remain mostly interior and reflective, so the “clock” of fading light never quite becomes an urgent structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative/situational: one continuous scene with reflection interleaved, building toward the crystallized choice. Causality holds—past events (capture, escape, invitation from the beings) logically shape the current dilemma—and the rope’s luminescence plus the starlight “heartbeat” mark the tightening and closure. The ending functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses a path (joining now) to inhabit the threshold with awareness of the cost. There are no orientation issues, though the stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene from arrival through deliberate musical attempt to a modest but real shift in the world’s “breath.” Orientation in who/where/when is early and strong, and the accumulative/textural drive (music vs. hush) holds consistently. The closure beat—hearing “the soft, unsteady rhythm of the world beginning to breathe again”—functions as a resonant reconfiguration with cost, not a reset. The only limiting factor is that the path from first note to world-response is almost frictionless; a slightly knottier progression of attempts or setbacks would deepen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, causal flow from waiting → checking the blotter → inhaling → insight, ending in a resonant reconfiguration (reframing half truths as whole lies and returning to the work). Under an accumulative/textural lens the escalation of sensory and conceptual density works, but the global drive remains fairly low-pressure and almost entirely internal. Closure lands conceptually but the “before/after” is modest: she already lives by useful fictions, and the new insight mainly polishes that stance rather than truly foreclosing an option. Causality never breaks, yet the absence of a sharper pivot or external test keeps this just below elite-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: symphony → wandering → library → envelope → Elias → conversation → reoriented outlook. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Maren leaves with a changed conceptual map of the world and an intention to act differently. Structure stays tight and linear with one temporal transition and no orientation issues. The stakes remain modest and there is little sense that alternatives would have carried real cost, which keeps the plot from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival/orientation in the orchard, setup via Corwin, descent to the arbor, revelation, then decision and return, with clear causal links. The closure functions as a decisive internal change (choosing to stay and participate differently) with a felt cost of vulnerability and effort. The Threader-twist (the artist as practice) reconfigures the premise without breaking logic, and the spirals on the path give a concrete final cadence. Escalation is mostly internal and could feel sharper or more pressured, but it still coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation, causal throughline, and closure are all clear: she detects a pattern, follows a specific lead from her grandmother, reaches the chamber, and restores the echoes via a concrete action. The structure is cleanly linear under a causal lens, and the final state of the city’s rhythm is decisively changed on-page. The cost of borrowing time, though suggested conceptually (risking the founder’s nap/timeflow), never tightens into a present-tense threat or complication, so the climax lacks friction. As a result, the resolution feels somewhat too smooth for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: arrival → recollection of the eyes’ origin → experimental use → relinquishment and reframed understanding. Causality is coherent (her stated goal leads to the experiment with the eyes, which leads to the offering and stance shift), and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a solve. The cost—spending her last meaningful currency and choosing acceptance over solution—is legible on the page. The piece stays mostly textural, so stakes remain relatively low-intensity, but for this quiet mode the closure lands with satisfying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from routine inspection to discovery of the tape to a conceptual reconfiguration of what Maren’s work can mean, with a resonant final image of the student above. Causality is intact and orientation is clear from the outset; the outage and the pipe chases frame everything. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “visibility” rather than a decisive change in circumstance, which suits the piece but keeps the stakes relatively soft. No major turns misfire, but escalation is modest and largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present scene with interleaved backstory and a clear before/after centered on whether Vera will keep using plants as a buffer against change. The agricultural grant and the doctor’s diagnosis deepen pressure rather than fragment it, and the closure lands when she reframes her life through the caterpillar story and reaches out to Sarah. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pattern and image (leaf, trellis, vines, storms) reweighted at the end. Cost is legible in her surrender of control and her tacit acceptance that metamorphosis may entail loss.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clean: reading the rain → following the trails → reaching the island ruins → meeting the stranger → exchanging brooch for telescope → finally being able to sleep. The piece adheres to a single-scene structure with no orientation issues and a clear build to closure. Closure (her finally sleeping after nineteen days, post-exchange) lands as a decisive change with a visible price (relinquishing the brooch, enduring the journey). The only limitation is that the intermediary turns are gentle; no structural beat feels surprising or particularly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is simple but effective: pilgrimage → discovery of the cave’s nature → destabilization of his gift → conceptual reframing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, details of the cave’s sentience and music build toward the realization that the future is a “garden,” delivering a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is coherent at this quiet scale—no orientation issues, and the vision-coordinates → journey → stay → changed exit chain holds. The main limitation is a lack of on-page turning points or concrete dilemmas; the nine-day stay is glossed rather than broken into structural beats that escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: harbor → exiles arrive → Sera’s visit and object-reading → reactivation of the valve’s meaning. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: he reinterprets the valve from relic to promise, reweighting his life’s work. Causality is modest but coherent; each beat follows naturally from the last with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the “cost” of this realization remains mostly conceptual, so the before/after line is more reflective than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: dare → following the cracks → arrival at the station → activation of the punch → spoken confession, with a clear before/after in Aria’s relationship to her silence. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression from streets to fortress to perforated truth feels coherent and the closure lands on the page with a visible emotional cost. Causality is mythic but legible (the cracks guide, the tool releases truth), with no major orientation issues. The main limitation is that several devices (arrows, fortress, punch) appear fully cooperative, so obstacles or complicating turns are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: orientation is swift, the loose stone and tile serve as a strong inciting incident, and the night of transcription accumulates pressure toward a conceptual revaluation. Causality is more accumulative than plotty, but each step (discover tile → transcribe → memories flood → realization of communal archive → voluntary contribution) follows a clear because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her mission’s purpose is redefined and her stance toward the world changes with an implied cost. The scope is appropriate for the length, with no dangling setups or confusing ellipses.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: set-up of immortal + amulet + long wait, arrival and intensification of solar storm, space tearing, and a single culminating revelation. Causality is solid and easy to follow, and the closure functions as a clear conceptual repricing of “goodbye” under an accumulative/lyric lens. The price is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized—no alternative path is visibly foreclosed in scene—so the ending, while coherent, lacks a sharper sense of cost. Still, the before/after in his understanding is unmistakable and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ink → job with the dead → Darius’s breach → decision to write differently → off-page decision → approval and reconfiguration. The time jump of “Three weeks later” is efficient and the closure (her equation found, stance clarified) is legible. However, the asylum decision arrives without any on-page complication beyond initial rejection, so the structural arc feels a bit too smooth and inevitable for the stakes named. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a hard Decisive Change, which fits but slightly lowers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is clear and coherent in an accumulative/lyric mode, with the “changed hum” as the closest thing to an inciting shift. Yet the story offers more premise-establishing than movement: the new frequency is recorded, but no option or understanding truly reconfigures by the end. Closure is a soft Charged Poise at best—the final prism image heightens intent but does not mark a decisive before/after with cost. It feels like the opening scene of a longer work rather than a self-contained piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: daily routine → backstory of the death certificate → discovery of the label → dockworker’s anecdote → reconfigured understanding and renewed commitment. Causality is clean (the unusual tide exposes the label, which triggers the dockworker’s story and the protagonist’s reframed stance), and orientation in time/place is solid from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the label is reweighted from relic of suicide to emblem of survival and the nameless one’s practice is framed as a counter-history with real conceptual cost. Stakes stay mostly conceptual, but the before/after in how the nameless one understands their work is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival, discovery, inciting hum/vision, reframing of the investigation, and a quiet conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is straightforward (touching the cello triggers visions; visions reframe her sense of mystery), and the accumulative lens holds. However, the middle “loop” of her repeated use of the cello is mostly summarized rather than shown, so the escalation between first hum and final stance feels more told than experienced. Closure is present and coherent but could land harder with one more concrete, dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal line (investors arrive → Mira observes and infers threat → she decides to resurrect the code → she executes the graffiti network → community will be ready tomorrow) with good orientation in time and space. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of a “living network, reorganized and ready” marks a clear before/after in options. Still, the main conflict—developers vs. community—has not yet met direct resistance on the page, so the ending leans on promised future confrontation rather than a cost-bearing turn within this scene. As a result, the structural arc feels more preparatory than fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a ticking clock (forty minutes to lunar dawn) and a clear before/after anchored on the moment of first sunlight. The accumulative drive—preparation, reflection, then the exposure itself—builds toward a quiet but legible closure in which the mission is completed and reweighted as an act of witness. Causality is intact and orientation is excellent; every beat follows logically from the premise. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but the final reconfiguration around loss vs endurance lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: a damaged drone must be repaired before the ship departs, which leads directly to the final release. The structure is linear and coherent, with good early anchoring of who/where/when and a clear deadline. Closure lands via a modest but satisfying Decisive Change (the drone leaves repaired, connection restored), though the cost is relatively soft and the deadline never fully tightens into real jeopardy. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a light textural overlay, and that choice holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: long study → falcon dispatched → falcon returns with clue → symbol decoded as “origin,” leading to a charged poise ending where discovery feels imminent. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with present action anchored early and backstory woven in through clearly cued reflections. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she moves from doubt/contested theory to near-certainty), but the cost is only lightly implied rather than felt. Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation is modest but coherent, so the piece reads complete though not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure—repeated circuits through the town, slowly building resonance—fits the premise and is easy to follow, with a clean single-POV window. Causality is simple but coherent: town silence → elders’ charge → Eliorn’s methodical walking and tuning → first hum → charged near-completion. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the archway hums, the town begins to wake, and she commits to finishing the last “two thousand footsteps.” The main limitation is that the cost and risk of failure at this late stage could be dramatized more sharply to heighten the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is cleanly causal: inheritance of the vial and warning → deliberate descent despite danger → opening the vial → vision-flood → locating and unsnarling the mechanism → becoming the vessel. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid almost immediately, and the underwater temple frame holds throughout under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—Marina’s ontology reconfigured into the temple’s keeper—with a clear cost (loss of individual future) and gain (preservation of a civilization). The only limit is that the world-level implications remain abstract, keeping the plot’s consequences more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival at the railing → approach to the door → entry and kneeling → charged final stance before the village’s future return. Causality is soft but present under a textural lens, and closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis where Marcus fixes his role before the bodies are found. The temporal and spatial anchors (lighthouse prison, impending discovery of the bodies) are clear and stable, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the haunting routine, the backstory of the debt, and the present encounter with the gardener align toward the mantle-passing moment. Causality holds—Elara’s repeated service leads to this greenhouse, her intervention sparks the scions’ sudden growth, and that enables the transfer of curse/blessing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the debt measurably shifts, Elara is “nearly finished,” and the gardener’s role and cost are established. The piece is more textural than plot-twisty, but within that lens, the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: backstory and world-building feed into a single present drive—reaching and transforming the spring. Causality under a textural lens holds: her inherited lore → wandering → discovery of springs → decision to stitch a sacred path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the spring is marked and her long wandering resolves into purpose, with a clear before/after for the canyon community. The main limitation is the near-total absence of obstacles or turns in the present-time walk, which keeps the arc feeling more elegiac than dynamically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—present excavation interwoven with family history—holds together cleanly under a textural/lyric lens. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/why are quickly established) and the throughline from entering the abandoned wing to restoring the sundial and returning it aboveground is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: placing the gnomon and imagining future pilgrims conceptually reweights the catacomb orchard and her journey. The main limitation is that major turns are more implied than dramatized; there’s little sense of contingency or genuine risk around her choices, so the structural arc feels gently arched rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—one continuous pre-dawn window with interleaved reflection—is clean and easy to follow, with strong temporal anchoring and no causality breaks. The piece does reach a modest closure when Maren decides on the postscript and commits to mailing the letter, but the promised “letter that would change everything” remains abstract. The closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a Decisive Change, with cost more implied than felt. Overall, it’s structurally sound but not yet at a “must-publish” level of narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clear: a single, continuous scene that moves from work-in-progress to heightened awareness of an imminent coup and a renewed commitment to act through stitching possibilities. Causality is modest but coherent: synchronizing with the flame enables her to interpret the charts, which in turn crystallizes her reading of the coming violence and her method of resistance. The closure functions as a quiet Charged Poise—she commits to weaving stories that will outlast the conspirators—but the felt cost and narrowing of options are only lightly implied. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a clean, if understated, cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and coherent: arrival at the swamp → encounter with the window/message → decision to use the shard and evoke memory → internal reconfiguration and release. Causality under an accumulative lens is solid: each new element (mangrove rules, condensation text, shard warming) heightens the same central pressure rather than scattering it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Maren’s stance toward her past reweights everything—but the cost (she cannot undo the sister’s death) is only briefly touched, so the final shift edges toward tidy. A clearer on-page sense of what this new stance will cost or change in her ongoing life would deepen the before/after line.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Dr. Okonkwo’s request leads to the translation sequence, which culminates in connection with Fatima and the grandmother, then resolves in Elira’s reflective choice about the cast. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens—the pressure is in what’s revealed, not in physical jeopardy—and the closure (Elira deciding to return the cast, holding the coral) reconfigures the frame from medical scene to shared memorial. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) with no temporal or spatial stumbles. The only limit is that the global drive remains fairly low-key, with no major structural surprise or turn beyond the expected revelation and emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → setup → activation of the fragment → communal witnessing → quiet comedown, all under a single POV and scene. Causality is simple but solid (word from the knowledge network brings her back; the fragment plus projector produce the event; the event draws the people). Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira and the district both briefly remember joy, and the fragment’s darkening marks cost. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with no orientation problems or late-breaking rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery of place → discovery of coin → altered acoustics → realization and redefinition of her work, all in a single continuous scene. The drive reads as largely accumulative/textural, with each new detail of sound and pattern tightening the conceptual stakes. Closure is present in the reconfigured understanding of restoration as “completing a conversation,” but the cost of this shift is only lightly implied. All set-ups (garden design, coin, echoes) pay off, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored in the garden, cued by Elder Okonkwo’s prior charge, progressing through the planting to the drone pass and quiet closure. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative/textural lens, with the act of planting leading naturally to the charged final image of the root finding the “water table of rebellion.” Closure functions as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the world is reweighted by the seed’s presence rather than any overt event. Still, the lack of an on-page complication or turn during the planting makes the arc feel more like a beautifully rendered vignette than a fully pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: we move from premise → method of dispersal → history of the promise → deepening of longing → tremor of potential response → renewed effort. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid in the final image of her continuing to write as the postcard trembles, with cost implicit in the “longest wait.” There are no orientation issues; the shell, garret, postcard, and wind form a stable frame. The main limitation is that pressure rises gently rather than sharply, which keeps the structural impact strong but not extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one night’s rounds, object in hand, and a return to rest that lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a plotted turn. Causality is simple but intact—her use of the cracked chime to harvest names builds toward the closing image of ongoing duty with clear conceptual cost. There is no real escalation beyond deepening description, so the narrative reads more as a lyric meditation than a scene under tightening pressure. Still, the closure beat (returning the chime, re-committing to the work) clearly defines a before/after stance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with integrated backstory reflection, oriented early to who/where/what she’s doing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each paragraph thickens the pressure around decoding the final passage and the relational risk with Elian. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she finishes the prophecy, Elian enters, and their dynamic is reconfigured with a felt before/after in the silence between them. The cost remains largely conceptual/emotional (risking their fragile, broken trust) rather than dramatized consequences, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival with the chain and envelope, analysis via spectroscope, realization of the father’s encoded love and sacrifice, and a closing stance shift toward continuing his work. Causality is coherent and easy to track, with the envelope’s adhesive driving the central discovery. The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens, but there is still a clear before/after in Elara’s understanding and intent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, with a legible emotional cost in her acceptance and renewed responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: present-tense attic work interwoven with family and project history, all converging on the decision to play the meteorite and hear the lullaby. Orientation is clean from the opening paragraph, and the Echo Project threads through the middle to set up the closure. The ending is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, where “messages that might never arrive” are reweighted by the recovered song and the practice of trust. The drive is quiet and internal, so escalation feels more like deepening than narrowing, which slightly limits impact at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural drive: noticing the terrace, interpreting grain, recognizing the drift/flight-path link, then crossing to the village, with each realization reweighting the central “threshold” stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boundary is reconceived as doorway, and the reunion plus compass image mark an unmistakable before/after. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent (terrace drift tied to codes; codes tied to mother’s intent), though the emotional and practical costs of the journey are relatively lightly sketched, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: Marek arrives, explores, finds the archives, stages his own contribution, and witnesses the fireflies, with the facility’s imminent flooding providing a soft clock. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his understanding of belonging shifts from calculable pattern to shared breath, and the before/after is legible. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong, though the limit of “until sunrise” doesn’t produce an on-page turning choice. The cost is felt conceptually more than dramatically, but it’s present and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: a single, continuous scene that moves cleanly from setup to ritual to revelation to reconfiguration. Causality is clear—fisher brings seeds → Maren performs reading → discovers gap → chooses how to interpret and communicate it. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the father’s grief shifts from presumed death to painful, open-ended continuation with cost intact. Nothing crucial is elided or patched in retrospect, and orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is cleanly linear: setup of the tools and method, execution of the performance, and a quiet wrap as he pockets the bishop and thinks of tomorrow. As an accumulative/textural piece, it does achieve a modest Resonant Reconfiguration—our understanding of his “magic” as pure calculation is crystallized at the end. Still, the global drive remains low-pressure; there’s no decisive change in his options or circumstances, and the conceptual “cost” of his stance is only faintly implied. The result feels complete but slight in terms of narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric drive: present-moment ritual layered with past exile and the nostalgia ban, culminating in a conceptual repricing of exile and anchoring. Who/where/when are clear early, and there’s a single coherent scene with one dominant through-line (performing the verse). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the “anchor within her dissolve[s] like salt in rain,” marking a before/after. The main limitation is that the cost of this shift is more implied than felt, as grief is explicitly absent and prior attachment to the old life remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece functions as a single, continuous dawn scene, cleanly oriented in place and time with a legible, quiet closure (she moves from contemplation back into her work, reweighted by the pond’s “lesson”). The drive lens is clearly accumulative/textural: images and reflections build rather than a causal plot unfolding. That said, there is only a very slight tightening—dawn and the boat engine cue the end of her liminal window, but they don’t force a new stance so much as gently affirm her existing one. Closure lands, yet without a strong sense of “before/after” cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene on the ridge, with reflection anchored to concrete cues (scars, box, fire line) and a clear closure where she recommits to her role. Under an accumulative/textural lens, details about the fire, Elena, and the annual ritual steadily reweight the central loss. Causality is simple but intact—past choice → current ritual → future teaching—without teleporting information or dropped setups. The main limitation is that escalation is gentle and linear, with no sharp structural turn beyond the final reaffirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural slice: one extended research session framed in a single setting with a stable goal. Causality is coherent but minimal; each paragraph adds another facet of the same activity rather than producing turns or narrowing options. Closure is a mild Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she prepares for “another session,” reaffirming purpose under rising tide, but the cost of this dedication remains mostly conceptual. Structurally sound and legible, but too static and low-pressure for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: entry → discovery of diaries → methodical decoding → revelation of Ashworth’s chart → reframed sense of legacy. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration of Mira’s burden and the building’s “dreams.” Stakes and cost remain conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive. Still, the narrative never loses orientation and arrives at a clear before/after in Mira’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in time and place, building from arrival to ritual to departure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the deepening of the song and the mirrors’ shifting images provide a gentle progression that culminates with the bells and her exit, a modest resonant reconfiguration. Causality is straightforward and intact—she sings, the mirrors respond, she leaves—and there are no orientation issues. The main limitation is a lack of on-page cost or meaningful narrowing of options at the end, which keeps the closure somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene from arrival to handshake, with clear spatial and temporal anchors and a legible arc from assembly, through ritual, to tentative accord. The drive lens reads as situational/accumulative—pressure comes from the meeting’s inherent stakes and the piling of grief rather than big reversals—and the closure (handshake + Maren’s internal repricing of peace/redemption) lands with cost and clarity. Causality is modest but coherent: Maren’s ritual and confession invite reciprocal vulnerability that makes the small agreement plausible. What keeps this shy of the highest band is the relative softness of the on-page turn; escalation is more implied than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: years of manipulations and sacrifice culminate in bringing the egg to this engineered sanctuary and releasing it. Structure is clean—a single continuous scene interwoven with backstory that is well anchored by present sensations (salt flat, thunder, container). Closure lands as a Charged Poise image: the egg alone on the flat, future uncertain but the before/after of her choice unmistakable and costly. The main limitation is that no on-page obstacle or reversal tests her resolve in the moment, so escalation feels more implied than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: night journey → ritual at the fountain → dawn recognition, all under a single POV with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Causality is simple but intact: because the palace drains people, she seeks the courtyard to harvest echoes, which culminates in her strengthened refusal of conformity. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes—but the cost remains mostly conceptual and understated, limiting impact at the very top end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean: walk to dome → plant stick → attempt reverse-telling → realization about incomplete stories → exit with a new stance. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of his art, and the image of the stick left behind seals the before/after. Causality is simple but coherent—argument with Mira → need to test narrative ethics → reverse-telling insight—and the cost (surrendering a conquering approach to story) is legible if mostly conceptual. The piece is quiet and reflective but lands a clear, earned reconfiguration by the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from preparation to disruption to rescue to quiet aftermath. Causality is solid—the gust destroys the lattice, endangers the monarch, and forces an improvised signal that resolves the immediate situation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarch departs and Elara recommits to her work with renewed meaning. Stakes are modestly scaled but coherent; nothing in the causality or orientation breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense ritual work is interwoven with concise backstory, building toward the completed rope and her decision to leave the sanctum. Causality is intact—finding the punched card leads to a new method, which leads to the glowing rope and the “living archive” closure image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctum’s function changes and her stance toward the world shifts, with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the decisive inner change (forgiveness) precedes the scene, so the climax feels like execution of a decision rather than a sharpened turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: entrance → ritual preparation → recitation → realization → transcendence, all in one continuous scene with clear orientation. Causality is mostly accumulative—actions build toward the bunker’s activation and her understanding of the directive. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (the directive as answers, not instructions) paired with transcendence, but the cost of that shift is only lightly implied. The external clock (storm, decay) is set up but never truly bites in a way that reshapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal through-line is clean: long stewardship → discovery of schematics → realization of covenant → decision to enact the ritual → renewed but hidden protection as new rulers arrive. The piece delivers clear closure via a resonant reconfiguration: Maruk’s stance toward his work and the palace’s fate is changed, with a before/after legible at dawn. Some middle material leans on expository summary (the history of the covenant and intervening scholars) rather than dramatized beats, slightly flattening escalation. Nonetheless, orientation, drive, and ending cost read as solidly constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where Mira’s attempt to repair the broken music box via Kael culminates in both his emotional release and the sanctuary’s stabilization. Causality is coherent under a hybrid lens—her argument → his micro-choice → grace settling, pin reappearing, garden solidifying. Closure is on the page with a legible before/after and conceptual cost, though the metaphysics (“cellular memory,” grace) are accepted rather than deeply tested. The stakes (world falling apart vs. emotional reconciliation) are aligned, not just declared.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure—woman arrives with sextant → Mira repurposes it into a mirror → the mirror briefly reveals the glass mountains—reads cleanly and lands in a charged final image (a mild RR/CR). Causality is intact, and the piece stays oriented in time/place with a consistent drive toward recreating the dream. However, there’s minimal on-page cost: Mira proceeds from commission to success without a meaningful moment where options narrow or failure is plausibly in play. This keeps the closure from feeling fully hard-won, even though the final glimpse is conceptually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with causal and accumulative logic: return → repair attempt → realization → daughter’s arrival. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after in Mira’s stance and options (isolation vs. the possibility of reconnection), and the emotional cost of the long estrangement is legible. Reflection/backstory is integrated via concrete anchors (the cathedral, tools, ribbon) and doesn’t blur time or who/where. The reunion at the very end is a touch convenient but still feels like a culmination rather than a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is clean: object arrival → retreat to bathroom → backstory reflection → pivotal inquiry → cameo’s response and final image. Causality is straightforward under a situational/accumulative lens, and the closure—Mira crossing from bewilderment toward understanding as the cameo activates—lands as a clear conceptual reconfiguration. However, the “forbidden knowledge” stake is not tested or costed on the page; the story assures its weight without dramatizing consequences, so the decisive moment reads more like fulfillment of a ritual than a pressured choice. Backstory is dense but anchored and doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: descent into the mountain, discovery of the time traveler’s failure, recognition of her true task, and a reweighted understanding of “rescue.” Causality is soft but legible—time traveler’s bargain fails, mountain destabilizes, council sends Elara, who reframes the mission—which supports a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. The main weakness is that the decisive “change” is almost entirely intellectual; no concrete threshold or irreversible action is taken on the page. Still, the final doorway and “single, crystalline note” provide a felt cadence that reads as a closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is structurally coherent: single continuous scene, clean orientation (ship, foggy bay, prow) and a clear throughline from card → memory history → garden → closing stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with the ship’s drift and fog thinning mirroring the deepening of Mira’s internal state. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits inwardly to the path toward the garden/names but without a sharp before/after line or explicit cost. Stakes and rules remain legible, yet the final shift feels more like a promise of story than a fully weighted conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: architectural anomaly → seal → rope-code → rebraiding → door, all within a single, well-contained scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing where the world’s rules about absence and history are reweighted by the discovery of the hidden room. The main limitation is that the cost of this revelation is mostly intellectual, so while the structure is tight, the stakes never quite bite.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the deepest cavern, diagnostic reading of the ice, recognition of the spiral as a bloom, and the act of inviting it, followed by a resting closure. Causality is solid under a mostly accumulative lens—each physical detail (cracks, stone’s hum, spiral) builds toward the moment of hush and her decision to return with others. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forges a sanctuary at clear personal and cultural cost (using a relic, bearing months of damage) and chooses rest before renewed responsibility. There are no orientation or logic slips; if anything, the design is a touch safe in how smoothly everything works.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: present in the pavilion → discovery of the prism → realization of its significance → decision to climb at midnight. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the piece does arrive at a Charged Poise closure, but the global drive remains fairly soft, with much of the word count spent on explanation rather than tightening options. The decisive “change” is primarily a plan, not an enacted turn, so the felt before/after is conceptual more than situational. Cost at the ending is hinted (solitary duty, risk of hope) but not concretely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: the storm’s rise and fall, the sequence of observations, and the final recording act build toward a conceptual reweighting of identity and memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she feels her own identity shifting into something inhabited rather than carried. Causality is light but coherent; nothing breaks orientation or logic. The main limitation is that the cost of this realization remains mostly conceptual and gently stated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: vanished stars → journey → fortress and note → preparation → ignition → communal response, all within a single coherent window. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the world’s situation feels slightly reweighted by her act. Causality holds and the note in mosaic is a clear inciting pivot, though the stakes are more thematic than situational. The cost at closure is modest but legible in the sense of effort and chosen responsibility rather than a hard sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed around a single high-stakes pause, with backstory tightly tied to present cues. As an accumulative/textural piece, pressure builds through layered images and memory rather than overt event. Closure lands in the act of offering the cicada and the sister’s softened response, a resonant reconfiguration that clearly marks a before/after. The main limitation is that the sharp words and prior rupture are kept off-page, so the inciting spark feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: one scene, one POV, with reflection woven through concrete present-moment anchors (the barrier, doll, sprout, clock of gravity). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira will go back down but with a fundamentally altered understanding of walls and fear, and that before/after is legible. Causality is soft but coherent: bunker childhood → climb during gravity shift → encounter with garden/doll/silence → new stance. Stakes remain internal and modestly escalated, so the structural arc is solid rather than breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene with a clear arc: detection of distress, tactical adjustment, intervention, and a reconfigured silence at the end. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: storm glass shift → route extension → catalytic ritual → emotional transformation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with the storm glass’s crystalline clarity and the boy’s unremembered comfort marking a tangible before/after. The cost and stakes are modest (a single child’s nightmare, a slight delay), which keeps the structural impact intimate rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: decades of study → midnight sally when stars align → orchard → pavilion/murals → activation of stairway → ascension. Closure is decisive and legible, but the cost of her choice (what she gives up, what transformation entails) remains abstract rather than felt. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with light backstory, which works at this length. The lack of a concrete test or complication on the way to success flattens the climax somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: sanctuary and backstory → discovery of the ring → onset of encroachment → apparition of the former self → decision to cross the threshold. Causality is metaphorical but legible; each new element deepens the central pressure rather than branching into side threads. Closure is solidly on the page with her stepping through the rebuilt door, a decisive change with clear cost. The story stays within a single, coherent window of time and space, and the reflective sections are anchored enough not to blur orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: glitchy texts → decision to bring the bolt → mushroom farm encounter → manifestation → emotional shift. The story orients who/where/when quickly and maintains a single, coherent scene with one clear transition into the farm. Closure lands as a decisive internal change: she relinquishes some of her defensive stance against promises, with the bolt’s transformation as pivot. The main limitation is that the mechanics of the “quantum promise” stay somewhat hand-wavy, keeping some stakes and costs more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    Orientation is clean and the causal chain to the gramophone activation is coherent, but the piece cuts off mid-sentence, just as the “truth” is about to be articulated. There is no complete on-page closure unit (no decisive change, no fully landed resonant reconfiguration, only a build toward one). The drive lens reads as causal-leaning hybrid, yet the core mystery (what choice the great-grandmother made, what it costs Elara now) is withheld by truncation rather than purposeful ellipsis. As a result, the structure functions as an inciting fragment, not a finished story.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is tight and legible: greenhouse → discovery of program → unconscious oath → marionettes awaken → manipulation sequence → dispersal and internal shift. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is clean—each step naturally leads to the next without contrivance. Closure lands: the greenhouse vanishes, Aldric walks back into the night changed, carrying a conceptual “gift,” with the cost of losing this literal refuge. The only limiter is that the global drive remains relatively quiet and introspective, so the arc feels more like a graceful deepening than a hard turn.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from general description of the archive to the specific file, to the button, to a reweighted understanding of Mara’s work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she decides to document the artifact “with a reverence that bordered on prayer,” reframing clerical work as near-sacramental. There’s no strong causal turn or high-stakes test, but for a quiet lyric piece the single tightening around the button suffices and costs (emotional burden, responsibility to memory) are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the audit triggers the escape, which leads to the lagoon, the tunnels, and the discovery of the deeper archive, culminating in her new mission. Closure is solid—a resonant reconfiguration where her role shifts from solitary preservation to active dissemination with clear implied risk. However, on-page obstacles are minimal; she slips out, navigates, and unlocks the shaft without meaningful resistance or complication. Structurally sound but a bit low on turns and friction for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one ritualized scene that escalates as the prophecy pushes harder, then resolves into temporary containment at sunrise. Causality within an accumulative/ritual lens holds: pressure from the code → targeted musical responses → a partial breach → his countermeasure and exhausted respite. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend—he wins the day but at ongoing cost, with the “another day, perhaps another century” line clearly framing before/after. A slightly clearer sense of what failure would look like on the page (beyond abstract “unravel reality”) could intensify the felt stakes but doesn’t break the design.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: leaf arrives → prophecy of drought and forgotten seed → descent to vault → retrieval → charged readiness to share, with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Seraphina’s lifetime of seemingly minor preservations re-prices itself as crucial preparation, and the future drought is now a present responsibility. However, the actual search in the vault is frictionless (no real obstacle, doubt, or time pressure dramatized), which softens the sense of cost at the climax. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative texture), held consistently but without a truly sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: grief → years of fruitless searching → letter → greenhouse → stairs, with clean causal links. However, closure is more of a poised threshold than a decisive change; the story stops as she begins the real descent, so the before/after cost remains mostly implied rather than enacted. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the final image of leaving the leaves/light behind works as a mild Resonant Reconfiguration, but the global drive doesn’t quite crest. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and there are no glaring causality breaks, just a sense that the piece cuts off one scene too soon.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by rain and the foundry, causally moving from grief and discovery to repair and revaluation. The decision to use kintsugi functions as the central turn, and the restored coin plus final realization provide a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost. The causal chain—coin found after funeral → realization of its significance → kintsugi repair → conceptual shift about names and legacy—holds without gaps. The piece is somewhat static externally, relying heavily on interior reflection and craft process rather than any complicating event, which keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive at gorge → prepare tools → face one recurring spirit → achieve a small, contained resolution → recommit to ongoing work. Causality is straightforward and legible, with each step following from the last, and the closure beat—his laughter and dispersal, her continued playing—reads as a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, and within that frame, the tightening from abstract role to this specific soldier works. Stakes remain relatively modest and success feels a bit preordained, so the scene never fully threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is a clean single shard anchored quickly: waking post-anesthesia, moving through the forest, arriving at the clearing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression from disorientation to the humming beacon to the charged clearing lands as a coherent build toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure is present and legible: she stands at the threshold, reweighing mercy and cost with the strap as persistent constraint. The main limit is the minimal external turn—pressure deepens more than options change, which keeps this just below elite-tier structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: we move from market arrival to consultation with the alchemist to revelation and acceptance in a single, coherent arc. Causality is clear—bringing the object to the visual史料 alchemist naturally triggers the painting, the explanation, and the reframing of the grandmother’s gift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets her long custodianship as preparation to become a Keeper, with a visible before/after. Stakes are primarily conceptual and emotional, and while they’re clear, the narrative could use one more concrete decision-point to sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single accumulating scene: lights fail, environment is inspected, anomalies lead to the hidden hatch. Causality is sound—dust patterns → air movement → presence → hatch—but the escalation is more textural than pressing. Closure lands as a charged poise image with Marcus reaching for the hatch, promising the story’s unwinding. The missing piece for a higher score is a clearer sense of what is at stake for him beyond curiosity and a vague pull, and a more legible cost bound to that closing act.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: morning frost as inciting cue → search in the orchard → discovery of the bottle → pressing and rupture → aftermath and cataloging. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the ending offers a clear conceptual repricing as the Library and cloud-sea reconfigure around the released whisper. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the central action (choosing to press the bottle) provides enough of a hinge for closure to land. Stakes are more abstract than embodied, yet the before/after of the Library’s state is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight: storm warning → preparation → storm hit/vision → aftermath and reframing, all under one coherent temporal-storm frame. Causality is clean (storms necessitate mirror protocol; protocol contains overlaps; vision slips through and reweights the historical dispute). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “truth” and revolution, with the mirror-covering act as a charged final beat. Stakes remain more intellectual/emotional than situationally acute, but the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean: who he is, where he is, and the broad when (decades after “midnight stole the light”) land early, and the scene is a single, continuous present with interwoven backstory. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story builds from reflection and preparation toward the concrete act of tethering moonlight and the orchestrion’s awakening, which functions as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is simple but sound: covenant → years of collecting light → tonight’s attempt → the partial success with felt limits. The cost is implicit (a lifetime of labor for a partial, fragile victory), but that conceptual price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric mode: factory closure → compass arrival/psychometry → descent → lagoon → decision not to return, with each step “because/therefore” linked. Orientation is clear very early (who Elara is, where we are, what she does), and the through-line of following the compass into the earth is easy to track. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: her journey from collector to arrival-without-collection is legible and conceptually costly. The only limitation is that the life consequences of staying underground remain mostly conceptual rather than felt in the final beat, which blunts the sense of sharp before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: GPS failure → storm/archway shelter → lantern slide revelation → return to studio and new project. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, where her practice is re-understood as part of a timewoven conversation, and the before/after is legible. Causality is coherent, but the stakes remain modest and primarily intellectual/emotional, with limited on-page consequence beyond a new resolve. The piece functions well as a single, focused lyric scene, but doesn’t quite achieve the structural inevitability a top-tier venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation is clean: we know who Mira is, where she is, and the temporal span (autumn into late winter) very early. Structure is linear and coherent: study → pattern of mornings → discovery of the hidden etchings → conceptual shift → recommitment to the mural. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the question of night-blooming into a moral/aesthetic stance about unseen beauty, and it lands clearly though with soft cost. The main weakness is that the “months of not noticing” followed by a single epiphanic glance leans slightly convenient without intermediate attempts or near-misses to texture the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: diary arrives → deciphering → recognition from the air → descent to lagoon → encounter with grandmother. Structure adheres to a single throughline and lands a clear closure unit when the grandmother’s appearance reframes Miriam’s life’s work into an explicit charge to witness. The main weakness is that the climax is partially summarized (“She spoke of…”) rather than dramatized, softening the felt impact of the parley’s terms and cost. Still, the before/after in knowledge and role is legible and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: he brings the paradox bottle to the cove, uses memory instead of magic, and the town is reimagined as a result. The single-scene structure is coherent and the closure beat—Elias stepping into the new civilization he has catalyzed—reads as a decisive change with a conceptual cost (abandoning wish-based comfort permanently). Escalation is modest but present in the shift from empty ruins to emerging hands, shops, and children. The lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear and elegant: present silence → ascent to garden → immersion in recording → realization that the foghorn’s end is a threshold, not decay. The closure is a conceptual repricing of the world’s noise and silence, landing in the final image of Seraphine as listener to the dead with a felt, if quiet, cost. Causality is coherent and pattern-driven (the grandmother’s field trip memory paying off as prophecy); no orientation or lens-clarity issues. The only limit is that the cost and future implications of her new role are more implied than dramatized in that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulation: orientation (atrium, lineage, egg), conceptual build (vortex inheritance / entropy), then execution of the ritual and a conceptual shift at the end. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: her decades of study and the hatching logically lead to the ritual and the realization about time as “borrowed forward.” Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing, but the concrete cost at the end is soft, residing in implied generational sacrifice rather than a sharply framed on-page consequence. The reflective density is high yet anchored enough that present-time pressure never fully disappears, though it stays more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: glue cures → diagnostics → switch is tested → siren propagates → storm front appears on schedule, with “zero hour” tying preparation to event. Structure is tight and linear in a single scene, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after in the system moving from potential to activated. Closure functions as a resonant confirmation rather than a sharp decisive change—her act works exactly as intended, with no surprise or reversal. The implied communal cost if it failed sits in the background, keeping the stakes present but largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: arrival → practice → specific star fragment → carrying it away, with a clear closure beat in the final paragraph. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration of their work as sacred witnessing. However, the plot is more meditative routine than pressured sequence, with no meaningful disruption or decision that sharply reconfigures options. The result is elegant but light on structural tension for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: wasteland/apiary establishment → ghost’s appearance → indicated burial spot → excavation of the box → transfer of covenant and ghost’s release. Causality is straightforward and legible, with no orientation issues, and the piece adheres well to a single-scene, single-POV frame. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s role shifts from recluse-observer to keeper of a covenant, with the before/after clearly marked. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a light causal spine, and that blend holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: orientation is quick, the rediscovered fragment focuses the piece, and the garage-sale listings provide a recurring tactic. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of time (“space between breaths”), clearly reweighting prior material with a recognizable before/after. Cost is present but subtle: the implied obsolescence of measurement and her professional identity is not fully dramatized. The piece leans heavily on reflection, but it remains anchored to present stimuli enough that the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: storm aftermath → discovery → tending → observation → conceptual reframing → release/return home. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the poet’s understanding of unfinishedness reweights the kite, feather, and bird, with the final walk home carrying that repriced meaning. Causality is modest but intact; each beat follows plausibly from the last. The biggest limitation is that the central “drive” (to tend/respond to brokenness) never faces a meaningful obstacle, so the cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a single continuous scene whose reflections all spring from present-tense cues (pillars, diary, copper wire) and feed into the closing image. The global drive is textural rather than causal, with pressure accruing via the juxtaposition of her impending death and the long timescales of trees and stone. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the final paragraph, where her ongoing work is framed as her chosen response to the terminal clock. The lack of any structural surprise or turn beyond deepening reflection keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: ascent → chamber with amber → realization → descent, with backstory and alien lore woven coherently into the present via reflection. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through layered associations (tower, amber, aliens, homecoming) toward a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality within the quiet frame is sound—her prior rebellion and the alien contact naturally lead her to this solitary experiment in meaning-making. The closure carries cost (loss of old certainties and institutional home) and a before/after stance without any orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walk to jetty → contextual reflection → planting spell → first green shoot. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early, and the magical-ecological rules are legible enough for the ending to read clearly. Closure is present as a small but decisive change (reef begins to regrow), but the price paid is mostly off-page and conceptual rather than dramatized in the moment. The drive lens is consistently textural/accumulative rather than causal-thriller, and holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-time search frame interwoven with concise backstory, leading to a single realization about how to read the cylinder. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—what changes is knowledge and interpretation, not situation, and the closure (reframing distance and love) is legible with emotional cost. The setup of the cylinder as an unsolved problem, then the tactile solution, pays off prior mentions of lost methods and the narrator’s sensory gifts. Escalation is quiet and mostly intellectual/emotional, but it coheres and the ending beat clearly marks a before/after in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The single-scene structure is clear and coherent: she arrives, prepares her ritual, experiences the glimpse, and reinterprets her situation, closing on a stable new stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each move (approach, touch glass, glimpse, sketch) layers toward a conceptual repricing of “true north” and her pariah role. Closure is strong—a resonant reconfiguration where the shutdown is reframed as a beginning, with an on-page cost in her accepted isolation and responsibility. The main limitation is the low level of concrete jeopardy or consequence in the present moment; all major costs remain largely historical or conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is simple and coherent: past theft → devised restitution via chess pieces → meeting Seraph → emotional resolution. The meta “Wait—I have miscounted and must begin again” introduces a structural restart that feels more like an accidental double-draft than a purposeful mosaic, slightly muddling the piece’s drive lens. Closure is present—he completes the amend and experiences a felt shift—but the cost is implied more in backstory than in a present, pressured choice. The second, streamlined version also drops some earlier set-ups (e.g., detailed Archive lore) without an explicit payoff, leaving a faint sense of unkept promise.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: present-tense walking in the gallery, interleaved with past interregnum memories, resolving in the “beginning” pattern as a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong; the dome’s acoustics and the archive premise pay off in the final image where history is “written in footsteps.” The closure cost—accepting that some histories will not answer back—is on the page and conceptually clear. Escalation is understated, with more deepening than decisive turn, which keeps the piece just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sanctuary → temptation (stone) → condition (seed-question) → deliberation → commitment → reconfiguration and departure. Causality is intact under a largely internal lens: because she accepts the keeper’s requirement, she asks the honest question, which unlocks memory and redefines “home,” leading to her choice to leave. Closure is a decisive change with cost—she reorients from hiding to carrying her gift outward—while the last image (bookstore exhaling, keeper watching) gives a resonant sense of before/after. Reflection is well-anchored in present action and doesn’t blur orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from avoidance to engagement to reconfiguration, with the thunder/lull and time-freeze framing the arc. Causality is straightforward—finding and decoding the tapestry leads to a reframing of her “failure” just as the lull ends. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis rather than a decisive external change, and the cost (relinquishing a self-image shaped by blame) is legible. The piece is more accumulative/lyric than plot-driven, but within that lens the progression is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene framed by the impending ritual, with reflection interleaved but always anchored to present stimuli. Causality is coherent—her early decision to arrive early and speak poems leads to the children’s chorus, which then blunts the ritual’s power and reconfigures the stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has already made the ritual impotent and redefined forgiveness internally. The main limitation is that the priests’ arrival does not materially change options or force a new tactical choice, so the climax feels more like payoff of a plan than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: the “three breaths left” clock, the progressive matching of scars to memories, and the final reframing of the workshop all cohere. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the same drowning workshop is re-seen as rebirth, with uncertainty recast as “honest magic.” Causality is mostly internal and psychological, which suits the design, though the acid sea’s apparent retreat borders on convenient or metaphorically over-neat. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the pressure of the acid sea remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: wandering → wrong turn → hidden chamber → shell recognition → reflection-vision → release, culminating in a decisive internal shift. Causality is tight under a slightly uncanny but legible logic (the shell, the reflection, the memory-vision), and closure lands cleanly with Marcus’s redefinition of his promise and exit from the caves. The cost—letting go of the talisman and his old conception of permanence—is on the page and conceptually felt. The “wrong turn” and the shell’s impossible presence read more as numinous coincidence than pressure-driven causality, which slightly softens structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: heat wave → night garden opening → Thessaly’s absence and the box → Mira’s decision to use vibrations of intent → ships turning → logbook coda. Causality is coherent and the closure lands via a clear before/after—Mira tests the logbook method and confirms “the whispers were right,” which reconfigures the premise. The drive lens feels Hybrid (causal events with an accumulative lyric charge), and that holds consistently. The main limitation is that the “moment felt right” trigger for opening the box is a bit soft, underplaying the sense of a single, sharply defined turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: abandoned station → explanation of Mara’s role → midnight call as inciting pressure → decision to meet → walk → encounter and reweighting of the station in the final image. Causality is straightforward (the call produces the walk and encounter), and the situational drive—Mara answering grief-born calls—holds consistently through closure. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change: the “dark beacon” is reframed as unnecessary because true navigation happens between people, with some cost in Mara’s ongoing immersion in others’ pain. The piece leans heavily on exposition and stated pattern rather than dramatizing multiple beats of live navigation, which slightly flattens tension despite solid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: climb through storm damage → reach orchard/cache → unite glass eye with textbooks → choose to settle and study. Causality holds and orientation is strong from the opening; the accumulative drive of ruin/persistence imagery coheres. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to forbidden study in a perilous world, with a felt conceptual cost. However, the pressure arc is gentle and largely reflective, so the before/after hinge feels more like a deepened stance than a decisive turn under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: stranger arrives with boutonnière → enigmatic gesture and disappearance → Aldric’s investigation of absences → discovery of the hidden note → recovered personal memory → decision to write. The drive lens is essentially causal with reflective deepening, and the final choice to follow the address provides on-page closure with an implied cost of disrupting his stasis. The convenient timing of the full recollection once he notices the paper is slightly neat, compressing a complex emotional turn into a single beat. Still, structure is coherent and scaled well for the length, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—from father’s death and inheritance, to map and chip, to ants, to cavern, to door, to decision—is clean and legible, and the story fits a tight single-scene-with-backstory structure. Closure lands as a decisive change: she steps through the doorway while the creek rises, foreclosing her old life. The cost is suggested (risk of drowning, loss of her known world) rather than explicitly felt, but the imagery supports a credible sense of price. There are no major orientation or lens slips; structure is solid if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single causal line from warning → climb → grotto → revelation. Orientation is strong early and the accumulative/textural drive (images of wounds, starlight, silver, fireflies) coheres to a closure where she reinterprets the warning and her role. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of the summons and a stance shift, but the decisive change feels low-cost and almost guaranteed once she arrives. The mystery resolves as recognition rather than conflict tested by obstacles, which trims dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from return → reflection on the shell and research → present-moment secret and final repricing of what the shell means. Orientation is strong early—who, where, and when are legible within the opening lines—and the ember nexus/pocket-sun/shell triad holds the scene together. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “The shell doesn’t hold the secret. We do.” reweights all prior material with a subtle but clear cost (relinquishing the fantasy of perfect capture). The limitation is that the drive never tightens beyond reflection; structurally, it’s a graceful arc rather than a pressured one.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is accumulative/textural: present-moment with the scroll, then the grave memory, dream of the younger self, returning to the almost-full scroll and tomorrow’s plan. Orientation is clean early (mountain ranger cabin, solitary chronicler, discovered grave), and the nonlinear time is thematically purposeful rather than confusing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes the grave and his chronicle as waystation and communication across selves, with the decision to send the scroll and surrender to dreaming. The causal spine is thin but coherent for a lyric piece, with each reflection anchored in present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative single scene: arrival in the fog, backstory of loss, integration into the shop, the screw’s revelation, and a closing reorientation in step with the fog lifting. Causality is emotional rather than event-driven but coherent: loss → new job → discovery of Mira’s past → reframing of what her own work has always been. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elena’s stance toward her loss changes—and the persistent constraint (anosmia) clearly shapes that. No orientation or lens issues; the drive as textural deepening holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating pressure from storm, ritual, and inner blockage toward a clear conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is coherent (stress → crystallizing → reframed understanding → new way of writing), and the “breath between storms” notion ties the midpoint to closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after of her relationship to her magic is legible. The cost is primarily internal and retrospective, so the ending reads powerful but slightly low-impact in terms of on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one temporal window with a clear clock (orchard crews), descent into archive, confrontation, and return to the surface, all coherently causal. The induced currents’ rules are sketched just enough for the fading connection to function as a structural hinge and closure mechanism. A bit of up-front exposition about her job feels slightly decoupled from the immediate scene pressure, but doesn’t break flow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: apology given, connection lost, but options and meaning reweighted going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.9)
    The piece reads as a single accumulating scene with a clean spatial throughline, but there is effectively no turn, escalation, or closure yet. Elara moves toward the Spiral of Arbitration and begins her ritual, but nothing reconfigures options or knowledge in a way that creates a before/after. The drive lens is clearly accumulative/textural, yet even under that lens the passage stops mid-approach rather than landing a resonant reweighting. It feels like the first half of a story, not a complete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: from midnight whistle to first light, the text builds toward a conceptual repricing of what clocks measure. Causality is simple but coherent—her routine actions and long apprenticeship culminate in the alignment night and realization. Closure is present and legible, but the cost of that realization is only lightly implied (a life given over to this station, solitude, patience) rather than dramatized. The piece reads more as a polished vignette or lyric meditation than a fully pressurized story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene lyric accumulation leading to the small but decisive turn when the man finally speaks and names her leaving. Causality is understated but coherent: years of chosen distance culminate in this threshold moment, allowing a Resonant Reconfiguration of what “letting go” means. Orientation is strong from the first line; the mushroom farm frame and approach of the figures are clear. The cost—accepting intimacy that exists only through maintained distance as she departs—is legible in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure—library → subway reminiscence → hospital—reads as a clean, causal progression with a strong accumulative texture: each shard (library scents, math memories, graffiti) reweights the visit to the father. Orientation is clear from the first sentence and never in doubt, and the narrative holds a single POV and throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara reframes the scrawls (and by extension gambling and risk) as invitations to “stop playing and start living,” with the father present to receive it. Stakes remain intimate rather than dramatically escalated, but the emotional cost of that reframing is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative vignette: present-moment set-up of Mira in the tunnel, interleaved with backstory and conceptual framing, culminating in the harmonica’s note and the phone ringing. Under a textural lens, the closure functions as a Charged Poise—the pattern of anonymous listening is about to recommence, newly weighted by the disc-as-grief metaphor. Causality is minimal but coherent; there are no orientation issues and all introduced elements (job, wrong numbers, disc) are paid off conceptually. The main limitation is that the final beat reaffirms a status quo rather than registering a sharper before/after cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene on the jetty with interleaved reflection that always anchors back to concrete stimuli, and a clear before/after in how she interprets preservation. The drive is accumulative/textural, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when she reconceives the covenant and makes a new promise. Causality is more emotional than event-driven, but the progression of perception (photo → fear of scrutiny → acceptance) is coherent. A slightly sharper mid-story turn or disruption in the present could have tightened the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story’s structure is clean: arrival, proposition, terms of the “economy,” and a clear turning point when the logistician names their need and accepts the condition to stay. Causality holds under a largely situational/accumulative lens, and closure lands as a decisive change in behavior with a visible price (remaining until midnight, breaking their pattern of flight). A touch more on-page friction or hesitation around accepting the trade would deepen the sense of earned difficulty at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: ring warms → journey via sound → stillpoint → realization that the doorway is inward. Orientation is solid early—who, where, and what she wants are all legible, and the world’s rules remain self-consistent. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines navigation and carries a new “map” back out. The main limitation is that the journey unfolds with almost no complication or narrowing of options, so the structural path feels more inevitable than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-moment problem (anomalous signal), interwoven backstory (misclassified Proxima transmission), and a culminating realization that the signal is a response and her exile itself is a kind of filter. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her nonstandard method leads to deciphering the signal, which in turn reconfigures her view of her past mistake. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she accepts her bent path as meaningful—with a quiet but legible before/after line. Stakes remain largely internal and professional, yet the emotional and conceptual shift at the end is clear and paid for by the earlier career loss.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene at the harbor framed by concise backstory, with a clear tightening when Elena arrives and Marina abandons rote stories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as silence, memory, and gesture build toward a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands with Marina’s conceptual repricing of recording vs. remembering and a new stance toward grief and translation. The arc is quiet and could support slightly sharper external stakes, but within its mode the causality and cadence are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arson → exile → hunt for Archive → trail of art → self-portrait → hidden tapestry → fulfilled promise, with no major logic gaps. The single key on-page turn—discovering and opening the vandalized portrait—tracks well, and the subsequent revelation reconfigures her past and present. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: knowledge must be preserved differently, and her three-year stay implies a substantial cost. The middle does lean on summary rather than dramatized beats, which keeps escalation and price somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation to treatment and garden, revelation of the entangled memories, timed approach to the hush, then the ritual that bridges to the lagoon and Mira. Causality is intact—without the experimental protocol there’s no entanglement, without the hush and drumming there’s no visible response—and the final image is a resonant reconfiguration where Elara’s role shifts from patient to co-creator of Mira’s dream. Closure cost is present but mostly conceptual (risking deeper involvement, further experimentation, relinquishing the option to “just be a subject”), which keeps this from a higher score. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings) stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: storm knocks out tech → Reyes’s challenge → Mira’s whisper-based tactics → mass evacuation → Reyes’s concession and conceptual shift. The piece leans Hybrid with a strong Situational flavor, resolving through stance and conceptual repricing rather than big plot reversals, and that lens holds to the end. The evacuation itself is mostly summarized (“By midnight, she had guided two hundred workers to safety”), which keeps the structure from feeling fully dramatized at its most pivotal practical moment. Closure is solid: the world’s hierarchy of knowledge reweights, with a clear before/after and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene, backstory woven through concrete present cues, and a clear Charged Poise closure as the two sit in “stillwater tension.” The causal chain (her wait → his arrival → the light patterns → his attention and recognition) is legible and satisfying. Closure has cost—her ongoing commitment to this vigil, the boy stepping back from the “calculation” of despair—but it remains gently implied rather than sharply crystallized in a single decisive beat. The drive lens is coherent throughout and holds at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure: library/grotto → teaching → window displays → ripple effects → closing forest image, and this pattern is clean and legible. The closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise: the final “forest of new possibilities” reweights all prior quiet acts, making the before/after of the town’s mindset clear even if subtle. Causality is soft but coherent—Eleanor’s methods → children/parents/strangers’ micro-rebellions—and no major setups are left dangling. The main limit is that the story reads more like an elegant mythic case-study than a scene with a sharply felt turning point or explicitly dramatized cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored at the docks, punctuated by a concise backstory that clearly informs the present choice. The causality is accumulative rather than plotty—the whale’s call, her memories of the occupation, and the scrimshaw’s reinterpreted meaning build toward a decisive act of stepping into the water. Closure is strong: there is an unmistakable before/after in her stance toward self-protection, with the scrimshaw left behind as a visible cost. The piece remains modest in scope, but within that scope, no major causality gaps or unkept setups undercut it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece runs under an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory, deepening rather than sharply turning the central pressure of living under the mandate. Causality is coherent: mandate → mother’s death → theaters converted → retreat to farmhouse → gaming the speakers, culminating in the closing stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she consciously maintains her blank face as defiance—with cost implicit in isolation and the loss of genuine mourning. Structure is clean and well within the scope; the only limitation is that external situational stakes remain mostly retrospective, with no new complication introduced in the present-time frame.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from threshold to heart of the colonnade to exit, with each step forward accompanied by a perceptual deepening. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from watching light on the lake to physically crossing boundaries to conceptual reframing lands as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact (ban lifts → she goes → contact with columns + reframing dissolve “walls” → new poem). Closure with conceptual before/after is clear, though the cost and stakes remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene where Mira’s habitual practice leads to the apprentice’s “awakening” and the passing of the reed tongue. Causality is legible—her arrangements provoke his curiosity, his question prompts her to deepen the language, and the gift seals the arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the apprentice kneels to learn and the “language of awakening” is conceptually repriced as tradable. The main weakness is the low on-page cost; her sacrifice is thematically framed but not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: orientation is immediate, and the piece coherently builds from object to method to purpose to pre-trial poised ending. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“all journeys were in some sense artificial”—that reweights the entire project with a legible, if quiet, cost. That said, there’s minimal on-page complication or reversal; most steps are expository rather than dramatized through concrete beats of failure or resistance. The result is structurally sound but a bit too frictionless for top-tier marks.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a reflective opening that establishes the observatory and teacher, then a present-time arrival culminating in the offer to meet a future self. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds a steady pattern of setting and role to support a quiet Charged Poise closure. Causality is light but coherent—nothing breaks, yet the path from sensing an arrival to stepping through the curtains lacks real complication or decision pressure. The final step through the curtains registers as a meaningful shift in stance, but the cost of that move is mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal line from Soren’s arrival to the reading to his confession and departure. The inferred lens is largely accumulative/textural—the spread, tape, and rain gradually reframe the collapse—yet there is also a tidy because/therefore chain in his choice to come, her method, and his eventual admission. Closure is a modest but clear Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he leaves having reweighted his obsession and accepted complicity, symbolized by carefully rolling the tape. The stakes are intimate and the escalation quiet, but there are no causality gaps or structural missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a single, coherent ritual scene with embedded backstory, oriented cleanly in the archive from the first paragraph. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through the dance, the rising motes, and the dissolving boundary between self and nostalgia. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she understands her role is to become part of the purified memories and chooses to step into the pagoda. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through external consequences, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: we move from present work to historical context to the specific mother/child frame and back to Mira’s ongoing vigil, culminating in a quiet reweighting of hope and Unbinding. Orientation is clean—who/where/when are legible very early—and the library/footage pattern is stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of her vigil and the warmed river stone reframes the Unbinding as transformation rather than pure loss, with an implied cost in the grief she curates. Still, there is only a modest sense of before/after; the structure builds atmosphere more than it tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the greenhouse, with backstory triggered by the tail and integrated into present-tense choices. The closure—a reconfiguration of what Aldric, her work, and certainty mean—lands clearly with real cost (her shattered belief and the need to lead others through the same). Escalation is subtle but coherent as her understanding deepens alongside the reconstruction act. The piece avoids plot tangles, though the structural arc is more steady than sharply turning, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: hourglass → descent → discovery of tunnel and vigil → secret chamber → emotional reconstrual, all causally linked. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, even with the surgery/telepathy backstory folded in. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her understanding of the past and of her own survival irreversibly shifts, with clear emotional cost. The causal drive is quiet rather than high-tension, but consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: Mira arrives with a goal, conducts the reading, deepens through layered visions, then reaches a closure choice to re-conceal the reel. Causality is clean within that frame—touching the strip leads to visions which reweight her understanding and decision—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reconceives “goodbye letters” as intention that doesn’t require delivery, and this redefines her task. Still, plot pressure is modest and there’s essentially one long movement rather than a strongly marked structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene arc that moves from static torment through a single, meaningful turn—her choice to sit, rest, and stop forcing inspiration—toward a resonant reconfiguration of her relationship to creativity. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: long-term pressure → surrender → stardust stirring → words arriving. Closure lands clearly with a before/after boundary and a felt cost (relinquishing control and the identity wrapped in striving). The stakes remain inward and somewhat abstract, but the piece does not lose orientation or its throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-journey structure: walk → jolt/check of cargo → merchant encounter → reaffirmed purpose and charged final image. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the encounter modestly tightens the initial stake of safeguarding hope/possibility artifacts and culminates in a conceptual repricing of “hope” and “light.” Closure is present and coherent, with a before/after in how the frozen moment and the sparks are framed. Escalation is more gentle than gripping, but there are no causality or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: repeated awakenings, the recurring gear, the traversal of the jungle, the barrier, and finally the doorway form a legible arc. Causality is soft but present—his deepened understanding and choice to use the gear “because of” the growing hum of insight bring forth the unraveling and doorway. Closure lands as a decisive conceptual and practical shift: he recognizes there is no “back” and steps through, foreclosing his former life. Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, with minimal on-page friction at the climax, which keeps this below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: vigil → guides’ arrival → ascent along the ridgeway → fork and renunciation → first step onto the new path, forming a clear before/after. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each stage deepens rather than resets the central dilemma. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she forecloses the path of safe stasis by letting the leash fall and committing to the middle way, with emotional cost legible on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the outset and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene ascent up the staircase, under an Accumulative/Textural lens where each perception (snow, bolt, dust, memories) deepens the central question of safety and silence. Causality is modest but coherent: the sight and feel of the bolt trigger the reflection on safety, his brother, and the unpardonable silence, culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing—Marcus reframes safety as “quiet accomplice” and his own silence as a belief-choice—with felt cost in his guilt. The main limitation is the lack of external consequence or turn beyond discovery and reinterpretation, which keeps the structure quiet rather than fully tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: we move from description of the library and Threnody’s role to the slow reveal of her method and the projected moment of justice. Causality under a textural lens holds: the ink, marginalia, and lineage test build toward the final charged image of the future scholar and the impending collapse of the pretender’s reign. Closure is a solid Charged Poise—options at the end are reconfigured, though the cost of the coming change is more implied than sharply rendered. No orientation issues, but escalation remains mostly conceptual and summary-led rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a stable pattern (tapping/data collection) is established, then disrupted by an unexpected data anomaly that leads to a reconfiguration of understanding at the end. Causality is intact and legible—buoy readings → anomaly → atlas consultation → new realization—and the orientation in time, place, and task is solid from early on. Closure arrives via a Conceptual Repricing: migration paths are not lost but transformed, and this reweights the entire frame of her monitoring work. The cost is mostly implicit (years spent mourning vanished paths), but it’s readable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from bay to circle to exit, with backstory tightly interleaved and clearly anchored to present stimuli. Causality is sound under a mostly accumulative lens: she waits, listens, interprets the hum, and that experience leads directly to a resolved decision about the rebellion’s next phase. Closure is unmistakable and on the page—a decisive internal reorientation plus a physical departure to “carry the circle’s hum to the others.” The only limit is that the external world’s response and constraints remain entirely offstage, keeping the change largely conceptual rather than tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: lightning → lifelong gift → eruption/reconstruction → embryo discovery → plants’ reaction → kite script → decision to unseal. Structure is mostly a single continuous scene with integrated backstory that tilts each present choice, and closure lands as a charged decision to break with elders’ orders. However, the cost of that decision remains largely conceptual; we’re told of prior persecution but don’t see any present counterforce on the page. The result is satisfying but not maximally tense or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: lighthouse arrival → greenhouse restoration → somatic coping → crystallizing moment with the cereus. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, with each passage adding density to her relationship with place and body. Closure lands cleanly in the final paragraph as a resonant reconfiguration of her project, with an on-page cost in her acceptance of non-escape. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive at lighthouse → encounter broken tarot → follow threads downward → emerge reconfigured. Causality is internally consistent and the descent provides a legible spine, with the closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of fragmentation and self. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized but still perceptible in her relinquishing of singular, stable portraits. The piece could benefit from one more concrete beat where her new stance is tested rather than only realized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: one scene, clear orientation (who/where/when) early, and a coherent causal chain from investigation to disappearance. Closure lands: he knowingly enters the same mystery that took Vasquez, with an implied cost of self-erasure. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative—the accumulating observations about ink/time culminate in a single decisive act. The main weakness is that the turn from study to self-sacrificial immersion is under-pressured; it feels inevitable but not sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the letter, comprehension of its implications, internal debate, then the decision to transmit, yielding a clear before/after. Causality is straightforward (letter → revelation → conflict → action), and the closure is a Decisive Change complemented by a conceptual reweighting of the war’s history. The cost of her choice remains largely implied and future-facing, so the resolution feels thematically tidy rather than sharply consequential on the page. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens, building from present gardening into backstory and outward chaos, then resolving in a redefinition of peace that clearly closes the arc (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean, and the single POV and location are stable. That said, there’s minimal structural turn: the arrival of travelers hints at a test but passes without friction, so pressure never quite tightens. The closure is conceptually satisfying but not strongly earned by on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: storm → garden’s appearance → learning its rules → ritual approach → receiving the echo → morning aftermath. The accumulative drive (understanding and attuning to the garden) leads smoothly to a resonant reconfiguration where Morwen and the spike now carry the goddess’s song. Causality is intact, with clear “because/therefore” moves (his silence and movement allow the echo to settle). The main limitation is that the cost of the closure (what it means to carry a god’s final song) is more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s accusation → ascent to observatory → structured logical review of her actions → realization of internal sabotage → decision to investigate. The single-scene frame with a brief stair-descent shard is coherent, and the closure beat (choosing to hunt the conspirator, framed as breaking generational orbits) lands clearly as a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are quickly legible. The only limitation is that the cost and risk of her decision remain mostly conceptual and projected—no immediate on-page complication tests the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → lab → amber/firmware → coordinates → chamber with looping moment → decision to intervene. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with lyric shading, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise as Mira stands poised to rewrite the “broken timeline.” Closure lands conceptually—the before/after of unresolved guilt vs. an active attempt at redemption is legible—but the decisive change is more promised than dramatized, with minimal on-page cost or complication as she moves into the final chamber. Structure is otherwise tight and coherent for the length, with one clear escalation through the coordinates to the folded-time room.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in crisis → mandala work and heightened perception → tile discovery → emergent hush → reconfigured stance. Causality holds under a textural lens, with each sensory and reflective beat deepening rather than derailing the scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of order/chaos and of her relationship to art, with the act of pocketing the warm tile giving it a concrete endpoint. Stakes and cost remain relatively quiet, which keeps the piece from feeling fully decisive at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear: present-tense ruin → introduction of Lysara’s condition and mission → discovery of Soren → decision to rename him via the tessera, culminating in a charged final image. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each layer of worldbuilding (fire, retrocognition, naming art) feeds the final act without breaks. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules about loss and memory are reweighted by the act of renaming, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. The lack of concrete obstacles or temporal pressure keeps the arc from fully tightening into a high-stakes structural snap.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: nocturnal entry → sensing Mira → confrontation in the garden → coin-fueled vision → choice and release. Causality is straightforward and legible, with the coin’s echoes serving as the central mechanism that reconfigures options. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira’s failure is repriced and Elara is released from her tether. The main limitation is that the cost of Elara’s “freedom” and what it forecloses is only lightly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: static shock → altered crystal → experimental contact → expanded perception → resolve to develop a new method. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, where images and sensations build toward a conceptual repricing of “connection” and “telepathy.” Closure is clear in her decision to forgo pills in favor of a consent-based, somatic approach, though the cost of that choice is more implied than dramatized. There are no orientation issues or causality breaks, but the stakes of the shift remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where present action (moving through the cave, approaching the fossil, entering the pool) steadily accumulates into a conceptual revelation. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing when she realizes she is becoming the voice of the unknown. The cost is mostly conceptual—an acceptance of responsibility rather than a tangible loss—which slightly softens the impact. Orientation is solid from the opening, and no major set-ups go unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: morning routine → discovery of jar → interpretive labor → recognition by High Seers → return to work, with a clear before/after in how prophecy is conceived. Causality is coherent (the jar triggers the new system), and the closure—prophecy refigured as living, participatory process—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with some felt cost. However, all major work (“the following weeks”) is summarized rather than dramatized and no beat truly tightens external options, so escalation reads mostly conceptual, not situational. The ending is satisfying but low-pressure, with the stakes framed in abstract historical terms rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: climb to bluff → decode snow → wait/reflect → ally appears → decision/hand-off, with a legible before/after in her willingness to trust and act. Causality holds and the single-scene frame is appropriate, with backstory anchored to concrete present cues (the snow, the pillbox, the scars). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, but it’s on the page and coherent under a situational/accumulative lens. The main weakness is that much of the “mission” and conspiracy pressure remains summarized offstage, so the on-page turn feels more conceptual than dramatically forced.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: waiting, reflection, and then the quiet act of boarding the barge. Orientation is clean and the present frame never blurs, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of the promise as “carrying is fulfillment” embodied by stepping onto the barge—lands. Still, structural turns are very gentle; there’s only a modest sense of before/after, with most movement occurring in reflective abstraction rather than on-page shifts in options or knowledge. The cost at closure is more implied than distinctly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: journey → discovery of the oasis and lantern → experiential revelation of fractured timelines → conceptual reframing and decision to take the glass. Causality is intact under a textural lens, and closure arrives as a clear conceptual repricing that redefines “change” vs. “loss” and Mira’s responsibility to carry the oasis forward. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional—bearing witness and stewardship—rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off, but it is legible and integrated into the final decision. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the world’s light/timeline rules are introduced and then used rather than explained away.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by the dead rosebush and harbor, with a clear causal chain from Maren’s vigil to the interaction with the child and the planting of the cutting. The closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—no big external turn, but a legible before/after in the girl’s relationship to her loss and in Maren’s active transmission of her father’s ethos. Stakes are modest and mostly internal, yet the story doesn’t meander; each beat (memory of father, arrival of child, gift of object, planting) builds on the last. The cost—living with unfixable loss while choosing to foster future growth—is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: from initial contact with the sundial and rising tide, through backstory and function of the library, to the new volume and reframed understanding of extinction. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens—the reincarnation memory primes her, the sundial reveals possibilities, and its shadow pointing to a new book prompts the culminating realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of extinction and her role, with a felt cost in the centuries of grief she has carried. The piece remains static in physical terms, but structurally it tightens toward that interior turn without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: rain → temple → nest → reflection on letters → idea of installation → closing reprisal with the nest and new self-understanding. Causality is soft but coherent (storm dislodges nest, nest triggers revaluation of her work), and orientation in time and space is impeccable. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her role from “keeper of secrets” to “weaver of connection,” with a clear before/after. The missing piece is a stronger sense of price or foreclosed alternative at the end, which keeps this from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: she detects anomalous frequencies, deduces their source, calculates a counter-signal, and broadcasts it, leading to a change in campus behavior. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; we always know who, where, and roughly when we are. Closure lands as a decisive change—the manipulation is disrupted and Maya’s ongoing role is established—but the lack of obstacles or complications makes the arc feel slightly schematic. The cost of success (beyond lost sleep and risk to equipment) is underplayed, which limits the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: she enters the tunnels because of the texts and her grandfather, the organ’s paralysis is the key obstacle, the compass guides her to the alcove, she retrieves the key, and the experience reconfigures her relationship to fear. The scene is continuous, well-oriented, and the closure reads as a decisive change plus a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is present in the emotional trial of claustrophobia and the implied burden of carrying on the rebellion. The main softness is that the compass solves the spatial puzzle a bit too easily, limiting tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single scene at the quarry framed by concise backstory about Marguerite and Elena’s prior cases, all driving toward the completion of the portrait. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through layered reflection rather than event turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elena affirms her role as giver of peace, not solver of crimes. Causality is modest but intact (the ribbon → quarry visit → painting → decision to send it to the sister), and the closure is legible with a conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the progression from arrival to departure involves no meaningful complication or new constraint, so the narrative feels more like a beautifully rendered ritual than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: curiosity → stonewalled questioning → turn to journals → discovery of erasure → decision to break silence. The piece leans heavily on summarized backstory (the great-grandmother’s exile, the century-long conspiracy) rather than dramatized present-tense friction, which flattens some potential turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise in Maren’s choice to act, with a clear before/after in her stance. Structure is linear and coherent, but an on-page obstacle at the end would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: pick-up → disappearance at the scaffold billboard → discovery of the glass → revelation → new mission. The structure is essentially one continuous window with embedded flashback, and the transitions (gas station, tunnel, pullout) are legible and motivated. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/RR: she reinterprets both the hitchhiker’s act and her own long-standing practice with a clear before/after. The cost is quiet but present—she accepts a lifetime obligation and an unsettling knowledge—though not pushed as hard as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal line is clean: acquisition threat → walk to circus site → philosophical framing of “territory” → proposed alternative strategy → joint commitment to dissuade others. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change: they haven’t yet fought the investors, but their stance and plan are crystallized with discernible cost (forgoing a “clean” bailout). Structure is simple but apt—a single continuous scene with backstory interleaved and anchored cleanly in the present. The stakes remain mostly conceptual/identity-level; a more concrete on-page consequence (e.g., resisted temptation or immediate loss) would deepen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: telegram → ascent to observatory → watching the stars → realization about the temples → decision to share the burden, with clear orientation throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: temples shift from “prayers” to observatories, and solitary scholarship reconfigures into communal responsibility. However, causal pressure is mild; nothing seriously resists or complicates her trajectory from initial summons to final resolve, so the arc feels more like an elegant essay than a fully dramatized story.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal structure is clean: a prior failed spell creates the ice dome and curse, and the present scene methodically undoes it via the expanding-circle ritual and the planted seed. The drive is Causal with a quiet RR: he moves from shame-bound stasis to an earned, reconfigured acceptance as the lake shifts from vortex to still pool. Closure lands clearly—the curse is lifted, the seed is working, and his self-understanding has altered with visible conceptual cost (reputation lost, responsibility kept). The simplicity of the task (no real risk of re-failure or interference) constrains the structural tension but not the legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: gardeners’ gift → contemplation and covenant context → eclipse intensification → planting the clipping → metaphysical expansion, with no orientation issues. Closure is strong: planting the clipping produces an on-page decisive transformation as she becomes the bridge. The cost—submerging her individuality into a larger network—is legible but not sharply stressed, keeping the arc more ceremonial than pressurized. Still, the before/after boundary is clear and satisfying for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: oracle → burned tarot card → descent into catacombs → arrival at the golden-apple tree → apparition → completion of the bargain. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with one tightening: the move from general orchard to the heart-tree where the bartering happens and the sister appears. Closure is strong and legible: the card falls, the Hanged Man completes its arc, the sister is woven into the orchard, and Elara walks back changed, with the price on the page. Stakes and rules (trade something permanent to bring her sister into the in-between) stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: televised failure → retreat into safe appraisal work → message about the amp from his past → internal wrestle → decision to go to Elko. The piece holds a Situational/Causal hybrid lens, with pressure escalating as present details reweight his history rather than through external events. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: he commits to the trip, with the cost (reopening grief) legible. Structure is linear and contained; no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene anchored by a clear quest frame and interleaved backstory that consistently points toward the arbor and seed. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: reading the tablets → making the journey → finding and handling the seed → receiving the civilization’s knowledge → conceptual repricing of her ambition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, with the cost being her relinquished need for echoing fame. The only limitation is that the middle portion leans heavily on exposition, so escalation feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent and clearly accumulative: daily routine → smelting days → reaffirmation of the cycle. However, there is almost no narrative turn; what we understand in paragraph one (this is what Asa does, and it matters) is essentially what we end with, only restated. Closure lands as a gentle resonance—an Earned Stasis affirmation of purpose—rather than a reconfiguration with cost. For elite markets, the absence of a sharper before/after limits impact despite the elegant design.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: inspection → discovery of collapse → descent → reading shells → realization → decision to take the pearl and redirect the shells’ fate. The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive, deepening meaning rather than stacking events, and lands a clear conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is present: Margret has a new mission that redefines her role, with the facility sealed but the confessions liberated. The cost is mostly conceptual and professional rather than dramatically tested, which limits the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: travel to station → entry into bathroom → encounter with graffiti → reconfiguration of her understanding of her breakdown and persistence. Causality is modest but coherent (maps → station → graffiti → new stance), and the ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after in how she interprets her “flooding” mind, though the journey to that realization is more told through reflection than dramatized through on-page choice under pressure. A slightly more concrete external hinge or micro-crisis would sharpen escalation and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: letter → observation of anomalies → deeper into the library → discovery of the door → second letter and watch’s silence. Causality holds and the pattern of time-folding and documentation is coherent, culminating in a conceptual repricing that “endings are beginnings spoken backward.” However, the declared clock (“before the watch stops”) never bites with real pressure, and her success feels largely unopposed and inevitable. Closure is present and legible, but the cost of that closure is mostly conceptual, not dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with embedded backstory (countess, missionary) that always orients back to the present decision. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with the provenance gaps, visions, and plant-voices layering pressure onto the core choice. Closure lands via a Charged Poise/RR when she plays the first note and the “perforated destiny” of her life conceptually reconfigures her options. The cost and exact path forward remain a touch abstract, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: enter grotto → perceive liminal soul → work with chip → capture spark → depart with charged object. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after in the spark’s state and in Mira’s custodianship. However, the progression feels more like a continuous ritual than a scene with a meaningful turn or tightening; nothing ever really threatens to break the chain of beats beyond a lightly-declared “threatened to fade.” A touch more jeopardy or complication in the middle would deepen the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: present-time unease → backstory of betrayal/forgiveness → accumulation of tree-climbing as a method → scallop-cloud observation → climactic ascent and realization → return to tending. Causality works under an accumulative/textural lens, with the scallop pattern and increased height of the climb serving as a meaningful tightening that leads to the conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing of “contentment,” with a before/after that’s easy to trace. Stakes remain low-key and almost entirely internal, so while the structure is sound, the narrative never quite feels urgent enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single reflective dawn scene anchored by the lighthouse and one summarized prior session, with causal logic intact. The drive lens is accumulative/textural—details of her tools and methods build toward a quiet re-commitment to her role. Closure arrives as a charged poise/earned stasis: she reaffirms her stance as a conscience-for-hire as “something new” approaches. The lack of a sharper present-time turn or visible price keeps the structural impact more contemplative than truly consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly circular and accumulative: each ring brings a deeper revelation, culminating in Mina’s conceptual reconfiguration and choice to begin the pattern herself. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what she wants), and the piece maintains a single, continuous scene with no lens confusion. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when “vanishing” is reframed and Mina steps into the teacher role. The cost is largely conceptual (a life devoted to this process), which is legible if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: the daily ritual, pulse, birds, and arrowhead build toward a quiet reconfiguration of “navigation” at the end. Orientation is clean and the one-scene structure is coherent; backstory is interleaved via the arrowhead and canyon without disorienting. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final paragraph—“true navigation was not about the movement of the body…”—which clearly reframes the premise, though it largely confirms what the preceding text has already suggested. Because there’s no clear tightening or shift in options, the ending feels more like elegant restatement than a fully climactic turn, keeping this out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: drone arrival → keystone handling → ward failure → mist incursion → mist walking → arrival at the garden and completion of the folly. Structure is tight for a single-POV, single-throughline scene with one major transition, and the closure (conceptual repricing of her life and work) lands clearly. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and there are no orientation issues. Cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatic, which keeps the structural success from feeling fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: long-term quest → discovered ship → three-year ritual visits → this night’s lantern/meteor event → conceptual shift. Orientation is strong from the opening and never slips, and the low-tide constraint plus the recurring visits give a subtle but coherent narrative spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the same quest is reweighted from “finding” to “receiving,” with his life’s pattern reinterpreted in light of that. The cost—years of searching, his solitude, the relinquishing of control—is implicit but legible in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory, moving from setup (deck, coins, method) through a listening attempt to an interior reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Kira’s purpose. Causality is light but coherent (coins + static → perception of pattern → realization), with no orientation issues. The main weakness is the low sense of constraint or consequence; nothing in the present moment would read differently if she failed to realize this purpose now.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: discovery of the box → interruption of her task → listening to instructions → applying them to her own grief → leaving with a changed stance. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she walks into the dusk “not afraid,” newly equipped to carry grief. Causality is coherent and orientation is clear from early on; the observatory frame never wavers. The one constraint is that pressure and cost at the end are more implied than sharply dramatized as a fork in possible futures.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: broken bell → vanished fish → mage’s realization about dripping water → sustained repair → restored abundance. Closure is unambiguous and on-page, with a before/after shift for both bell and village. The piece does compress potential resistance—there’s no serious on-page setback or risk that the method might fail—which keeps the structure from feeling fully tested. Still, for this length, the single problem-solution arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous night of inspection with embedded memories, culminating in her clarified role as memory-keeper—a solid accumulative/textural drive. Causal flow is clear (drought → resurfacing → her inspection → photographs as trail → final stance), and closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing of what her work means. The backstory is well-anchored to present stimuli (photos, label, foundations) and doesn’t obscure orientation. Escalation in a causal sense is modest rather than sharp, which holds this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous ritual-like scene that deepens from observation to realization, culminating in a clear conceptual reconfiguration (she realizes she has been the crystal). Causality is simple but coherent: decades of study → present moment of balance → revelation via birds and flame → transformation. Closure lands: the narrative before/after is legible, and the cost is an internal undoing of her old identity rather than an external consequence. The main limitation is that the “everything will crumble into ash” stake is never concretely tested, so the climax reads more contemplative than truly perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: prolonged radio silence → weather shift → revised calculations → heading adjustment → safe emergence, all under a coherent hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: he has carried the burden one more night and recommits to watching, with the “parachute buckle” tension released. Cost is present but subtle—emotional strain rather than a concrete loss—which slightly softens the impact. Structure is straightforward but solid for the length, with no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: return to dojo → confrontation with clone → invocation of “Vivify” and knife use → shared awakening and reframed relationship. Backstory (legal custody, prior training, ego death) is efficiently woven in and clearly tilts the present choice without derailing the scene. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they are no longer “original vs duplicate” but complementary halves, with a legible before/after and conceptual cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with thematic reflection layered on and holds steady through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent, with a clear inciting incident (the mysterious seed) and a steady accumulative build toward the conceptual repricing at the end. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: months passing, design changes, and reflection all deepen one thematic stake. Closure is solid—she reinterprets the seed’s purpose, accepting a new stance on innovation—but the story avoids concrete turning points or reversals, so the plot feels more like an essayistic meditation than a pressured arc. Causality is intact, yet the absence of a live, on-page decision undercuts narrative sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, and it succeeds in sustaining one ritual action through a continuous scene. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the sense that his work continues indefinitely “until the laughter returned,” which reweights the ritual with ongoing cost. However, structurally the middle reiterates the same move—pull, sound, metaphor—without a strong internal pivot or fresh layer of pressure. The “world after the final grain slips through the hourglass” is intriguing but doesn’t concretely alter options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clear: pendant appears → she uses learned method → re-sees the garden → chooses to cross the threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the garden’s role is conceptually repriced from prison to generous threshold, with a clear before/after. Causality holds within the chosen mode; there are no orientation problems and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable. The cost of her shift—abandoning a 17-winter vigil and identity—is implied but somewhat softly rendered rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: years of failed attempts → present experiment at the nexus → recognition that the embers need subtraction, not fuel → decisive act of breaking the crozier → release and closure. The single-scene structure with embedded backstory is coherent and lands a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration (she forfeits the relic and the destiny attached to it). Stakes are somewhat abstracted (“stifling destiny,” “interrupt destiny”) and the present-time opposition is mostly conceptual rather than actively resisting, which keeps this just below the top tier. Still, the closure moment is legible and carries a concrete cost in surrendering the relic and her former calling.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb and setup → anomaly (geometric silence) → methodological shift → revelation → descent and reflection. Causality holds under a textural lens—her decision to treat the silence as invitation directly leads to the transformative experience, and lunar perigee plus the fragment frame a clear window that opens and closes. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her understanding of beginnings and endings is reweighted, with a before/after that’s legible. The cost is mostly implied as a lifelong reorientation rather than dramatized in a sharp final choice, which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: strange commute → rising radio interference → realization of an impending merge → Maren’s decision to stand at the nexus → post-merge denouement. Causality holds under a situational/accumulative lens, and the closure—world slightly more solid, her role accepted—is an on-page resonant reconfiguration. The major weakness is that the dangerous merging of timelines is mostly told rather than dramatized; the instability (passengers “dissolve at the edges”) never directly threatens a specific, concrete moment of failure on the page. Still, the story resolves its central situation without cheats or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with one continuous build: preparation → weaving → eruption → contemplative aftermath. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the “eruption” of hum and glowing threads functions as the key deepening, and the final acceptance of blurred memories provides a quiet but legible resonant reconfiguration. Causality is coherent—her weaving leads to the gallery’s response—without teleports or rule-breaking. The closure is conceptually strong but remains more atmospheric than decisively choice-driven, which keeps it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night of work culminating in the news of the visitors’ departure and a reframed mission for Mira. Causality is modest but coherent—her calculations and the aliens’ prior teaching set up her conceptual turn at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cosmos redefined as a navigable sea they must now sail alone, with the departure as inflection. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: client’s request → technical investigation → discovery of Margot’s message → Elena’s decision to run into the misted atrium, culminating in a conceptual closure about what it means to “trace” threads. The structure—a present-time case framed by Elena’s established routine—fits the length and keeps orientation clear. However, some pivotal beats are under-specified: “Margot was dead” is asserted though the disappearance is three weeks old, and the nature of the “message” waiting where Margot last stood is vague (physical? auditory? trace?), which blurs the concrete outcome. The closure still lands conceptually, but with a slight sense of elision around what exactly Elena finds and how it changes Vera’s situation in practical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is strong: mission → exploration → codex contact → revelation of cable-voices → invitation → choice to join. Closure is solid—a decisive transformation plus a conceptual re-framing of the ocean as a library, with the cost of abandoning her old life implicit. The six-hour tidal constraint is set up as a major structural pressure but never meaningfully re-enters the decision calculus, softening the sense of narrowing options. Still, for this length, the single-scene structure is coherent and the progression legible.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single present ritual in the observatory interwoven with backstory, culminating in the ghost’s final transmission and Mira’s inner reconfiguration. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each layer of world and history builds toward the closure beat where her stance toward the architect changes and she lets her heartbeat “count itself.” Causality is soft but coherent: the defragmentation ritual leads to the ghost’s rest and her conceptual shift, with no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move steadily from canyon rim to tunnel mouth, with the density of echoes, birds, and curse all converging on the climax where a new language is born. Causality is soft but legible—decades of listening → arrival at last speakers’ vigil → descent with charged diamond → spoken bridge that transforms curse and speech. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, but the cost of this transformation (what she or the world truly loses beyond the abstract “death of a language”) is sketched rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: phone → garden exploration → creature’s emergence → realization/step forward, with causal links that are easy to follow. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mira reconceives the “cryptid” and the research as a metamorphosis of science itself—which lands, but the on-page cost of that shift is muted. Backstory (Amari’s undercover work and academic mockery) is integrated without derailing momentum. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with light causality, and that choice holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: journey across bridges → discovery of shell → awakening of statues → passage through orchard → central arch and release of the shell. Causality reads as accumulative/textural rather than plotty, but each step follows intelligibly from the last, and the closure—Elara’s entry into the orchard’s heart and relinquishing of the shell—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The dominant stake (can living beauty/music be rekindled in a mechanical world?) is followed through to a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the price of her transformation is only lightly implied, so the structural turn at the end is more luminous than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mail drop → encounter with Aram → decision to smuggle medicine and storm → reaffirmation of purpose as he heads for the fence. The piece achieves closure via a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus reinterprets his role and the border itself, with the storm bottle flashing as a charged final image. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with backstory (Elena and her sister, the scientist) efficiently folded into the present. Escalation is modest—danger and consequences remain mostly implied—keeping it below a truly peak-pressured structure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: bells → wrong turn → hidden oasis → halo fragment → acceptance of a new calling, all under an accumulative/lyric lens. Causality is soft but coherent, with the bells serving as the hinge that leads him into the impossible space and back again with a new object and purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his life of static making is reweighted by the discovery of an explicitly sacred fragment and a future carousel. The main limitation is that the cost of this change remains mostly conceptual; nothing in his circumstances is sharply foreclosed or risked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean and legible: scarf appears → Miriam decides to act → ritual in the geometric heart → woman returns for the reawakened object. Structure is essentially a single accumulating scene with embedded reflection, and the closure (restored analog memory) is clear. However, escalation is gentle and the outcome feels foregone; there is no real possibility of failure or surprise turn. The closure has conceptual weight but only modest narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: claim of the library → discovery of the palette → experiments with the dead → encounter with the runaway dream → capture and hanging of the photograph. Causality holds and the magical rules are tightly inferred (palette + sunrise + sequence of pigments → momentary vitality and exposure of longing). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira finally sees and contains her own lifelong yearning. Stakes remain almost entirely internal and textural, with no strong external pressure, which limits escalation but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, when, and her purpose are all quickly legible), and the causal chain—star → garden → fountain → hidden chamber → sentence—holds without gaps. The drive is basically causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the philosopher’s sentence reframes the entire quest. The cost (seventeen years of waiting and doubt) is clear, though most of that cost is off-page and the on-page night’s work offers little structural complication or reversal. The structure—a single continuous arrival-to-discovery scene with embedded backstory—is coherent and proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → descent and contact with the ring → memory retrieval → reorientation toward future expeditions. Causality under a primarily accumulative lens is solid: his long study leads to method, which leads to the Heron’s reassembly, which triggers the returned memories and the reconfiguration of his stance. The barons/1952 backstory is dense but anchored and doesn’t break the drive or closure, though the lack of any concrete obstacle in the present makes the progression feel more like a ritual fulfillment than an escalating test.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: Maren alone in the library, the children’s arrival, the careful distance, tea ritual, and the small but decisive shift when the boy drinks. Causality is subtle but present—her stance and the tea ritual create conditions for the children’s tentative trust—while the “reversible exile” frame coherently binds backstory and present. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s action and Maren’s acknowledgement mark a before/after in their exile-from-belonging, with a cost implied in the fragility of that trust. The only limitation is that the structural turn is very soft, relying on interpretation rather than a more sharply dramatized decision.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: pruning → contemplating the seed → planting it, with a clear before/after in the orchard’s charge. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when the seed is planted and framed as covenant. Causality is intact, but the lack of complication or disruption makes the arc feel more like a ceremony than a story under competitive-market standards. The cost of the choice (or its risks) is only lightly implied, so the ending’s reconfiguration is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—net arrives → explanation of binding → decision to unravel → progressive untying → revelation at the last knots → release—reads clean and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s understanding of sanctuary, masks, and binding is reweighted by the unmasking of the spirit and her own reflection. Cost is legible in the breaking of the long-guarded practice and the shattering of accumulated silence. The only limit is that external stakes remain contained to this ritual night, so the structural arc feels elegant rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine—archival discovery → site visit → descent → film comparison → ethical decision—is clean and easy to follow in a single-POV, single-location frame. The accumulative/textural drive (building pattern around thresholds, silence, and reopening) holds to the end, and the closure as a quiet renunciation/charged poise is legible. Stakes remain modest and largely conceptual, and there’s no pronounced structural tightening beyond the reveal of the doorway outline. Still, for a lyric piece, the structure is coherent and adequately shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single descent framed by concise backstory (Earhart, the Montserrat) that all feeds directly into the present discovery. Causality is clear—her earlier success and lingering ache lead to this secret expedition, which leads to the globe, the note, and the new quest. Closure lands as a conceptual and motivational shift rather than a physical turn, but the before/after is legible and carries cost in what it suggests about her relationship to the ocean. The accumulative drive holds throughout, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is essentially one continuous scene with embedded backstory, under an accumulative/textural lens: each paragraph deepens the premise rather than driving a clear causal arc. Causality is clean (ghost calls → Mira listens/encodes → they finally duet) and spatial/temporal orientation (courtyard above clouds, lightning intervals) is clear early, so there’s no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: their joint song and encoding at a charged moment reframes Mira’s “seldom-heard” status into a larger transmission, though the shift is conceptual more than decisively plot-driven. The scene doesn’t feature a sharp turn so much as a steady swell, but the final cadence is legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: one elevator ride framed as a continuous ascent, discovery → reading → understanding → decision → arrival. Causality is clear at every step, and the accumulative/textural drive (light increasing, cipher resolving, emotional knowledge deepening) holds through closure. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (she exits having silently accepted a new relational burden) with a legible, if quiet, cost. Escalation is more gentle deepening than sharp turn, which keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and each observational pass over the sky deepens the emotional and conceptual stakes. Causality is modest but coherent: the accident leads to her retreat to the gondola, which leads to a new way of observing, which culminates in her decision to memorialize and reconceive “broken” strings. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes absence and chooses a path forward in her work and mourning with visible emotional cost. The piece is more meditative than event-driven, so the sense of plot turn is quiet rather than sharply punctuated.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: commission → search → discovery of the safe → coin → ceiling mural → demolition. The piece reads primarily as accumulative/textural, with closure arriving as a conceptual repricing of preservation vs. transformation when the building falls and her work becomes a different kind of survival. Cost is legible in the loss of the library and the translation of its meaning into another form, though the emotional impact could be sharpened. Structure is contained and coherent within the one-night frame.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the birds → tracking their behavior → seeing the luminance → discovering the hopscotch board → conceptualizing a navigational principle, all within one continuous window. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the piece lands a quiet closure via Mira’s decision to bring her findings to Thresh and her sense of having crossed a personal threshold. The primary weakness is the low-stakes, low-friction progression—no beat substantially complicates or threatens her goal. The closure is more conceptual than costly, which slightly mutes impact for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: library search → descent to hall → offering → passage through the opened mirror. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with prophecy and gears seeding and then enabling the final turn. Closure is on-page: the mirror opens and Thessa steps into a new role, a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the path feels pre-ordained and untroubled—no real uncertainty or complication tests the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine—Mira intensifies, chalk messages accumulate, community investigates, restores, rings bell—is clean and legible. The accumulative structure suits the piece: pressure is textural rather than confrontational, leading to a clear before/after when the bell summons rain. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the community reorients from mere survival to shared tending, with the final image consolidating that. Cost is conceptually present (time and effort diverted from survival), but mostly implied rather than dramatized as a difficult trade-off, which keeps the arc from feeling fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, cohering around the approach of time’s final ripple and culminating in the single soft chime. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she completes the final adjustment and the universe holds its breath, with the cost—total ending—clearly present. Structure is clean (single scene, one through-line), but escalation is gentle, with few concrete turns beyond “preparation → adjustment → chime.” The drive is coherent, just not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clear and clean: birds signal intruders → blueprint and heartseed offer a potential solution → time pressure from the coming frost → key placed, mechanism opens, path revealed. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence; who/where/what is going on is never in doubt despite the layered worldbuilding. Closure lands through a decisive physical act with conceptual weight—using the inherited tools to guide others—though the cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized. Structure is linear, coherent, and satisfying, if a bit straightforward in its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure—a single present scene braided with backstory and reflection—reads clean and coherent, and the causal chain (past choice → guilt → summons from sister → journey → on-site realization) is easy to follow. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with the river and foam leading organically into the conceptual repricing of her “divergent path.” Closure lands: by the end, her relationship to her past choice and her grief has materially shifted. The main limitation is that the insight feels more like a gentle, anticipated arrival than a pressured or surprising structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → exploration → discovery of the special shelf → conceptual reframing provides a clean CR-style closure. Causality is soft but legible—her prior experience selling slates motivates her method, which in turn motivates her reading of the library. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains stable, and the throughline of “understanding her purpose” holds. The main limitation is low on-page cost; the closure is intellectually tidy more than dramatically tight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → revelation of how the pavilion works → overwhelming first touch → three-day ritual of cooking and contact → emergence with a reweighted relationship to sorrow. Causality is intact and legible under a textural lens; each phase follows naturally from the last, and the three-day compression reads as purposeful montage rather than hand‑wave. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pavilion’s nature is unchanged but gentled, and Miriam’s stance toward sorrow is clarified with an on-page price. Stakes could be made more acute by more explicitly dramatizing the possibility of failure or true subsumption, but the piece still feels structurally complete.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—finding the weight → seeking Antonescu → involving his brother’s family → repairing clock and community—reads cleanly and resolves in a satisfying closure when the clock chimes again. The drive lens is predominantly causal with a thematic overlay, and the before/after (silent vs. chiming tower; divided vs. tentatively allied families) is legible with conceptual and social cost. Some major beats (“The work took weeks…”) are telescoped rather than dramatized, which blunts immediacy but not coherence. Overall structure is strong and self-contained at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: canyon walk → discovery of the mirror → influx of memories → decision and all-night modification → new role. The piece lands a real closure beat (she is “fundamentally different” and begins her work), so the macro-arc is intact. However, the critical middle—“She worked through the night…”—is summarized without obstacles, reversals, or specific choices that would make the transformation feel costly or contested. As a result, the structure reads more like a graceful fable than a pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous descent (ascent) into the grotto, anchored by the inversion window and the prior failed attempt, with a clear before/after in her understanding of the combinations. Causality is coherent—her long obsession leads to returning at inversion, choosing a passage, and activating the markings—and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing of what “combinations” and knowledge mean. However, the central challenge resolves with minimal friction, and the hour-long constraint never forces a hard, time-pressured trade-off. The ending is satisfying but not sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: find insulator → interpret cracks → build hybrid instrument → play → grove responds, all in one coherent scene with no orientation debt. As an accumulative/textural design, it builds mood and concept well and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when music returns and a bird sings. However, closure lacks a tangible price; her success comes without setback or trade-off, so the before/after is more tonal than consequential. The causality holds, but the stakes feel gently reweighted rather than truly changed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene at the nexus braided with backstory, converging on a reflective closure where he reaccepts his purpose in exile. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated returns to the nexus and eclipse imagery build toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Causality is simple but coherent—sentence, exile, ritual visit, reframed purpose. The main limitation is that the “before/after” shift at the end is subtle and mostly conceptual, with limited sense of narrowed options or heightened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: problem (jammed clasp) → attempts via resonator → fireworks as external pressure → discovery of the right note → conceptual shift about empathy and silence. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure (conceptual repricing of celebration’s aftermath) is clear and on-page. However, the stakes remain fairly small and interior, and the resolution comes quickly once the note is heard, with little sense that failure was a real possibility. The diary nearly being lost is told rather than dramatized as an escalating constraint, softening the impact of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → assignment with corpse flower → extended tending period → bloom and conceptual shift, with time handled via efficient summary. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each phase deepens the central task rather than introducing new threads. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: Kalia’s understanding of decay, wisdom, and her own ambition shifts on the page with the final journaling image. The main limitation is that the central “exam” never feels in doubt; we’re told of struggle more than shown decisive crossroads.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous resonance → timed descent during inversion → following water flows → discovery of the arrow → revelation via echoes → choice to preserve the secret. The single continuous scene fits the length and the “hour of inversion” provides a natural structural frame and soft ticking clock. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Cora chooses knowledge-with-restraint over exploitation, reweighting what “resilience” means. Stakes remain a bit conceptual (no direct, concrete threat to her or others), which keeps the sense of cost somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: arrive in the evacuated port, move through the container maze, locate the convergence point, reframe the prior disaster and evacuation, and end with a renewed survey. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: methodical measurement → pattern recognition → conceptual repricing of “accident.” Closure lands via her realization that the evacuation was foresight, not panic, and that “accidents” are structured. Escalation is more intellectual than situational, so the sense of narrowing options remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: single primary scene in the ice cathedral with a brief, legible cutaway to the sculptor that reinforces simultaneity and theme. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from hush to symphonic explosion to global transmission is coherent and lands in a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is somewhat soft—failure is never a live option, and the ritual unfolds without complication—but the before/after of “wonder uncertified” to “wonder essential” is legible. Closure is on the page and functional, if a touch programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally coherent as a single, continuous scene with reflective layering anchored by specific physical actions (walking, marking, uncasing, sitting vigil). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: past failure → chosen hush journey → vigil → reframed understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what guardianship means, with Oresta’s ruin and her exile providing the cost. The main limitation is that the “turn” is more intellectual than situational, so the sense of narrowing options is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates coherently under an accumulative/textural drive: stars vanish, the halo fragment brightens, and Maren’s work and selfhood converge into light. Orientation is clean and the story builds to a legible Conceptual Repricing: consciousness as transcribable math in a starless universe. However, escalation is largely conceptual rather than dramatized; the plot lacks a concrete hinge where options narrow or a choice alters the path. Closure lands, but its cost is more implied than felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean early: we know who Elara is, where she is, and what she’s doing by the end of the first paragraph. The structure is straightforward—climb, activate pendant, encounter Mira, receive reframing, resolve—and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost (relinquishing the “abandoned” narrative). Causality is simple but intact: pendant activation → Mira’s appearance → explanation → Elara’s new stance. The main limitation is that the pressure never really threatens to derail or complicate the encounter; the arc flows smoothly rather than under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses a clean single-scene structure with integrated reflection, oriented early (Mira, the arbor, the car, winter morning) and held steadily. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds through successive passes over the frost and memory, cresting in the realization that Mira herself is an “object” in the emotional library. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the premise—observer → participant—with a clear before/after and implied cost. Stakes remain largely internal, but they are coherent and the final beat (“conversation…with the dead all along”) reconfigures the frame without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (quiet setup → intensifying raveling silence → recognition of cost → transformation) is clean and coherent, with a clear before/after anchored in her becoming the message. Causality holds: her lifelong collection of puzzle edges and the bead lead directly to the possibility of sending the message, which in turn necessitates self-unraveling. Closure lands solidly with conceptual and emotional cost in the empty, humming loom and vanished bead. What keeps this just under elite tier is the lack of a strong mid-story turn or complication; the path from work to sacrifice is relatively linear.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—from planetary blight to Cael’s rediscovery of the Magician’s Silk to his tunnel work and the eventual surfacing blossoms—is clear and satisfying. The piece uses a mostly linear structure with embedded backstory that never confuses orientation and lands in an Earned Stasis/RR ending where Cael’s ongoing labor and chosen anonymity feel like a real cost. The main limitation is that some key beats (the hardest work, the deepest discoveries) are summarized rather than dramatized moment-to-moment, which slightly blunts their structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with an accumulative/casual hybrid drive: climb, activation, vision, repricing, descent. Orientation is solid early, and all the speculative elements cohere without rule-breaking or retroactive patches. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she doesn’t alter the multiverse but redefines her role in it, with a clear before/after. The cost—accepting an unhealed wound and endless liminality—could be made more concrete, but it is legible enough to satisfy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: dark lamp → evacuation → stone stacks → revelation of anonymous tradition and ship graveyard → Maren’s ritual act → light restored. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the single-scene structure with brief backstory interleaving supports the throughline. The closure—a decisive change in the world state and Maren’s role—is on-page and legible with emotional cost (letting go of her grandmother’s unresolved presence). The only softness is how quickly Maren “immediately” grasps what is needed, which trims some potential struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: tend the lantern → summon light → foresee/steer three ships → complete the ritual, with a coherent, continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his ongoing task is framed as chosen burden in a forgotten world, with the sky’s “smile” echoing his laughter. Yet there is no strong on-page turn where options narrow or knowledge changes; the narrative mostly confirms what we’re told from the outset. Cost at closure (isolation, endless duty) is conceptual rather than dramatized in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: tea house and wing in the present, then layered reflections (grandmother, traveler, donor) culminate in a conceptual shift about story-magnetizing. Causality operates via observation → association → realization, and the closure (his new role as receiver and vessel) is legible and earned. The story’s pressure remains low-stakes and inward, and the decisive change is more notional than dramatized, which softens the sense of cost. Still, the before/after in his understanding and purpose is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: present-tense climb and observation, integrated backstory of the astronomer and the sextant, then a focused night of mapping culminating in the morning descent to act. Causality is soft but coherent: the storm, moonlight, and accumulated sorrow lead to this night’s decision to “deconstruct the labyrinth’s pattern” and then physically follow what she has seen. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: maintaining is reframed as a kind of deliberate unmaking grounded in quantified sorrow. The cost and stakes are implied rather than dramatized in a concrete, scene-level consequence, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: tending the greenhouse → ritual swaddling and song → destabilization of reality → sacrificial dawn and reconfiguration. Cause-and-effect within the lyric frame holds: her actions with the memory-cloth and chant trigger the tremors, refractions, and eventual shattering. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in both world-state and her role, and the cost is legible. The only limitation is that the larger world’s mechanics (mirror cracks, stolen light) remain suggestive rather than fully dramatized, keeping the scope slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene frame (late night in the hidden library) woven with reflection on the invitation and her past, oriented clearly from the opening. Causality runs quietly but coherently: the invitation → avoidance in the library → slow thematic reconciling → decision to reply. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she has not yet gone, but the choice and its cost are crystallized. Escalation is more accumulative than sharply turned, which slightly softens structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: daily maintenance → discovery of the bread → ritual acceptance → butterfly emergence → reaffirmed commitment forms a coherent arc. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she consciously recommits to slow restoration under the weight of ongoing decay and tenuous absolution. Causality is subtle but intact—the bread and butterfly both reweight her ongoing work rather than introduce new threads. The main ceiling comes from relatively low felt cost at the end; the “before/after” is more tonal than decisively configurational.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: we move from routine measurement under looming loss to a surprising discovery and then a reframed mission. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres around approaching oblivion and the narrowing window “tonight” provides. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: magic → story, preservation of power → preservation of meaning, with the clear cost of accepting the end of the vows’ original form. The causal chain is straightforward and intact, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene braced by concise backstory, moving toward the rendezvous and closing on a charged choice-point. The causal chain from bottled messages to repeated failed meetings to this final encounter is coherent and supports a situational/accumulative lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise rather than a decisive act—the before/after is her realization that keeping the fob has its own active cost—but the external consequences of either option remain abstract. A slightly clearer articulation of what “answers” might concretely disrupt would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene that accumulates pressure around the convergence and Seren’s arrival, leading to a clear conceptual reweighting at the end. Causality is soft but intact: the ring’s behavior, the aurora’s intensification, and Seren’s entrance all line up under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is present in Mira’s reframed stance toward truth, though the stakes remain largely philosophical with minimal felt consequence. There are no orientation issues, but the story skirts the edge of being more mood-piece than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: descent → discovery of the chamber → confrontation with the unfinished canvas → decision to begin. Causality is soft but coherent (lock and coordinates → cave → painting), and the ending lands as a Charged Poise/RR where her stance toward her creativity is reconfigured with visible cost (acknowledging her role in Elena’s suppression). The stakes remain largely interior and conceptual, but they are legible and consistent. A slightly sharper on-page beat where she almost refuses to engage the canvas would heighten the sense of a before/after turn.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: zinc plate and map → investigation → coordinates → journey → hidden letter-room → decision to continue the work, with a clear before/after in Mira’s understanding of her师傅 and honesty. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never confusing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the room’s meaning shifts from secret cache to living garden of truth when she begins to write. The main weakness is that the structural arc is almost purely investigative with no significant complication or reversal once the trail is found.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric drive, building from present work on the sculpture through backstory and world context to a quiet closure where “the fragment held its color” and her seasonal arc is projected forward. Causality is soft but coherent: her lifelong practice leads naturally to this ambitious piece, which then “speaks” to the valleys below. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis rather than a decisive turn, but the before/after (unfinished vs. finished/tuned work) is legible with a modest emotional cost of vigilance and lifelong tending. The lack of a stronger on-page turn or new constraint at the end keeps it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clear: magnetic shift → corrupted regulators → dying roses → unbearable static → decision to attempt a “controlled burn” using the fear box. The story maintains one clean scene with interleaved backstory that always tilts present action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Cara absorbs and miniaturizes chaos, the dome survives, she emerges altered and lighter. The cost—her fragmentation and the permanent carrying of miniaturized fears—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine (curiosity about the mailbox → conversation with Mrs. Okonkwo → discovery of letters and locket → off-page reunion → reconfigured role in the community) is clean and easy to follow. The story uses an accumulative/textural mode but still lands a clear closure unit with the unlocked, emptied mailbox and Elena’s reframed understanding of her work. Key climactic events (reading the letters, the reunion) are mostly summarized rather than scened, which softens impact and immediacy. Still, there is an evident before/after and a felt cost in the decades-long estrangement and belated healing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: years of coded planning → returning to the flooded lab → executing the dance sequence → the mechanism engages and the water drains → she walks into freedom. The backstory about regime, cure, and poison recipes is efficiently folded into the forward motion and clarifies why this escape matters beyond her individual survival. Closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost already paid (years voiceless, imprisoned) and reconfigured options (she’s now free and dangerous to the regime). The main limitation is that the actual “test” of the plan feels almost entirely pre-solved; in this scene, nothing threatens to derail causality or force an on-page adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: beaching of the whale → discovery/recognition of the memory crystals → descent into the chamber → approach to the mother’s crystal → closing realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the final image reweighting prior motifs without needing a literal reveal of the mother’s secret. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent; whale death freeing memories → salt crystals as repositories → Mira using coffee-ground maps to navigate. The main limitation is that the supposed “final confession” remains wholly off-page, so the piece leans on conceptual stakes rather than a concretely altered situation, slightly softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single-scene, accumulative/lyric structure: arrival at the brook → ritual of silence → revelation of the prophecy’s true nature → departure with a new stance. Causality is coherent under the textural lens: her choice to “smooth” the medium enables her to hear the prophecy differently, producing a before/after in understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—prophecy reframed as a future self’s plea, and the “future unwritten” for the court feels like an earned reconfiguration. The cost is subtle (relinquishing scripted certainty and accepting responsibility) and could be sharpened, but it is present.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: sugar → tea → lessons → rooftop interrogation, with each stage deepening the central question of who/what the tutor is and why Elena is here. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the pattern of returns (desk seal, language of buildings, agreed-upon lies) sets up a coherent drive lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elena chooses acceptance and sustained ambiguity, and the world (buildings/stars) responds, making a before/after legible. The only thing holding this just under 9+ is that the cost and stakes, while present, remain relatively quiet and conceptual rather than fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: object discovered → tested against skepticism → revelation of Elena’s fate and invention → decision to continue her work. The structure is essentially one continuous scene anchored in the garden, with backstory efficiently woven into the present-tense listening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of Mira’s worldview and mission, with a clear before/after. The only ceiling comes from the relatively soft external stakes—future quest seeded rather than pressured within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: Yuki arrives, is presented with the key and thorn, accesses the hidden texts, restores them, then chooses to leave with knowledge only, culminating in a conceptual repricing of treason and truth. Causality is soft but intact under a textural lens, and closure lands in her final realization about unlinking from complicity. The one structural wobble is the key that “no lock on earth will accept” ending up unused in a literal sense, which blurs its practical role even as it works metaphorically.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: past investigations lead her to this nexus on this night, the celestial alignment builds, the humming swells, and she steps into the heart of the song. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure beat functions as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing moment. The main limitation is that escalation remains largely anticipatory and conceptual; we don’t see a concrete option close or a decisive revelation land, only the poised attempt to hear. Cost at the end is implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: shrine → wreck and globe → dream investigation → resolved purpose to restore the child’s name and find her family. Causality is clean within a lyric mode, with the snow globe and recurring dream-face motivating her inquiry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the investigation has crystallized into a clear next step with moral weight, even if the decisive external act is deferred. The main limitation is that this feels like a prologue to a larger narrative rather than a self-contained arc with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: observation → reflection on nets/parents → return to the present → the act of whistling and its response → descent into morning readiness. Orientation is clear almost immediately (who, where, when, why she’s here), and there’s no causality break. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the whistle and fireflies crystallize the story’s pattern motifs and reweight her mending as reverence. The cost is subtle but legible in her self-aware “demure audacity” and acceptance of an identity others find strange.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: liquidation → cursed-diamond myth → orchard keeper’s reveal → letter reconstruction → scientific reinterpretation of the “curse” → transmission and quiet aftermath. The structure (present scene with embedded backstory of weeks of work) is legible and serves the conceptual turn without orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the stillpoint and diamond shift from mythic curse to instrument of truth, with an earned, reweighted final image. The main limitation is that the investigation’s middle phase is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page turning points and concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating pressure via storm, voices, and portico, with brief but well-anchored backstory. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/lyric lens: storm → intensifying voices → new prophetic line → portico cracking → prophet’s entrance. Closure is solid—a decisive arrival that clearly marks a before/after—though the cost and specific change in options are only lightly implied. Orientation is strong throughout; no lens or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly legible: a habitual-routine opening, a single inciting disruption (the music box), then a reflective time-jump that shows the long-term consequence, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is simple but intact—discovering and giving away the music box leads to a reconceived vocation, and the ending circles back through that lens. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: what he was “meant to collect” is redefined, with the cost (years of misdirected effort and lonesomeness) implied but present. The main limitation is that much of the second half is summarized outcome rather than dramatized beats, so the turn feels a bit essayistic rather than fully scened.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: worsening environmental pressure → crystal destabilizing → use of key and training to re-tune → stabilization. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence and never slips. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (harbor saved, crystal retuned) and an implicit ongoing cost of vigilance, though the success comes without much complication once she begins tuning. Structure fits the length and single-scene scope very well.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: long backstory of winters → discovery of the viaduct → method via moon paths → solstice unyoking is easy to follow. Under a textural lens, the closure counts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the landscape’s elements finally syncing. Yet causality is somewhat soft: the “revolution” arrives largely because the time has come, with little sense of what might have gone otherwise if Kira had chosen differently. Cost at closure is more implied than enacted, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Structure is clean: a single descent, discovery, revelation, and decision, with anchors of who/where/when established early and maintained. The causal chain broadly holds—drought → exposed skeleton → investigation → memory → decision to file/report with backups—yielding a legible before/after. The closure beat (filing the report and preparing copies) reads as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost. However, the entangled memories mechanic arrives late as a convenient shortcut to name, motive, and conspiracy, weakening the sense that the conclusion is earned through on-page investigation rather than a granted vision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: object arrives → assessment and doubt → reflection and reframing → repair plus inscription → return and musical payoff. The chosen drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with the decisive structural turn at “In that illumination, he understood what the clockwork heart required…”. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a dramatic decision, but the before/after—mere fixing vs. meaningful restoration—is legible. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized as a real risk, which slightly softens the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrow tip acquisition → experimentation with the kaleidoscope → discovery of the bell image → ringing it. Orientation is strong early—who, where, and the physical/logical frame of the world are quickly legible. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell is rung, the future is invoked, and the project shifts from quest to ongoing vocation. The main limitation is that the causal chain carries relatively low on-page cost, so the structural turn, while clear, lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from cold case → pattern of 47s → buried subdirectory → revelation about Prometheus → realization of Yuki-as-distributed-consciousness is coherent and satisfying. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the investigation mode holds cleanly under a causal drive lens. Closure lands as a charged poise moment—Maren begins tracing deleted files with an implied stance toward restoring Yuki—but the concrete costs and consequences (especially corporate blowback) are under-articulated. The case’s arrival “on a Thursday” and its handoff from the company is a slightly convenient setup but doesn’t break logic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean for a lyric-accumulative piece: lighthouse/orchard → appearance of the vintage store → mirror/fragment experience → realization → choice. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each image and reflection beat deepens the central drive toward clearer, costlier understanding, and closure lands in her decision to carry the fragment out with a new purpose. Stakes stay somewhat abstract and the “price” remains mostly conceptual, but we do get a legible before/after in how she sees her role as peacekeeper. One sharper on-page consequence of her choice would solidify the sense of structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: diagnosis → decision → volunteering in the north → final morning departure, all under a single, continuous lens. The accumulative drive (learning what endings are) coheres, and the closure beat reconfigures her stance from loose grip as disorientation to loose grip as prepared release. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation issues or arbitrary turns. The arc is intentionally quiet, so while there is a decisive closure, the sense of a tightening chain of “because/therefore” beats is modest rather than intense.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense evening in the vineyard framed around the departed bus, with one integrated block of backstory that directly informs the current stance. The accumulative drive is clear, building from observation to reflection to a quiet but definite reconfiguration at the end (“not for departures, but for…acceptance”). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR with legible cost. The piece is more meditative than event-driven, but within a lyric mode the causal and emotional throughline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous patrol culminating in the pavilion visit and a reaffirmation of her tending role, with the prophet and child as temporal bookends. Causality is soft but coherent—past consecrations and the prophet’s arrival justify her present ritual without breaking logic. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses to continue the same work with rearticulated meaning, but the before/after shift is conceptually subtle. Because there’s no concrete turn in options or stakes, the ending feels more like a beautiful loop than a structurally decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a single, coherent scene with an accumulative/textural drive: we move from arrival to the completion of work on one photograph and a reaffirmed mission. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, with Maren satisfied that “another piece of the puzzle had found its place,” but the before/after distinction is modest and largely conceptual. Causality is simple but clean—no orientation or logic breaks. The lack of a sharper turn or cost keeps the structure from feeling fully decisive at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene scaffolded by compact reflection, leading to a closure where Elias replaces the crystal and reconceives silence. Causality is accumulative—his decades of observation, use of the crystal, and the end of printing build toward the final realization. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost of his stance (what he gives up or forecloses) is implied more than felt. The drive lens as accumulative/textural is clear and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: goal (capture the sound) → traversal of the garden via markers → arrival at the fountain → auditory revelation and repriced understanding. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, and closure lands via conceptual repricing of what “growing older” sounds like and what her gift is for. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong from the opening. The cost is mostly emotional and retrospective, but it is legible in the weeks of restless searching and the tidal longing that finally settles.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: observatory + spinning hand + tremor build toward a single reconfiguration of what “repair” and “capture” mean. Orientation is clear early and never in doubt, and the father-clock promise threads causally into the present choice to photograph instead of halt the hand. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis with visible emotional cost (accepting the hand’s endless motion and the father’s likely permanent absence). A touch more on-page testing of the new stance (e.g., a concrete post-choice consequence) would push it into fully exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: diagnosis → hospice visit → musical ritual → quiet closure, all in one continuous scene with clear anchors. The drive lens feels largely accumulative/textural, with objects and sensations layering toward a resonant final recognition. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR when Margery names what Elara is doing and they share a crystallized moment, with mortality and method reweighted. Escalation is subtle to a fault—there is little sense of narrowing options or new complications, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: assignment → search in archives → discovery of key → experiment with loops → revelation and restored noon shadow. Drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a conceptual repricing closure (what shadows are/where they go is redefined). Closure is on-page and coherent but low-stakes: the world’s understanding shifts, yet no concrete consequence or hard choice tests the new knowledge. Structure is linear and contained to one evening in the observatory, with no orientation debt or glaring unkept setups, but the “tool for closing loops” arrives as a convenient perfect match rather than a pressured, problem-forged solution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by a clear inciting event (the substitute body at the ministry) and culminating in the garden ritual and inner reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each reflection is anchored in a concrete present cue and tilts her stance toward the final act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from treating the matter as an unfinished problem to an enduring fracture she can live with and forgive herself inside. Stakes and cost (accepting permanent uncertainty and relinquishing the ministry’s tidy “resolution”) are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: daily routine → disruptive object (the pearl) → revaluation of her past → transformation of the grotto and her role. Causality is coherent and the closure (reframing her “fall” as a call to a different radiance) lands clearly as a conceptual repricing. That said, the pearl’s arrival is a strong coincidence that largely solves the core problem rather than first complicating or deepening it, and the “weeks that followed” summary distances us from the climactic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: a present-time frame in the data center interwoven with one core backstory scene (the hospital confession) and clear temporal markers (“seventeen days,” “three days after”). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a quiet but legible closure where the narrator adopts an Earned Stasis stance (“sometimes the most quietly proactive thing you can do is simply stay”). Stakes are mostly internal and there’s no sharp turn, but the before/after in her stance toward her mother is perceptible and costs something in ongoing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a walk into the liminal place, confrontation with abandoned creations, reframing/solemnizing, and exit with a renewed stance. Causality holds under an accumulative lens—the apparitions and shell-triggered memories deepen pressure until the conceptual turn about failure vs offering lands. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after: blocked and afraid vs ready to write again, with the cost of facing her creative grief paid on the page. Stakes are modestly scaled but coherent and resolved without loose ends or contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: clear setup of the alignment, ritual execution, and a transformation that lands as closure (a successful awakening and restoration). Causality is straightforward—alignment allows the ritual, ritual awakens the moonvine—but there is no meaningful doubt or complication. The drive is essentially accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal, yet the final turn is legible and contained. The lack of any on-page price or setback keeps the arc from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear beginning (gathering), middle (preparation/remembrance), and end (sealing the pattern). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each step of the ritual follows logically and deepens the premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the completed, glowing map as the crystallization of her project and grief—though the on-page cost is more conceptual than felt. There are no orientation issues, but the lack of complication or turn beyond completion keeps this short of elite-level structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative design: arrival → study → reinterpretation → commitment to a long repair, with each step coherently emerging from the last. Orientation (who/where/when) is set efficiently in the opening lines, and the causal logic within this lyric frame holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the timer’s purpose is redefined and her “repair” becomes a reorientation of function, with seasons as the new temporal frame. The main limitation is that the pressure curve is quite gentle, so the structural turn, while present, feels more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: burdens arrive, are woven, and the calcification deepens until the closing whalebone-reverie image reweights everything as she edges closer to becoming the grotto. Causality is soft but consistent—her prior bargain dictates her current options—and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with a clear conceptual cost. What keeps it below the very top tier is the lack of a distinct mid-story turn or sharpened dilemma; the piece deepens steadily rather than tightening into a clearly legible pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: carving progresses, the lion gains features, the environment shifts light, and grief reconfigures from raw absence to held presence. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she recommits to the work as love and letting go, with a tangible before/after in how she holds him. Causality is modest but coherent—each paragraph deepens the same throughline rather than branching. The only constraint is that external stakes are low and turns are almost entirely internal, though this suits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the carousel halt and lagoon premise establish a strange stasis, the gathering of fragments thickens the field, and the ghost’s appearance plus the camera’s spin create a clear tightening toward closure. Causality is lyrical but coherent—because she carries so many abandoned futures, the negotiation is reframed from personal exceptionalism to universality of failure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: exhaustion replaces the demand for verdict, with visible cost in her relinquishing any hope of neat resolution. No orientation or lens-clarity debts emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: curiosity → descent → discovery → plan → proposal → implementation → charged final image, with no orientation issues. However, there’s no serious obstacle or reversal; the council approval and project greenlight arrive without friction, so the middle doesn’t tighten so much as progress. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration more than a Decisive Change, with limited sense of cost. Structurally sound but emotionally and dramatically somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: arrival with the dead clock → recollection and framing of the grandfather’s unfinished work → bear’s entrance → sunrise and winding as closure. Causality within this mode is coherent: he comes specifically “to make peace with an abandoned dream,” and the sanctuary’s conditions plus the bear’s presence coalesce into the decision to act. Closure (a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis) is on the page—he redefines what finishing means and alters his stance toward his grandfather’s dream. The one limitation is that the middle reflection reiterates the premise rather than tightening conflict in a distinctly new way.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clear early: who she is, where she is, and when this is happening all land smoothly. The structure is essentially a single reflective scene with accumulative beats leading to a realization about Konstantýn’s role and a directional choice on the canal, which works under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: she reinterprets Konstantýn as an architect of lies and commits to uncovering what he buried, but the price of this insight remains mostly conceptual and lightly felt. The piece reads like a potent opening to a longer work more than a fully pressurized standalone arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from dock to rope to glass to realization in a coherent causal chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he re-understands preservation and his role via the rope and fulgurite. That said, the piece is almost entirely reflective; there’s only a soft pivot from not-understanding to understanding, with limited sense of constraint or risk. The drive lens is clear enough, but the lack of sharper turns and cost keeps it out of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival after the last ship, orientation in the garden, deepening reflection, and a final stance crystallization (she will stay and become one of the absences she maps). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her role shifts from outside observer of departures to future subject of the same practice, with the missed ship as the quietly paid cost. Causality is soft but coherent—this is clearly a situational/accumulative piece, and under that lens the progression holds. The only limiter is that the narrative tension between options (stay vs. leave) is more implied than dramatized, so the turn is gently felt rather than sharply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single causal arc from arrival in the chamber → discovery of the egg → new understanding of the Genesis Engine → reoriented mission, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: he doesn’t destroy the system but leaves with a new, risk-laden purpose. However, the stakes and consequences at the end remain largely conceptual (no concrete sense of what he will face when he returns or what integration entails), so the cost is inferred more than felt. A small, specific on-page consequence or narrowed option at the end would deepen the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: a walk by the lagoon, layered reflection, and a closing realization that reconfigures her relationship to fire. Orientation is strong early—who, where, when, and her history all land without confusion. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the lagoon’s change of light reframes her father’s flames and her vocation, and she chooses to go back toward the village. The main limitation is the very soft, largely static pressure; nothing in the scene forces a new decision beyond contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The breadcrumb-to-fountain structure is clean, legible, and causally linked, with a clear progression from discovery to realization to execution at the final fountain. The move from discrete scenes into a compressed traversal (“By the fifth fountain…”) is efficient and maintains coherence under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing: Mira’s understanding of skepticism and mystery reconfigures in the final image, with the liberated memories providing a concrete culmination. The main ceiling is that the middle “quest” phase is summarized rather than dramatized, muting potential for sharper turns.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure works: the journey inward, the garden’s shedding, and the gear’s awakening build toward a quiet conceptual repricing of the heirloom’s meaning. Closure lands in the final realization that the gear is “remembering” and the acceptance that “the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be.” Stakes and cost remain mostly conceptual—no path is dramatically foreclosed, but the weight of duty and transformation of tradition are legible. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, though the lack of a sharper on-page test of this awakening keeps it below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one primary scene in the greenhouse, an accumulative build of perception, then a brief ellipsis to the workshop that lands closure. The causal/accumulative spine—go to greenhouse → read ribbon → speak poem → perceive butterflies as collective grief → reprice her vocation—holds without gaps. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: “not markers of endings but way stations for memory,” with cost in the acceptance of lifelong grief-work. The only ceiling is that the “promise to understand by the last butterfly” is more conceptual than felt as a ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ascent, a timed ritual, a backstory insertion, and a quiet, resolved descent, all under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he recommits to carrying guilt differently, not erasing it—at the pendulum’s apex and release. However, the story hints at “tonight” being distinct (“Tonight was the night of the equinox…”) without a strong causal differentiator from prior attempts, slightly softening the promised singularity of the occasion. Causality is intact, but the sense of this equinox as uniquely decisive could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the opening → descent → sovereign case → tapestry → decoding → realization → ascent. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with a clear before/after in his understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (reframing his role as listener to the dead), but the lack of complication or reversal keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a higher level. It reads as a polished vignette more than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece adopts an accumulative, lyric structure: one continuous scene that deepens from observation into a charged preparatory act. Orientation is clean (who, where, when, and what she’s about to do are all clear early), and the present-tense window holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment when she finally begins to write, reweighting all the prior meditation. The cost—accepting responsibility and uncertainty—is more conceptual than visceral but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: we move from context (story famine, illegal broadcasts) to the dust’s memory and tonight’s carefully prepared broadcast. Orientation is strong and the world logic holds, but there’s minimal progression in options—tonight feels like a slightly heightened iteration of an established pattern rather than a pivotal shift. The closure (“continued her quiet revolution”) lands as Earned Stasis / Charged Poise, yet the before/after line is thin and the cost is mostly conceptual, not actively felt. Structurally sound, but not fully exploiting the potential for a more decisive cadence or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene arc: preparation, burning, integration of ash, and a quiet but decisive reframing at the end. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—each move (mask, burning, filling) deepens the core drive rather than feeling like an “and then.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira accepts that incomplete information may be “sufficient,” with the cost of never fully knowing her grandmother. No orientation issues; the gallery, the chair, and the recent death are all anchored early and carried through.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: present-tense excavation frames extended reflection, culminating in a conceptual closure where the work is reaffirmed as resistance to official lies. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (ruined harbor, lower city, harbormaster’s office), and cause-effect within the essayistic mode is coherent. However, structural escalation is modest—more a deepening of a single stance than a meaningful tightening of options—and the “price” remains largely conceptual rather than being tested in scene. The closure (refusal of easy story and commitment to preservation) lands, but with low on-page cost and no decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one present-moment scene in the library, interwoven with backstory that’s well-anchored by physical cues (the rosette, the student’s entrance). The drive is accumulative/textural—pressure and meaning accrete rather than hinge on a big causal turn—and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration around vanishing arts and unlearning hatred. The costs (decades of silence and slow teaching) are legible, if mostly told rather than shown in live conflict. It’s coherent and satisfying, but the lack of a sharper on-page decision undercuts maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: we open with Elena at the greenhouse, interleave just enough backstory to clarify stakes, then move through approach → tasting → transformation → future intent. The causal chain (seed’s call → arrival during alignment → ingestion → decision to reclaim the space) holds, and orientation in time/space is excellent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what this ruin will be and aligns herself with the lineage, with a conceptual cost (rejecting sanctioned knowledge systems) implied on the page. The piece still reads more like a luminous vignette than a fully pressured story, so the sense of “before/after” is more thematic than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clear: blackout → mysterious beehive failure → Mira’s errand → riddle → revelation → reawakening of the system. Structure is cleanly single-POV and linear with a solid final conceptual turn about what the drones actually collect. Closure is present but soft: Elara realizes her true role and the lights return, yet the cost of this shift—personally or socially—remains lightly sketched. The discovery feels more bestowed than earned through difficult choices or tested hypotheses.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous evening, a clear investigative drive, and a conceptual closure where the house’s “aliveness” is redefined as memory and presence. Causality is soft but coherent—her noticing → intensified awareness via the shard → realization of inherited sensitivity and house-as-memory. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing with a legible before/after understanding, though the cost of this new knowledge is understated. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the pattern of quiet accumulation holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: millennia of stasis, the ampoule’s arrival, cascading revelations, and the test with the diver culminating in a new stance. Causality is coherent—each revelation drives a change in how Thalassor understands his role and how he behaves. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: he relinquishes being a “guardian” for the charged poise of being a “witness.” The cost is legible in his acceptance that his former certainties enabled harm.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—climbing, repeated experiments, then a pattern-break via the chipped die—builds cleanly to a Conceptual Repricing where the nature of the “prison” is redefined. Causality is coherent: proofs → new application of an old formula → re-interpretation of the staircase. Closure lands on-page with a clear before/after in her stance, though the cost of this shift is more implied than vividly dramatized. The single scene plus reflective weave stays legible and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: insomnia → rooftop → brush and symbols → intensified moonlight/daydreams → revelation → decision to leave paintings → sleep. The drive is accumulative/textural; pressure builds through repetition of her ritual until tonight’s pattern break (sharper visions) produces a Conceptual Repricing of what the language means. Closure lands clearly with her new understanding of kindness and a concrete behavioral shift. The stakes and cost remain modest, so while structurally sound and complete, the arc doesn’t quite reach a towering, must-publish inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from present gathering to backstory (beekeeper, repression, bread ritual) to the thaw as a new pressure, and land in a charged final stance. Causality is clear enough—thaw → danger/opportunity → Maren’s decision to risk emergence—but escalation is gentle and mostly reflective rather than dramatized. Closure functions as Charged Poise: she commits to taking their arts back into the world with visible conceptual cost, though no concrete confrontation yet materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: hunger stone as omen → descent to workroom/backstory → activation of the yoyo → dissolution/closure. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: her prior research leads logically to the final act, and the ending offers a decisive change with clear cost. The backstory of her apprentice year is efficiently tied to the present drive, not a digression. The only limitation is that the middle portion leans more on explanation of the device than on present-tense complication.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: resurrection → warning/advisor → carnival → funhouse mirrors → confession → release of curse and acceptance of life. The structure holds to one continuous scene with light backstory interleaved, and the decisive change (curse lifted, advisor gone, she drives toward a life she now claims) is clearly on the page. Cost is legible in her admission of intentional self-drowning and the felt loss of the “quiet” she’d sought. The drive lens reads predominantly causal with a strong thematic overlay, and that lens holds through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: we move through a single ritual, with the wave as a mild crest, toward a closing image of harmony between prophet and sea. Causality is simple but legible (strikes produce sound; sound maps the ocean; a larger wave produces a bigger musical event). Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—obstacles affirmed as music—but the before/after line is faint and costless. The scene feels complete but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single anchored scene, with backstory and world history interleaved and clearly cued. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—patterns → question about the watchers → whistle signal → turtles respond and the spiral glows. Closure lands as a charged poise: the world’s rules visibly respond to Mira’s transgression, reconfiguring what’s possible without fully paying off consequences. The cost is mostly conceptual and future-facing rather than dramatized, which holds it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: a single, reflective scene in the station culminating in her commitment to publish the letter. The causal spine (letter unsealed → confrontation with myth → decision to expose) is sound, though much of it is delivered as exposition rather than dramatized beats. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise moment when she resolves to publish despite social cost. Escalation is modest; the piece reads more as a thematic framing of a decision than a scene where options visibly narrow under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with clear orientation, a concrete inciting action (finding the inkwell), and an ending that reconfigures her life’s frame of meaning. Causality is straightforward—her long-term work leads her to the pavilion, the inkwell’s inscription prompts a conceptual shift, and she claims a new identity as she leaves. As an accumulative/textural piece, the pressure rises via the tide and mounting reflection rather than large reversals, which works but keeps tension modest. Closure is solidly a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the felt cost of this reorientation remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: blackout → altered perception → pattern in marginalia → discovery of the sanctuary → decision to join its work, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: Mira’s understanding of the archive (and her job) is permanently reweighted, and she quietly forecloses a safer, purely bureaucratic path. However, the cost of this shift remains mostly implied (no concrete danger or sacrifice is dramatized), keeping the change somewhat bloodless. Within a lyric, textural mode, though, the progression is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from current work → past rupture (shadow detachment, failed ascension) → present method → a single, charged use of the lantern, closing on her continued practice. Causality within this mode holds—her past attempts and realizations directly shape her current refusal of ascension and commitment to lantern-making. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: “this was what it meant to live…” crystallizes the narrative into a before/after vocabulary of grief-as-craft. The only thing holding it short of the very top band is that the on-page arc is more confirmation of an existing stance than a new decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly anchored in the observatory present with one extended reflective braid back to the wedding, taught early and held consistently. As an accumulative/textural design, it deepens rather than “advances” plot in a conventional causal sense, and the closure—a reweighting of his survival into a perpetual search—is legible with cost. The wedding/drone/geode linkages are conceptually rigorous, but there is no clear mid-scene turn or new constraint; pressure grows by repetition and refinement more than a decisive escalation. That keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → journey → observatory → recognizing the stellar language → activating the device → conceptual shift about belonging, and the single-scene structure is coherent. The closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: what she thought was an external code becomes an always-present fabric, with a clear before/after in her understanding. However, the mission stakes around the relay station and survey corp are set up then largely abandoned once the machine awakens, so external goals don’t pay off meaningfully. The mechanisms also cooperate a bit too easily, so there’s little sense that options could have failed or closed.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: terrace → shore → carvings → watch hand → reconfiguration of her father’s death and her own complicity. Causality holds—her profession leads to victims, which leads to driftwood messages, which leads to the specific relic that triggers the decisive recall. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from suppression to an explicit stance that some memories “could only be survived,” with emotional cost legible on the page. The piece remains structurally modest, with one main turn rather than layered tightening, which keeps it short of elite complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter punctuated by a reflective midsection that directly informs the final act. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens—his history of failed exchanges leads to the moon-phase method, then to the decision that this ritual must end, culminating in dropping the heirlooms. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with felt cost: they relinquish symbolic anchors of three generations, reconfiguring future meetings. The only reason this doesn’t reach a higher band is that the decisive choice has been largely made “over many sleepless nights,” leaving limited on-page narrowing of options in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored early in place and time, with reflection interleaved and clearly cued by sensory triggers. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: past collapse of expectations → years of withdrawal → present-day launch as test → moment of joy and reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she no longer self-identifies as broken) with emotional cost tied to the years lost and risk of trying. Escalation is modest but coherent; nothing crucial is left dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: procedure → descent via clues → revelation at the lake, with a clear because/therefore chain (clippings → entrance → bioluminescent reveal → meeting the traveler). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what the “reset” means is redefined, with a felt cost in realizing she must rebuild without the crutch of remembered guilt. The drive is largely accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal; tension rarely sharpens into a decisive pivot, so the journey feels contemplative more than pressured. Still, orientation is solid and the single-scene progression is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrive in orchard → prepare ritual → undergo/accept transformation with a reweighted understanding of death and love. The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent, and closure arrives via her decision to become the bridge and the statement that her transformation will be complete by dawn. Cost is implied (loss of full humanity) but not concretely dramatized in terms of what she will forfeit in her life going forward. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and the structural cadence is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single present-tense ritual in the glade woven with sharply anchored backstory, all clearly motivated by the desire to reclaim lost time. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens: cards → glade → saucer focus → vision currents → self-wounding → conceptual shift from “accumulation” to “release.” Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing with cost—she relinquishes the fantasy of gaining back time in favor of accepting irreversible loss. There are no orientation issues or broken setups; the only limitation is that external stakes remain minimal, keeping the piece primarily interior.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: observation → noticing the shimmer → decision to stitch → the photographs lighting → the dimension opening. Causality is clear under a textural/lyric lens, with the stitching work and released grief leading to the dimensional shift. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change when the door opens and she steps through, carrying the images and integrated shadow. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (what exactly is at risk or gained by opening the dimension is never concretized), which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: pilgrimage → detour → beach → jars → eclipse → legible message, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing that reframes Mara as transformation itself. Causality is soft but intact (landslide → forbidden shore; past philanthropy → present jars), and orientation is strong from the opening. Closure lands via the eclipse apex and the fireflies’ message, with a before/after in her understanding and a conceptual cost in relinquishing beauty she gathers. The piece does lean heavily on summary prophecy/backstory rather than on-page turning points, but the lyric mode supports the design.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → curiosity about anomalies → decoding the sundial → unlocking the quill holder → discovering the cradle of sparks → decision to act. Structure is single-scene and coherent, with a clear before/after in her understanding and intent, and the closure beat (“By dawn, she would have transmitted…”) lands as a decisive narrative turn. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, but the implied danger of treason under an authoritarian regime is legible. The only soft spot is a slightly expository info-dump about the network that could be more dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: backstory and world rules are efficiently embedded in a single continuous scene that builds toward the Spiral of Catching Hold. Causality is coherent—years of experimentation lead to this final all-in attempt with the last of the dust, which then precipitates the eel response and conceptual shift. Closure is solidly a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: what “eel herding” and “borrowed dawn” mean is reweighted with some cost (spending the last dust, relinquishing the catching paradigm). The main limitation is that the price and danger of failure feel slightly soft, so the structural stakes of the final act never fully tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: observatory vigil → storm arrival → opening the envelope → reading and reinterpreting her silence → beginning to write again. Causality is subtle but legible (her climb and the envelope reading lead to the final reconfiguration), and the closure—her shift from waiting for permission to actively writing—is on-page and coherent. The global drive reads as Accumulative/Textural, with the storm’s intensification and the timer’s counting deepening rather than flipping the situation. Stakes remain internal and quiet, which slightly softens the sense of irreversible cost despite clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline—waiting → confrontation → escalating duel → philosophical reframe → détente—is clear and cleanly executed in a single continuous scene. Closure lands via a conceptual and relational shift: the younger scholar’s certainty cracks and the conflict reframes from victory to illumination. The cost is somewhat soft, mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a concrete loss or altered option set. Still, the structure is solidly publishable-level for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous accumulative scene of work → talk → mutual revelation → collaborative creation → charged closure. Causality is soft but coherent—each deepening of their conversation naturally follows the previous one, and the final image (cathedral of pages, next reader) is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with modest but legible cost (vulnerability, commitment to this small resistance). There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored early. The main limitation is that the closure, while elegant, doesn’t significantly reconfigure options beyond emotional shading.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: station performance → signal (compasses) → ascent and portal → arbor and performance, with backstory interleaved in a controlled way. Causality is intact and the rules of the portal (compasses + specific film flickers + timing) are understandable and consistent. Closure lands as a resonant stasis/charged poise: he reaches the arbor and plays the long-delayed piece in defiance of “fate,” reconfiguring the meaning of his routine. The main limitation is that the narrative unfolds almost exactly as expected from the initial setup with no meaningful structural surprise or turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: morning setup, journey to the ridge, ritual, and conceptual shift form a coherent causal throughline. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reframes her work from guarding a boundary to trusting in dispersed, unverifiable continuity, with the monsoon as a temporal boundary to that realization. The monsoon deadline and the “last chance” generational pressure are more atmospheric than actively tested, so stakes escalate gently rather than sharply. Nonetheless, the global drive (largely accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings) holds smoothly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative lyric: present action with the compass and lace accrues meaning through interleaved backstory about Elias and the severance. Causality is soft but coherent—the compass and pattern lead to realization, which then reframes his relationship to regret and forgiveness. Closure lands clearly with the compass pointing inward and Marek resuming bonsai work in a new emotional stance (a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with cost acknowledged). The main weakness is that the trail in the lace is more asserted than dramatized in stepwise decoding, which slightly blunts the sense of process.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is sound, utilizing a time jump to deepen the initial beat, and the Accumulative lens holds. However, the connection between the spreading dust and the neutron star models feels intellectually asserted rather than causally earned on the page. The closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing, though the cost remains largely philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure with a decisive change in stance (victim to hunter). However, the pivotal mechanic—a frost pattern matching a specific ledger notation of a "name"—relies on poetic logic that strains plausibility. How a physical path's frost shape correlates to a written name is unclear, weakening the causal link of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a realization (Conceptual Repricing), but the closure lacks a visible or felt cost. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks the music, fears the chaos briefly, but finds immediate, comforting hope. Without a sacrifice or a foreclosed option to balance the gain, the ending feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to handle the climax, compressing the central conflict—the healing of the souls—into a montage ("slowly, painstakingly") rather than dramatizing a specific, high-pressure beat. This elides the causal struggle, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and backstory ("Her method was the midnight food runs") rather than unfolding present-action scenes. While orientation and causality are clear, the climax (ringing the bell) leads to a tableau of unity without a decisive turn or twist. The drive lens is accumulative, but the pacing feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.7)
    The plot is a linear procedural (arrive, detect, heal) that lacks a decisive turning point or causal complication. The resolution acts as a "soft reset" where the problem dissolves through competence alone, failing to generate the tension or structural consequence needed for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a coherent Hybrid arc from discovery to a Decisive Change closure. The logic of the resolution—drawing in dirt to stabilize time—relies on poetic association rather than strict causal mechanism, which caps the score below the 9-band despite excellent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of unlocking a door; while the sequence is clear, it lacks a decisive turn or reversal, and the "disguise" logic is shaky in an abandoned setting. The closure (entering the vault to wait) is a "Charged Poise," but because the central puzzle was solved in backstory, the on-page momentum feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building atmosphere effectively toward the resolution. The causality is somewhat soft; the breakthrough feels more like a gifted epiphany than the result of immediate pressure, and the closure—a slight smile and return to work—lacks a sharp, felt cost to seal the change.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear structure with a legible resonant reconfiguration at the end. However, the closure is soft, relying on a resource cost (empty jar) rather than a difficult personal trade-off, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative functions as a vignette under an Accumulative lens, but the closure—finishing the vessel—lacks a "decisive change" or legible cost. The scene is linear and coherent, but the stakes remain static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot relies on a significant contrivance: the critical childhood cast is conveniently "abandoned on a reading table" in the random library Maya fled to (or was led to). Daniel's presence is explained, but his decision to leave the incriminating evidence within her reach while monologuing undermines the causal chain. The closure is a declarative stance shift rather than a result of active maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, following a simple task-completion arc without meaningful reversals or unexpected obstacles. The closure relies on a summary of success ("She had succeeded") rather than a dramatized moment where the map's creation exacts a visible cost or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc suitable for a vignette. However, the inciting incident—a violin that simply "materialized" in a closet—relies on convenience, and the timeline loops are summarized as backstory rather than dramatized in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and coherent, but the stakes are low because success is achieved without setbacks. The closure (a sense of hope/new beginning) is a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the lack of a tangible obstacle or felt cost in the exchange makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on reflective summary of a past conflict (the investors) which resolves the story's most interesting tension off-stage. The present-time action (polishing marbles) is largely static until the final paragraph; while the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, the lack of present-tense causality makes the structure feel like a vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear success path without a "Decisive Change" involving trade-offs or cost. While orientation and causality are clear, the closure is a frictionless victory lap that validates the hypothesis without generating dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    The logic of survival (three days in a flood without evacuation) breaks the reality of the scene immediately. The subplot about "evidence the management had buried" is introduced at the climax but abandoned instantly for emotional closure, leaving a significant causal thread unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal arc is clean, moving from incapacity to renewed function through a specific physical trigger (the smudge). The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the past error. The connection between the internal realization and the external action of typing the forecast is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible under a Situational lens, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist joins the chorus. However, the radio's supernatural function acts as a convenient bridge to closure rather than a pressure earned through causal sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece is a vignette describing a routine state of being (a loop) rather than a story with a causal arc. It fails the closure requirement as there is no decisive change, reconfiguration, or legible cost within the scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the orientation is solid, establishing the setting and situation quickly. However, the closure—while thematically consistent—lacks a felt cost or a "decisive change" generated by friction; the eclipse does the heavy lifting, resulting in a low-tension resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Hybrid arc, building density toward a Conceptual Repricing where stories are recontextualized as fuel. Closure lands effectively with a sense of purpose, though the convergence of the tapestry and diary relies on convenient timing. Orientation is handled well, grounding the abstract concepts in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively to the situational crisis of the letter, leading to a clean moment of Earned Stasis. The arrival of the prophesied characters at the end borders on convenience, but the established logic of "currents" earns this synchronicity as a thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative functions as a vivid prologue or vignette, building effectively to a "Charged Poise" at the threshold but stopping before the central conflict engages. While the internal realization about the color provides a beat of closure, the narrative arc feels truncated, serving as a setup for a scene rather than a self-contained story with a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent lyric arc, moving from the pressure of dawn to the release of the final message. The causality is soft; the dissolution of the spire feels like a scheduled event rather than a consequence of a specific, hard-won action. Closure is achieved through a resonant image (Conceptual Repricing), though the cost is somewhat ethereal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of movement and observation without a distinct causal turn or rising pressure; the resolution (deciding to go "through") feels inevitable rather than earned. The "cost" of the journey is described ("shadowed corridors") but does not force a trade-off or alter the protagonist's tactics in a tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative suffers a significant orientation break when "hours passed" is conflated with "seasons turned," destabilizing the scene's timeframe. The closure dissolves into a generalized summary of her future ("would become her sanctuary") rather than landing a specific, charged moment of change in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is solid, linking the arrival of the message to her specific expertise in weather anomalies to solve the puzzle. However, the timing of the pigeon's arrival coinciding exactly with her realization of being followed is a convenient compression that eases pressure rather than creating it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with low complication, relying on an "explain-everything" climax where the brother's research intentions are summarized rather than dramatized. The closure lands on a realization that feels intellectually delivered rather than emotionally earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from an established stasis to a moment of "Charged Poise" at the closure. The ending is legible and conceptually earned, satisfying the requirements of a situational drive lens where the protagonist reconfigures her stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building density through music to break the established pattern of silence. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the "hush" is not destroyed but interrupted, creating an "unsteady rhythm." The pacing is controlled, though the resolution relies on a somewhat standard magical-realism shift rather than a hard causal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory of preparation, execution, and validation without a significant causal turn or obstacle. While the closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing, it reads as a safe reaffirmation of her starting stance rather than a hard-won insight paid for with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on the coincidence of finding a specific letter in a library book, which weakens the causal chain. While the closure provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of obstacles between the discovery and the delivery makes the structure feel convenient and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to investigation to realization. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causality of the climax relies on a convenient magical prop (the mirror-tree) to deliver the answer, rather than the protagonist forcing a result through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem-travel-fix" structure with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The resolution relies on convenient prior knowledge and a specific magical tool available from the start, resulting in a "soft reset" ending with no visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a tangible cost—the sacrifice of the expensive glass eyes. The inciting incident is internal, which fits the meditative mode, though the causality is driven more by reflection than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on weak causality, using a sudden "sense memory" and an unexplained supernatural link to resolve the plot. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where everyone succeeds without visible or felt cost, failing to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving clearly from the inciting letter to the resonant reconfiguration at the trellis. The closure is effective and legible, with the phone call serving as a decisive action that cements the internal shift. The pacing allows the accumulative weight of the leaf and the diagnosis to land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, functional causal line: deprivation leads to a journey, which leads to a transaction and resolution. The closure is distinct (she sleeps), achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of assets (brooch for telescope). The orientation is solid, though the pacing is quite fast, moving from travel to climax in a short span.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is solid, utilizing a distinct "Inciting Incident" (pearls show nothing) to force a change in stance. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to his gift is fundamentally altered. The "nine days" time jump compresses the resolution, but the trajectory remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Orientation and structure are solid, but the closure relies on internal monologue explaining the symbol's meaning rather than a dramatized action with visible cost. The epiphany resolves the narrative question too neatly via summary.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot follows a linear, convenient path where magical assistance (shifting arrows) removes navigational agency and risk. The closure functions as a "soft reset," resolving deep grief with a single action of the ticket punch without exacting a visible or felt cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where the protagonist faces a genuine obstacle or risk. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing of the migration, the resolution feels "additive" (keeping both skepticism and wonder) rather than forcing a transformation with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, situational path (waiting for the storm) that resolves via external events rather than agency. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of an on-page cost or obstacle makes the resolution feel convenient and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a summary leap ("Three weeks later") to resolve the central conflict, skipping the actual confrontation with the "rigged" asylum system. This structural choice deflates the tension established by Darius's desperate arrival. The resolution feels unearned because the mechanism of victory—the application itself—is treated as a guaranteed success without an on-page test of its efficacy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative sets up a disruption ("Today, the hum had changed") but fails to escalate it into a meaningful turn or consequence; the story loops back to the established routine without altering the status quo. Closure is weak, relying on a poetic reaffirmation of her method rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that costs the character something. The plot remains a vignette with a false start.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "convenient resolution" anti-pattern where a secondary character appears exactly when needed to explain the central prop's significance via exposition. This coincidence resolves the mystery rather than complicating it, bypassing the need for the protagonist to earn the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    The introduction of the "ephemeral compass" as a sudden realization lacks narrative setup, creating a logic gap where the protagonist identifies a concept she hasn't encountered. Closure is legible as a conceptual repricing, but the lack of friction makes the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    The closure relies on predictive summary ("By morning, the graffiti network would spread") rather than a dramatized shift with visible immediate consequences. The ending assumes the success of the protagonist's action rather than earning it through scene friction or demonstrating a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative is a linear countdown with a legible Accumulative drive, but the closure feels inevitable rather than earned by a hard choice. The ending lands on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (accepting loss), but the lack of causal turns or unexpected obstacles makes the structure feel safe and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The climax is summarized ("A patch here, a careful reconnection there") rather than dramatized, bypassing the pivotal moment of change. Closure is achieved through simple task completion without the required felt or conceptual cost, leaving the ending tidy but weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line from the falcon's arrival to the decoding of the message. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing of the landscape, though the falcon's precise success feels slightly convenient without on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure fits the concept of resonance perfectly, using repetition to build density and weight. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the stones finally respond—is earned and distinct. The causal link between the footfalls and the revival is established early and paid off clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the causal chain holds under a situational lens, moving logically from the air crisis to the transformative resolution. The closure is distinct and resonant (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration), though the resolution relies heavily on the convenient mechanics of the magic system to solve the physical threat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, moving from the exterior railing to the inner sanctum of the cell. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus accepts his role as the new truth-teller—lands effectively with the arrival of the keeper and the village's impending discovery. The causality of the "door left ajar" is surreal but fits the established mythic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story achieves a clean Resonant Reconfiguration; the debt transfer is a Decisive Change that releases the protagonist while binding the successor. Causality is solid under an accumulative lens that shifts to causal at the climax, with the "loving venom" acting as the mechanism of change.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path (walk, sew, arrive, finish) without a meaningful tightening of stakes or a causal turn. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by an unopposed ability, lacking the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story violates the short-story scope default by summarizing a week of excavation ("found... on the fourth day," "worked through the week") rather than dramatizing a specific scene. This montage structure prevents causal tension from accumulating in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative functions well as an atmospheric vignette, and the closure (the postscript) lands a clear conceptual repricing. However, the subplot regarding chalk codes feels disconnected from the central action of Eleanor's letter, creating a loose thread that dilutes the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette that describes a habitual state rather than a causal sequence with a turning point. The ending acts as a thematic reiteration of the opening—she stitches secrets—without a decisive change, realization, or paid cost to mark the transition. The story relies on the promise of future action (the coup) rather than present scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear instruction-completion structure: the window tells her what to do, and she does it. This reduces protagonist agency, as the setting provides both the direction and the absolution without forcing a difficult, costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving effectively from the doctor's request to the decoding and finally to a resonant closure. The ending—Elira deciding to return the cast—qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt sense of witness, though the "anesthetic" frame slightly dampens the urgency of the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building effectively to the projection. However, the closure relies on a magical event that resolves the internal conflict without a decisive, agency-driven trade-off from the protagonist; the darkening of the fresco is a cost that happens *to* her, not one she chooses to pay.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building density through sensory details to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure. The ending lands cleanly, recontextualizing the restoration work as a conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is solid, with a clear causal line from arrival to planting. However, the climax (drone encounter) resolves too easily through a line of dialogue, lacking the friction or cost required for a higher band. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there feels protected.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is iterative ("each day," "sometimes") and lacks a specific temporal anchor, failing the orientation test for a distinct scene. The plot is static: a description of a condition rather than a causal sequence of beats. Closure is a continuation ("she writes faster") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a vignette with a loop structure (work, reflection, return) rather than a causal plot. While legible, it lacks a decisive change or a "Resonant Reconfiguration" with visible cost; the ending affirms the status quo without dramatizing the price of that stasis beyond stated emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution arrives with "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem is solved perfectly with no visible cost or trade-off. The climax relies on a convenient realization ("humanity had not been ready") that unlocks the puzzle instantly, and Elian’s timely entrance dissolves the central tension without an on-page test of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot hinges on a severe causality break: finding standard workshop chemicals in adhesive does not logically lead to the specific conclusion that the father left to "redirect potential catastrophe." This knowledge leap unearths the resolution without earning it through on-page evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative lens, layering memory and process effectively. While the closure provides a Resonant Reconfiguration of her grief, the central mechanic—mapping dust motes to reconstruct audio—strains causality even for speculative fiction, lacking the "taught" logic required to make the breakthrough feel fully earned rather than magical.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on coincidence and convenience; the terrace drifts to the exact destination required without the protagonist influencing the trajectory. The logic connecting furniture grain analysis to navigational coordinates is tenuous, breaking causal suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    A critical continuity error breaks causality: Marek places the feather in the cabinet (Para 4), but in the next paragraph, he settles on the floor with the "feather in his hand" without retrieving it. The narrative arc is linear and low-pressure; the flooding provides a backdrop but forces no tactical trade-offs or sacrifices, resulting in a soft, inevitable closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is solid and the closure successfully reconfigures the father's loss into acceptance. However, the central pivot—overcoming the "gap" in the vision—relies on a soft causal leap ("grief has its own logic") rather than a tactical problem-solving beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates as a vignette or portrait rather than a causal narrative; there is no inciting incident that disrupts Marek's status quo, only a routine performance. Closure is weak because the "success" of the trick restores stasis without any visible or felt cost, emotional price, or reconfiguration of his world. The narrative arc is a flat line of competence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of successful task execution without causal tightening or obstacles. The "nostalgia ban" provides background context but exerts no active pressure in the scene, making the closure—a shift in internal perspective—feel inevitable rather than earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a vignette/portrait rather than a story, lacking a causal chain or accumulative pressure that leads to a necessary resolution. The ending is a return to routine without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette of reflection with minimal present-tense causal movement. The climax involves speaking to the air, which feels like a low-stakes ritual rather than a pressure-driven turning point; the reflection ratio is high, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a generalized vignette describing a routine rather than a causal sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and end. There is no inciting incident to disrupt the status quo, and the ending ("found her purpose") merely restates the premise without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The "parallel timelines" concept is asserted as a theory but does not causally impact the narrative flow or create a legible plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the accumulative structure serves the concept, but the plot pivots on the convenient discovery of the exact necessary diary. Closure lands as a conceptual realization, though the "modern" (现代) text artifact disrupts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a procedural vignette that lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost; the ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the goal is achieved exactly as planned. While the sequence is legible, the absence of friction or consequence creates a "smooth run" anti-pattern that fails the closure requirement of a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene has a clear arc and legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the causal mechanism—a speech and a list—resolves the tension with minimal friction. The handshake feels like a "soft" resolution given the established weight of "forever war," lacking a moment where the deal nearly breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path—arrival, wait, release—without a decisive turn or unexpected obstacle to challenge the protagonist's agency. While the closure (the release) is legible, it arrives as the completion of a checklist rather than a response to escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative functions as a low-stakes vignette where the central action (untangling) proceeds without resistance, error, or unexpected complication. Closure is an internal affirmation (Earned Stasis) that lacks a visible or felt cost on the page, leaving the ending conceptually flat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is functional, moving from setup to ritual to epiphany, but the causal link between "telling a story backward" and the realization "some stories should be unfinished" is tenuous and symbolic rather than logical. The climax relies on a coincidence (the meteor) to punctuate the internal realization, weakening the sense of earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a legible drive lens (Situational) and valid closure (Conceptual Repricing) where Elara accepts transience. The inciting incident and climax are well-positioned, though the transition from disaster to solution feels somewhat frictionless; the "improvisation" succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt or failure that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, with clear orientation and a legible accumulation lens leading to a resonant reconfiguration closure. The causal link between the mechanical punch card and the fiber rope is poetic rather than strictly logical, but it holds within the story's mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story builds a coherent setup but fails to dramatize the climax, opting instead for a summary statement ("Then she transcended") that bypasses the actual scene of change. While the realization about the directive ("answers" not "instructions") offers a moment of conceptual repricing, the lack of on-page cost or consequence hollows out the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pivotal discovery of the key information occurs in summary ("discovered hidden within palace archives"), robbing the narrative of active problem-solving pressure. The closure relies on a "magic fix" where the covenant pacifies the regime without Maruk paying a visible, felt price for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The resolution relies on soft magic where emotional catharsis instantly repairs a physical object; while thematic, the causality is tenuous and lacks a felt cost, leaning heavily on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is a flat line of competence: accept task, perform task, succeed. The closure is purely additive—a success state—without the requisite "felt cost" or tradeoff that gives a story weight; causality is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands with a clear reconfiguration of stance, but the climax relies on the coincidental arrival of the young woman to validate the protagonist's insight. The narrative relies on summary to bypass the actual struggle of the repair work, flattening the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal chain, but the closure relies on a low-cost realization that feels inevitable rather than earned. The circular time loop is mechanically sound but lacks a felt price or "Resonant Reconfiguration"; the protagonist simply asks a question and receives the answer, resolving the tension with a gift rather than a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story follows a clear causal path from investigation to diagnosis to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the mission's nature is redefined. The logic of researching "gaps" is satisfying, though the resolution relies on internal synthesis rather than an on-page test of this new "vocabulary of loss."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear transition from observation to action (stepping into the fog). The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the inciting shift (fog thinning) feels more environmental than strictly causal. Orientation on the ship is established quickly and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: discovery, application of tool, and immediate success without reversal or complication. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the door opens exactly as predicted, lacking the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a straight linear path (problem, search, discovery, solution) without a significant complication or on-page cost. While the "bloom of hush" provides a Resonant Reconfiguration, the victory feels virtually frictionless, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery-decision arc that relies heavily on the protagonist's special ability to bypass investigative obstacles. While the ending lands a legible "Charged Poise" (the decision to climb), the lack of prior complications or reversals makes the resolution feel virtually costless. The drive lens is Causal but weak, as the "blessing" acts as an instant solution to the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is solid under an Accumulative lens, with the storm's intensity paralleling the internal insight. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of identity—lands clearly and logically follows the setup. Orientation is immediate and effectively grounded, though the narrative arc is somewhat linear and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and provides a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the fire answers the darkness. However, the inciting clue—the mosaic note—relies on a convenient "video game prompt" logic that simplifies the discovery process. The causality is linear, but the ease with which the solution presents itself (reading the tiles) reduces the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative structure is static, occupying a "pause" where momentum stalls in favor of internal exposition. The closure relies on a cliché metaphor ("tide was turning") and a soft gesture, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vignette structure works for the scope, utilizing the hour-long gravity shift as a ticking clock. However, the closure relies on a "pulsing" doll and a stated epiphany that feels slightly disconnected from the causal action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Situational arc with legible closure: the nightmare is resolved, and the glass clears. However, the "cost" (extending the route, using the vapor) feels negligible, resulting in a resolution that leans toward "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with solid orientation, but the climax relies on following instructions found in a mural rather than a high-agency decision. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through navigating dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally complete with a clear decisive change at the closure (opening the door). However, the causality is dream-like and linear; the confrontation with the "former self" serves as a convenient symbolic pivot rather than a pressure-tested plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a "soft reset" ending where a magical event resolves internal conflict without a distinct cost. The connection between the bolt, the mushrooms, and the texts relies on dream logic that weakens causality. Closure feels like symmetric satisfaction rather than a hard-won reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story terminates mid-sentence ("that had echoe"), resulting in a total absence of closure and failing the prompt's requirement for a complete narrative. This fatal structural flaw renders the drive lens invalid and leaves the central causal chain unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Closure fails the "felt cost" requirement; the protagonist receives a gift (healing/insight) without paying a price or making a sacrifice, resulting in symmetric satisfaction. The narrative relies on a "magic solves it" structure where the environment acts upon a passive character.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece functions as a static vignette rather than a story, lacking the required causal tightening, escalation of options, or decisive change expected for this scope; the closure is reflective rather than reconfigurative.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and orientation is solid, but the causal logic strains credibility with the "puddle map." Relying on a grandmother's teaching to interpret a specific ephemeral reflection of a broken streetlamp as a map feels like a convenient contrivance rather than organic plotting. The tension dips significantly in the final third as the opposition remains distant.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is a coherent ritual beat culminating in Earned Stasis, with the saxophonist successfully maintaining the status quo. Causality is linear and legible, though the climax—resolving the breach with "three sharp notes"—feels mechanically simple and lacks a surprising tactical shift to elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: a leaf falls, she reads it, and immediately finds the solution in the vault without obstacle or cost. The connection between the "tiny monuments" and the forgotten seed is thematic but convenient, resolving the conflict through backstory preparation rather than present-moment struggle. The ending provides a Decisive Change but lacks the requisite "felt cost" for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=1.0)
    The piece is a fragment (~285 words) rather than a complete story, failing the 600–800 word scope and the fundamental requirement for on-page closure. It ends at the threshold of the inciting incident without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with clear causality: the failure of the search drives the need for a new approach, leading to the repair and subsequent revelation. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of her relationship to her brother's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive procedural arc with excellent orientation throughout. The causality of the magic system (tooth → distortion → release) is established and executed cleanly. The closure is legible—an "Earned Stasis" for Mira and release for the soldier—though the lack of a significant complication makes the progression feel slightly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative drive lens holds well, moving from disorientation to a decisive stance (keeping the mask). The closure lands as a clear Charged Poise, where the choice to walk toward the unknown clearing creates a resonant, high-cost ending state.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure unit is legible, but the central turn relies entirely on the Alchemist delivering an expository monologue to resolve the mystery. This creates a passive middle section where information is received rather than earned through struggle or active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from an inciting incident (lights failing) to a discovery (the hatch). The closure functions as a threshold crossing—a Decisive Action where he accepts the mission—but it feels more like the start of a story than a resolved shard. The causality is linear and logical, though the progression is somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is clean and linear, effectively moving from the inciting frost-read to the climatic release. The closure lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the world state, though the lack of significant obstacles makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The single-scene structure effectively uses the storm as a pressure cooker to force the climax. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview, though the explicit thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph ("truth mattered less...") slightly over-explains the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative logic that is coherent but lacks a causal pivot or decisive turning point. The setup explicitly promises that Cassian's "honesty would be tested," but this test never materializes in the scene, resulting in a procedural resolution where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and decisive, moving from the inciting compass to the final descent without wasted motion. The physical causality of the factory closing to reveal the path is a strong anchor for the mystical elements, and the ending functions as a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative operates as a linear vignette where the epiphany is delivered by a magical object rather than earned through causal pressure. The closure relies on a "gain-only" realization (Conceptual Repricing) without the requisite felt or conceptual cost to give the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution relies on a highly convenient coincidence—a salvaged chapel window containing a secret celestial map that answers the specific botanical question. This "deus ex fenestra" resolves the plot without protagonist agency, and the logic of chapel artisans encoding blooming times strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path—decipher, travel, observe—devoid of causal complications or necessary reversals. The climax relies on an "explain-everything" monologue from an apparition that dissolves tension through exposition rather than resolving it through dramatic action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line to a valid Decisive Change (restoration of the town), though the cost is largely conceptual (the burden of teaching) rather than a price paid visibly in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is elegant, utilizing a cohesive accumulative lens that builds pressure through atmosphere and memory. The shift from the physical silence of the foghorn to the metaphysical "voice" of the dead creates a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure feels earned, transforming the inciting absence into a permanent, meaningful presence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and predictable, lacking a causal chain of complications or resistance that would generate drive. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of abstract concepts, but because the ritual proceeds without obstacle, the resolution feels inevitable and unearned rather than a result of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear situational arc—waiting for the storm and executing the test—that is coherent but low on structural surprise or causality gaps. Closure is achieved through the successful test and the breaking of the "solstice hush," which functions as a valid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The plot is efficient but functions more as a vignette of competence than a dramatic narrative with heavy torque.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with no meaningful tightening or complication; the janitor arrives, performs a task, and leaves without obstacle. While the Accumulative lens is attempted, the ending acts as a continuation of established routine rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The absence of a decisive change or reweighting of stakes leaves the structure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that moves smoothly from setup to resolution, but it lacks causal density or significant turns. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting the burden), but the lack of obstacles makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative lens but suffers from static sequencing; the "inciting incident" (finding the shard) is backstory. The closure relies on a purely internal realization ("Time was...") that feels more like a summarized epiphany than a hard-won conceptual repricing with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative functions as a coherent lyric vignette, but the causal link between the poet's action (binding the kite) and the bird's recovery is weak; the bird recovers independently while the poet watches. The logic of the central object is muddy—identified as a drake's feather, then immediately realized as a kingfisher's plume—which creates a wobble in the narrative reality.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative lens, layering detail to build a portrait of duty and legacy. While the ending achieves a form of Earned Stasis, the lack of a decisive on-page turn or immediate obstacle limits the narrative drive; the closure feels like a restatement of a prior realization rather than a reconfiguration of stakes with fresh cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is solid and cyclical, effectively using the climb and descent to frame the epiphany. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist recontextualizes her skepticism; however, the "artificial pilgrimage" parallels are explained explicitly rather than allowed to resonate organically.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative forms a legible linear shard with a clear objective, but the closure—instant sprouting upon planting—feels unearned by the low-stakes process. The resolution relies on magical convenience rather than a decisive change or paid cost, weakening the causal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.2)
    Closure relies on a spontaneous realization ("Tonight... I finally understood") rather than a causal chain of choices, resulting in a "soft reset" where the problem dissolves simply because the narrator stops trying. There is no visible cost or price paid for this breakthrough in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc depends on a passive climax ("The glimpse came without warning") that resolves the conflict without agency. The transition from confusion to clarity lacks a causal mechanism or paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.4)
    The mid-story reset ("I have miscounted") is not taught early, causing it to read as a momentum-killing error rather than a structural device. The ending bypasses the conflict raised in the second iteration (the "stolen decades ago" twist) by having the protagonist walk away without resolving the causal chain or paying a dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is an atmospheric vignette rather than a story with causal drive; the lens is Accumulative/Textural. The movement is internal and thematic—shifting from mourning (sister's name) to hope ("beginning")—but this shift happens without external pressure or obstacle. Closure lands as a resonant assertion of theme ("history was being written") rather than a consequence of a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is clear with a legible closure (leaving the mountain). The reliance on a summary time-jump ("seven nights") to resolve the central obstacle weakens the causal density of the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a massive coincidence: an exiled tutor finding a tapestry in a random frozen village that depicts her specific court trial and hidden truth. While the "thunder clock" adds effective pressure, this convenient prop undermines the causal chain, turning the resolution into a stroke of luck rather than an earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure, but the tension flatlines rather than escalates. The climax (the priests' arrival) is undercut by the immediate assertion that the battle is already won ("truth had already been refracted"), dissolving the narrative pressure without a confrontation or a felt price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation and pacing are strong, but the closure suffers from a significant causality break (a "soft reset"). The physical threat of the acid sea retreats solely because of the protagonist's internal emotional shift ("surprised by her lack of fear"), which unearnedly resolves the life-or-death stakes established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot hinges on a significant coincidence—dropping the shell exactly where a "wrong turn" leads to a hidden, magical chamber. While the closure (leaving the shell) is structurally sound (Conceptual Repricing), the "magic pool" functions as a convenient device to resolve the psychological conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure with legible closure, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical tool that works on the first attempt without complication. The causality is functional but lacks tension, as the "thermal currents" affecting the light are resolved by a pseudo-magical fix that faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with minimal resistance; the inciting call leads directly to a successful resolution without obstacles or tactical pivots. Closure relies on a summary promise of future action ("Together, they would build something") rather than a dramatized decisive change or incurred cost in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory (climb to arrival) with no significant causal turns or reversals to generate narrative drive. The closure represents a "soft" stasis—she sits to study—which lacks a distinct, paid cost or a decisive change in the story's state.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on a low-probability "hidden note" trope to resolve the central mystery, undercutting the causal chain. While the sequence is legible, the pivot from observing missing footprints to re-examining the flower feels tenuous, and the resolution arrives via discovery rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident and climax are well-defined. However, the use of a letter to explicitly explain the "Doorway of decisions" is a convenient expository device that deflates mystery and lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a functional linear path to a valid closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the progression lacks causal density or surprising turns. The conflict resolution—reinterpreting a "threat" as a "summons"—lowers the tension retrospectively rather than escalating it through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking causal drive; Maren arrives with her realization already fully formed ("tonight she understood its purpose differently"), rendering the scene a lecture rather than a dramatic event. The closure is a restatement of the premise without a decisive change or paid cost, failing to reconfigure the stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure works for a meditative piece, and the orientation is solid. However, the narrative relies heavily on reflection-mode summary (grave, past dreams) rather than present-action pressure, reducing the immediate stakes of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure relies on a passive epiphany model where an object triggers a realization without active pressure or causal necessity. The closure ("Elena no longer mourned") is asserted rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path from struggle to mastery via a convenient epiphany triggered by the environment. Causality is soft; the mechanism of success (using the crystals/quill) operates on dream logic that lacks a grounded, earned transition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story achieves excellent closure via Resonant Reconfiguration; the apology is delivered "too late to matter" but recontextualizes the grief as a "clean break." The pacing is tight, utilizing the "induced currents" and the waking orchard as a precise clock that pressures the protagonist’s choice. The causality is clean, with the protagonist’s agency driving the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative reads as an extended exposition or prologue rather than a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end. There is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive closure on the page; the piece establishes a ritual but ends before any narrative change occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds a mood of reverence, leading to a legible moment of Earned Stasis. However, the narrative drive is low; the transition is routine, and the climax is a purely internal shift without external causality or urgent sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative acts as a static vignette where the inciting decision (leaving) occurs off-page, leaving only a low-stakes acknowledgment scene. While the "familiar strangers" dynamic is established, the "revolution" at closure feels asserted via narration—a Conceptual Repricing without a visibly paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The two-shard structure (library to hospital via subway) is clean and legible. The causal link between the cryptic subway scrawls and the specific epiphany ("stop playing and start living") is tenuous; the interpretation feels imposed by the author for thematic closure rather than strictly derived from the evidence Elara observes. The pacing is steady, though the climax resolves internal tension without significant external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story functions well as an atmospheric vignette with a clear "Charged Poise" closure where waiting shifts to action. However, the structure relies heavily on expository backstory ("She had been," "The job description said") rather than unfolding action, limiting narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a vignette with a "soft reset" ending; the regeneration of the covenant happens through internal assertion rather than narrative pressure. Closure relies on a stated promise without a visible cost or a causal turn that reconfigures the character's situation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal path (Quest -> Obstacle -> Realization -> Resolution), but the climax relies on a soft reset where the protagonist understands the solution "immediately," bypassing necessary narrative tension. The "improbable rumor chain" logic serves the setup well, but the resolution feels unearned due to the lack of on-page resistance or complication before the epiphany. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (the new mission), but the cost is low.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of sensory details rather than a causal chain of consequences. The resolution relies on a convenient external event ("pause of shifting constellations") rather than protagonist agency, and the closure lands as a soft conceptual realization without a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of effort without significant setbacks or tactical pivots; the solution arrives via a "time montage" ("For two hours, she traced...") rather than a dramatized causal struggle. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (validating the "wrong turn"), but the lack of resistance from the anomaly makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, building atmosphere toward the encounter with Elena. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanics—Elena arriving in a rowboat at night just as Marina practices—rely heavily on dream logic/coincidence rather than strict causality, softening the earned nature of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is a synopsis spanning years rather than a grounded scene, which dissipates tension. The climax is resolved by a convenient attribute ("gift guided her fingers") rather than earned causality or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist successfully bridges the gap to her sister. The narrative arc is linear with minimal obstruction, relying on a scheduled phenomenon (the "hush") rather than a forced choice or causal turn that alters the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is sound, with clear orientation and setup, but the climax is summarized ("By midnight, she had guided...") rather than dramatized. We are told of the struggle rather than shown the specific obstacles of the evacuation, which lowers the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece functions well as a "shard" under a Textural/Accumulative drive lens, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("stillwater tension"). Orientation is clear, and the dental mirror provides a solid causal anchor for the action. However, the narrative arc is extremely linear with minimal complication—the connection forms smoothly without the "tightening" or risk of failure that creates stronger narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative fails the fundamental requirement of a scene; it is a synopsis covering eleven years and recurring events without a specific temporal anchor or inciting incident. Because there is no dramatized "now," there is no structural closure, only a generalized thematic summary of success. The lack of a concrete timeline prevents any true causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a legible Decisive Change with the abandonment of the scrimshaw, satisfying the causal lens. However, the inciting incident (the whale arriving right "tonight") feels convenient, and the "violence impossible" constraint functions only as backstory rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is solid, effectively using a single scene to anchor the narrative. Closure lands clearly as "Earned Stasis"—a refusal of both grief and mandated joy—supported by the final image of the wooden rose. The situational drive lens holds firmly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression with low causal density; obstacles (the "force") dissolve instantly upon contact without forcing a change in tactics or imposing a cost. The closure—a conceptual realization—feels unearned because the barriers offered no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (gifting the reed tongue) is structurally sound, marking a clear change in the relationship. However, the progression is linear and low-friction, relying on a compliant secondary character to advance the plot without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("As the weeks passed") and exposition, failing to dramatize the struggle in a concrete scene. The closure—a conceptual realization about "inviting" connection—qualifies as Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of active obstacles or rising action leaves the journey feeling like a vignette rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and predictable, moving from anticipation to a ritualistic resolution without significant obstacles. While the closure (the walk through the curtains) is structurally distinct, it relies on a magical "fix" that bypasses the difficulty of the grief, lacking a strong sense of causal struggle or risk for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene is structurally sound, anchored effectively by the measuring tape ritual which creates a clear beginning, middle, and end. The closure lands as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where Soren's perspective shifts, though the "cost" of his confession is offered somewhat readily, reducing the dramatic tension of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear success sequence with sufficient orientation, but it lacks a distinct pivot point where failure is a genuine risk. The resolution—becoming the history—is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, yet it feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming resistance on the page. The "paradox" of the method is explained as backstory rather than solved in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows an accumulative drive, layering detail to build a mood, but the trajectory is static. The closure is a form of Earned Stasis (continuing the vigil), but because there is no sharp on-page pressure or turning point, the ending feels like a natural pause rather than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds well, using the physical repair to pace the internal processing. Closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of her stance toward the staff, though the flashback to Aldric is slightly long relative to the scene's length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully threads the backstory into the present action without stalling momentum. The closure is legible and complete (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the discovery of the handprints functions as a convenient key that unlocks the resolution, lowering the cost of the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc suitable for a vignette, effectively gathering emotional weight to a legible moment of closure (Earned Stasis). However, the progression is linear and lacks causal turns or complications; the "mystery" is solved instantly by magic, reducing narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Closure relies on a "soft reset" where the conflict vanishes simply because the protagonist stops trying, violating the requirement for visible or felt cost. The epiphany is convenient, dissolving the obstacle rather than transforming the character through consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative reads as a vignette rather than a structured story; the inciting incident (merchant's arrival) leads to a resolution (he leaves) without rising action or complication. The closure is soft, relying on a mutual nod rather than a decisive change or earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a low-resistance linear path: the protagonist finds a barrier, immediately applies the key he was given, and succeeds. The closure relies on a "magic key" resolution where the obstacle yields to a single attempt, lacking the causal friction or adaptation required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear allegorical logic but lacks concrete causality; obstacles are metaphorical ("valleys of memory") rather than actual plot events. The closure lands as a legible reconfiguration, but the journey toward it feels summarized rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a tight Accumulative lens, gathering sensory details and memories that culminate in a strong Conceptual Repricing of "safety." Closure is excellent: the decision to pocket the bolt and climb upward reconfigures the protagonist's stance with legible emotional and physical cost. The coincidence of the falling bolt initiates the plot but the protagonist's agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies entirely on exposition and summary of habitual action, lacking a specific scene with causal linkage or a defined timeline. Closure is a projection of a future off-page event ("one day"), failing to deliver a decisive change or reconfiguration in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving from a static routine to a disruption and finally a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's method. The inciting incident—the data anomaly—arrives with clear causality, and the closure (altering the tapping pattern) lands with legible conceptual cost: abandoning the old map for a new, uncertain reality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the stone circle's hum resolves the central conflict (the lull) without a causal tightening of options. The connection between the protagonist's waiting and the sudden activation of the stones is thematic rather than causal, lacking a legible cost for the shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.2)
    The arrival of the kite is a severe causal break; a pivotal solution (the map) drifts in by coincidence to resolve the central mystery, violating the rule that coincidence should complicate, not resolve. The climax relies on the plants explicitly explaining the plot ("telling her that the embryo was not a relic... but a key") rather than the protagonist earning the insight through action.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure works well for the subject matter, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the reliance on summary for the first 80% leaves the final scene feeling slightly rushed, and the "winter morning" vignette carries a heavy burden to resolve three years of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic, but the closure relies on a magical fix where untangling threads physically repairs a wooden box. The "walls closing in" threat evaporates the moment Mira engages with the cards, lacking a felt cost or sacrifice for the resolution. The ending works as a Conceptual Repricing, but the causality is soft, pivoting on a metaphorical realization that solves physical danger instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of arrival and immediate surrender, lacking significant reversals or obstacles that would escalate the plot. While the closure (disappearance) is legible and structurally sound, it feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a result of mounting pressure, functioning more as a scene sketch than a fully causal narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality relies on a deus ex machina: the dormant networks conveniently wake up "specifically for her shift" because the system "learned" she was ready. This removes agency from the inciting incident. The closure (sending the letter) lands, but the decision process is rushed and lacks a felt complication or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and habitual action ("When the first travelers came") rather than a dramatized scene with specific pressure. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, it restates her established philosophy without a fresh, on-page turning point or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from mystery to mastery with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The "garden whispered" exposition dump regarding the goddess's death is a minor shortcut that lowers the score slightly by telling rather than dramatizing the discovery. However, the ending lands with clear conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal drive, using the "proof by contradiction" to pivot the plot from reflection to resolution. The closure functions as a Charged Poise: Eleanor stands ready to dismantle the conspiracy, her internal stance decisively altered. The logic of the turn is tight and satisfies the setup without needing external deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative structure is a linear "fetch quest" devoid of complication; the protagonist arrives, finds the artifact immediately, and uses it without difficulty. The closure relies on a "magic button" device—rewriting the timeline to undo a death—which serves as a soft reset that resolves the central problem without exacting a visible or felt cost. This lack of causal friction and consequence reduces the plot to a wish-fulfillment sequence rather than a dramatized story.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the insertion of the tile. The "unlearning" frame is functional, though the resolution feels slightly convenient in its timing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situational path, but the "renaming" mechanic emerges conveniently at the climax without prior establishment of its rules or limits. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "aberrant mercy" feels more like a thematic assertion than a hard-won causal result.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly with the concept of "necessary failure," and the "fractured timeline" logic is taught effectively. However, the narrative arc is linear; the magical intervention solves the central problem without significant tactical complications or setbacks, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magic object" resolution where an accident instantly solves the central problem without protagonist agency or cost. The closure is a promise of future action ("She would devise") rather than a decisive change with felt consequences in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (explore, find, realize) but lacks causal friction or a Decisive Change with visible stakes. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of her role, yet without a felt cost or trade-off, the ending feels more like a summary of success than a dramatic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of discovery and validation without a decisive turning point or causality-driven tightening. The ending relies on a summary of external approval ("High Seers... found not a document") rather than a dramatized closure event with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (handover/internal realization) is legible. However, the reliance on a convenient backstory insert regarding the snow codes—revealed only when needed to solve the scene's logic—weakens the causal chain, and the resolution feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "wait and then board" structure with no causal turns or decisive change. The closure is a soft reset—the barge arrives inevitably, requiring no sacrifice, risk, or reconfiguration of stance from the character. The orientation is clear, but the lack of an on-page cost limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette rather than a story with causality; the protagonist encounters no obstacles and the ending is additive (gaining wisdom) rather than a resolution with felt cost. The circular structure reinforces stasis rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is a linear vignette that moves from observation to instruction without causal complication; the problem (grief) is solved by a single metaphor without resistance. While orientation is clear, the narrative lacks a drive lens that forces a hard choice, reading more like a parable than a dramatized story with distinct stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a low-stakes vignette where the central conflict is resolved by a convenient external arrival (the book) and an instantaneous internal realization. The ending lacks a "Decisive Change" with felt cost, operating instead as a soft reset where the problem vanishes because the character changes her mind without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear epiphany structure, pivoting on the discovery of the nest. While the "Conceptual Repricing" at the end is legible, the solution ("came to her whole") bypasses the struggle of decision-making, resulting in a closure that feels conceptually tidy but lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens (problem identified, solution calculated, solution enacted), but the resolution comes too easily. The "cosmic tricksters" are defeated by a single night of work without a "felt cost" or sacrifice from the protagonist, making the closure feel tidy but weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and low-friction; the central obstacle (spatial mutiny) is negated by the unerring compass, and the climax (musical paralysis) is resolved instantly by a convenient memory. The closure is a straightforward acquisition without a felt cost or complication to the protagonist's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative drive lens, gathering sensory impressions to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure that lands effectively. While the pacing is smooth, the narrative lacks a moment of doubt or significant causal complication, making the progression feel slightly linear and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative operates as a summary or montage of events (spanning years, then hours) rather than a continuous scene with real-time pressure. While the causal arc is coherent, the lack of immediate dramatization distances the reader from the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure functions as a frame-and-flashback, effectively anchoring the timeline despite the "three hours earlier" jump. However, causality relies entirely on magical coincidence—finding a museum artifact in a roadside pullout miles away from its source—which is accepted without investigation or cost. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that lands the image but lacks a felt price for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident (the offer) and a decisive closure (the choice to dissolve/restart). The drive lens (Causal/Persuasion) holds, though the turn relies heavily on a single metaphorical speech rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The timeline in the opening beat is blurry ("three summers ago" vs. "Tonight"), creating orientation debt; the narrative is a static reflection on past events rather than a causal chain of present-action consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution is procedural and lacks a sense of risk; Kaelen "expected" the shattering, removing tension from the climax. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of significant on-page obstacles makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment without meaningful friction or deviation; the outcome feels preordained. The closure is a change of state, but the cost is explicitly negated ("not painful"), rendering the sacrifice theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a legible cost. The "bartering" logic is established and paid off efficiently, though the prompt-driven mechanics (card falling on its own) feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting context of the TV failure to the specific pressure of the text message. The closure—a decision to physically move toward the trauma—is a decisive change that feels earned and carries legible emotional cost. The pacing effectively bridges the backstory with the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path with a clear closure (Conceptual Repricing), but the climax relies on the object delivering an expository download ("pages... told of a civilization"). The resolution feels granted by proximity rather than earned through narrative leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece is a static descriptive vignette rather than a story; it lacks an inciting incident, rising action, and a distinct closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration). The narrative describes a cycle of "Unearned Stasis" where tomorrow is mentioned but no cost is ever paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causality is linear and orientation is clear, but the closure relies on a convenient off-page "archive" that lowers the cost of the decision. The magical logic of the pearl is accepted without enough skepticism for an inspector character, smoothing over potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly. The reliance on the "epiphany via graffiti" trope acts as a convenient external solvent for internal complexity, making the resolution feel found rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of events (wait for midnight) rather than a causal chain driven by agency. The ending ("the story would not end there") avoids closure, offering a soft "new beginning" rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a valid Decisive Change at closure (lifting the bow). However, the causality relies on a convenient magical mechanism (reading the future in coffee) to externalize the stakes and force the choice, acting as a shortcut for organic character development. The "ticking clock" of the sunset provides effective structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is a linear procedural sequence that lacks the required Closure element of a decisive change with visible cost. The story reads as a successful task completion—she arrives, works, and succeeds—without a "Conceptual Repricing" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that alters the status quo or demands a price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure depends on a convenient epiphany triggered by a static visual pattern (clouds) rather than a causal chain of decisions. The resolution (Conceptual Repricing) feels unearned because there is no visible cost or active resistance overcome in the scene to reach the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.5)
    The reflection-led mode exceeds 50% of the text, stalling forward momentum and reducing the piece to a static vignette. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" of her own state, but it lacks a causal path of on-page actions to earn the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and effective within fable logic, moving cleanly from the stone's toss to the ripple's arrival. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the cost of the lesson (a lifetime of study), fulfilling the genre's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.9)
    The piece is a descriptive vignette rather than a narrative; it outlines a routine without a specific inciting incident, rising action, or causal turn. The ending relies on a summary of prior learning ("She had learned... that true navigation was not about...") rather than a dramatized structural closure rooted in today's events.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    Causality is weak; the story relies on a magical deus ex machina (the mist) to resolve the conflict between the protagonist and her environment. The ending functions as an escape that bypasses the established problem (the failing ward) without incurring a legible cost for abandoning her post. The narrative arc resets the character’s reality rather than reconfiguring it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.4)
    Causality suffers from a severe logic break: the ship is described as having "air to fill the... belly" yet Elias is later "floating" in the library, creating spatial contradiction. Additionally, the premise that paper books remain readable after three years of submersion breaks suspension of disbelief without a fantasy frame.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "Conceptual Repricing" ending, but the realization arrives without prior structural pressure or causality. The epiphany feels like a soft reset—an unearned shift in perspective—rather than a resolution forced by the tightening of the contracted universe.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is static, relying on a linear progression of listening to a recording and realizing a lesson without active causal complications. The closure ("she was not afraid") is an asserted internal shift that lacks a visible on-page cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (problem, realization, solution) but relies on a summary-heavy resolution ("villagers wept," "boats put out") that creates distance at the climax. The transition from observation to success is smooth, lacking a "try-fail" cycle or deepening complication to earn the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path that lacks a distinct turning point or causal tightening; the "resurfacing" confirms what she already knows rather than challenging it. Orientation is immediately compromised by the opening contradiction ("midnight ridgeway at twilight"), and the closure, while resonant, relies on a convenient discovery (the bottles) rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a realization, but the causality is weak; the breakthrough comes from looking at nature rather than a logical or pressurized sequence of actions. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("she had been the crystal all along"), but it lacks a visible, felt cost; she sheds her "mask" for a purely positive catharsis, missing the necessary trade-off for high drama.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal arc with functional "Earned Stasis" closure where competence preserves the status quo. The structure is efficient but linear, lacking a complicating twist or deep reconfiguration of the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    The resolution relies on a "magic feather" logic where the command "Vivify" and the knife strike instantly resolve the conflict without established causal groundwork. The "history rewriting" element is asserted as a background condition but never impacts the causal chain or constrains options, leaving the plot feeling disconnected from its own premise. Closure is achieved through assertion rather than an earned shift in tactics or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Days passed into weeks... months turned") rather than a specific scene, violating the scope defaults and diluting immediate tension. The climax is a realized concept within summary narration rather than a dramatized event, leaving the causality of the change feeling abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative operates as a static vignette rather than a story with a causal arc, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at the ending. The closure ("The work continued... as it always would") creates a loop without earned stasis or visible cost, merely postponing the resolution to an off-page future. The orientation is somewhat vague regarding the physical reality of the "household" versus the metaphorical tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending where the central problem (entrapment) is redefined as a "preparation" without any visible or felt cost. The causality is purely magical; the protagonist "interiorizes exteriors" to resolve seventeen years of stasis instantly. This lacks the requisite "decisive change" with consequences; the resolution is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear Decisive Change (destroying the relic), but the turning point relies on sudden internal realization ("sudden clarity") rather than active causal pressure. The closure lands with a defined cost, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to resolution, but the causality is soft; the protagonist succeeds instantly upon "tuning" without resistance or trial-and-error. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of friction makes the ending feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from inciting incident to resolution, but the causality at the climax is soft. The mechanism of stabilizing timelines by "holding the connection steady" with a radio is asserted rather than earned through established logic. Closure is achieved, but it feels like a low-stakes reset where the danger evaporates because the protagonist is simply good at her job.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, utilizing an Accumulative lens where the intensity of the weaving triggers the "eruption" and subsequent realization. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, creating an "Earned Stasis" where she accepts the ambiguity of her existence. Causality is intact; the magical reaction proceeds logically from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the Conceptual Repricing at the end (aliens as navigators, not saviors) lands effectively. However, the inciting incident for the closure—reading a message on a screen after the work is done—feels like a convenient delivery mechanism rather than a structural pressure point that drove the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative builds a causal chain (device -> heartbeat -> voice) but dissolves into ambiguity at the closure. Elena runs to "find" the message she just heard, but the ending implies she found it "waiting where the girl last stood," blurring whether she found a physical clue, a ghost, or just an echo. The logic of "Come find me" resolving into "they call to be heard" undercuts the urgency of the specific plea.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident (entry) and a decisive closure (dissolution into the network). The constraint of the tides effectively frames the window of opportunity, and the "phase transition" provides a legible mechanism for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure successfully builds a mood of reconciliation, though the heavy reliance on backstory (approx. 40-50%) slows momentum. Closure is distinct and resonant, utilizing a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the heartbeat counting ceases. The mechanics of the ink-to-digital translation remain abstract, operating on dream logic rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving logically from the canyon edge to the tunnel, but the resolution relies on a sequence of compliant magical elements rather than a hard-won turning point. The ending summarizes the result ("a new language was being born") rather than dramatizing the final transformation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene is coherent and the closure (stepping into the harmony) offers a clear conceptual shift, but the causality relies heavily on dream logic—e.g., the cordless phone working underground via "ghosts of static." The inciting arrival of the arrowhead via registered mail feels like a convenient setup device rather than an organic plot driver. The ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the build-up lacks causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic progression (bridge → orchard → music → awakening) that lacks causal friction or risk. The closure achieves a reconfiguration of the setting (the orchard wakes), but it fails the "cost" requirement of the rubric; Elara sacrifices nothing and faces no setback, resulting in a low-stakes "success" ending. The causality relies on convenience—the statues simply step aside, and the magic works on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly as Marcus redefines his role. The pacing is steady, though the transition to the reflection beat feels slightly mechanical and standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot relies on a "wrong turn" into a magical space, which is a coincidence that breaks causal credibility in a linear train setting. The closure—finding inspiration—lacks any visible or felt cost; the protagonist gains a treasure without sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative structure is coherent but lacks tension; it follows a procedural arc (drop-off, ritual, pickup) with a "symmetric satisfaction" ending. The closure solves the problem via magic without a legible cost or trade-off for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story operates primarily as a synopsis or montage, summarizing months of discovery rather than grounding the reader in a specific scene with causal urgency. While the ending provides a conceptual resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration), the lack of a concrete timeline or on-page struggle makes the closure feel unearned. The narrative leaps over the mechanics of the conflict to arrive at the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, but the linear sequence lacks a causal turn or obstacle; the resolution is a discovered message, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    Orientation and causality are solid, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the resolution relies on expository reflection to explain the protagonist's change, and the physical obstacle offers little active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vignette structure is coherent, framing the arrival within a clear "Situational" lens, but the central concept of "reversible exile" is explained in backstory rather than dramatized through a present-tense turn. The future-tense summary at the end dissipates the scene's tension instead of resolving it in the moment with a decisive on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks (pruning, preparing, planting) without a causal turn, obstacle, or cost. The ending offers a thematic restatement ("budding hope") rather than a structural closure where a price is paid or options are foreclosed. The lack of resistance or meaningful complication flattens the arc into a vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structural pivot revealing the net as a mask is excellent, creating a satisfying conceptual repricing at closure that recontextualizes the entire restoration process.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from archival discovery to site investigation and a valid closure of Earned Stasis. However, the logistical jump into the "missed" passage is glossed over, and the resolution lacks a sense of risk or cost, as the protagonist arrives possessing the wisdom she leaves with.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a significant plausibility break: a wax-sealed glass snow globe containing air and paper would implode instantly at trench depth, undermining the realistic "sonar" and "submersible" tone. Furthermore, the resolution is a soft reset where a lifetime of "ache" is cured instantly by a stranger's message.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks a decisive turn or obstacle; success feels inevitable. The closure is a "gift" moment (connection achieved) without a legible paid cost or sacrifice to earn the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    The elevator ascent provides a strong structural container that aligns temporal pressure with narrative pacing. However, the "childlike" cipher resolves the central obstacle too conveniently, reducing causal friction and making the middle beat feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a legible accumulative structure, moving from observation to realization. However, the closure—a decision to memorialize—lacks a palpable cost or "decisive change" on the page; the "spiral pattern" appearing exactly when needed feels like a convenient pathetic fallacy rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid and the closure valid, but the midpoint obstacle (the safe) yields too easily to "careful manipulation," missing a chance for causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a convenient coincidence where starlings, light, and a random hopscotch board perfectly align, lacking sufficient causal groundwork. While the orientation is clear, the closure—a simple successful calculation—lacks the felt cost required for higher impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path of prophecy fulfillment where instructions are found and immediately executed without complication. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (sacrifice leads to destiny), but the problem and solution are perfectly matched by the prophecy, removing causal friction. The orientation is clear, but the plot lacks a decisive turning point driven by high-stakes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is a synopsis-style montage spanning months, violating the short story scope of a distinct scenic window. Causality is soft and accumulative; closure is a "happy ending" resolution (rain falls) that feels inevitable rather than earned through a decisive, costly on-page act.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear progression of a ritual without causality-driven reversals or unexpected obstacles. Closure is a "soft reset" that feels inevitable rather than earned by agency; the ending offers satisfaction but lacks a felt price or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear and the closure (path opening) is a decisive change. The discovery of the blueprint "searching for something else entirely" is a convenient backstory patch to explain her knowledge, but the mechanism of the climax works within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a static "standing and thinking" structure where the climax is an internal realization triggered by scenery rather than active pressure. A jarring, unmotivated tense shift at the pivot ("The pieces fall into place as she watched") destabilizes the timeline and breaks the closure unit’s causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative functions as a linear vignette or mood piece rather than a story with a causal spine; the progression from arrival to realization encounters no obstacles. Closure is a "net gain" realization (her slates are possibilities) that lacks the visible or felt cost required for a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to diagnosis to resolution with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The primary weakness is the reliance on a montage ("The work took three days") for the central conflict, which flattens the rising action into a procedural summary. The causality is functional—she analyzes, cooks, and heals—but lacks a decisive "pinch" point where the outcome is genuinely in question on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary for pivotal beats, particularly the reconciliation of the Antonescu brothers ("The work took weeks"), which deflates the climax. While the closure is legible as a decisive change, the lack of an on-page cost or trade-off limits the dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative structure lacks causality; the central action is resolved through a summary montage ("worked through the night") rather than a dramatized process. The ending is a "Soft Reset" where a magical realization solves the character's direction without testing her agency or competence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from entry to realization (Resonant Reconfiguration) within a clear window. The "junction" choice relies on a somewhat convenient intuition ("shapes most like letters") rather than a forced trade-off, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain is coherent (find → analyze → build → play), but the narrative lacks a distinct tightening beat where success is in doubt. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (silence broken), but without a visible or felt cost paid on the page, the resolution feels virtually unopposed. Orientation and pacing are stable.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure functions as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" vignette, with the protagonist accepting his state. However, the heavy reliance on a reflective block in the middle (the queen's backstory) stalls momentum, and the inciting incident for the scene itself is somewhat vague.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a soft causal link where the external event (the firework) conveniently provides the solution (the hidden note) exactly when needed. The closure comes via a diary entry that summarizes the lesson rather than a dramatic action that demonstrates it, reducing the ending's impact to an explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story relies on a synopsis-like structure ("For weeks...") to bridge the inciting incident and climax, violating the scope default of a continuous scene or mosaic. This summary mode dilutes causal tension, as the pivotal transformation occurs in a time-lapse rather than through immediate, pressurized action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on a "magic touch" epiphany (the chorus of echoes) to deliver exposition and resolve the mystery, bypassing dramatized discovery. Closure is technically present (leaving the object) but lacks a felt cost or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clean investigative arc under a Causal/Accumulative lens, building to a strong Conceptual Repricing of the evacuation. The mystery of the silence is resolved not by a jump scare but by a physics-based realization that recontextualizes the town's actions. The closure lands effectively, though the "cost" is primarily abstract (intellectual vindication) rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual enactment with no obstacles or logical friction. The closure is "Symmetric Satisfaction," resolving the global stake perfectly without any legible cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is legible, leading to a clear internal reconfiguration at the junction. However, the narrative is static, relying on a high volume of backstory reflection (Oresta, grandmother) to fill the present frame, which dilutes immediate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative traces a clear arc from work to transcendence, but the middle section relies heavily on expository reflection (~30% of text) to explain the methodology rather than dramatizing it in the moment. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the transition is smooth to the point of inevitability, lacking a "tightening" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is coherent, leading to a Conceptual Repricing of the courier's role. However, the closure lacks a felt cost; the text explicitly states the realization "didn't hurt," which softens the impact of the mentor's final departure and makes the resolution feel like a gift rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear Accumulative structure, but the causality is low-pressure; the protagonist arrives, looks, and understands without obstacle. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks proof and finds it—lacking the requisite felt cost or "no, and" complication for high-band literary fiction. The forecasting in the first paragraph ("today would be the day") deflates potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, but the climax relies on a sudden epiphany ("She understood now") rather than causal pressure. The logic is purely assertive—the puzzle edges and bead work because the story says they do—leaving the mechanics of the "message" and its reception abstract and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on broad narrative summary ("three seasons past," "years before," "awakenings came slowly") rather than a dramatized scene, which violates the scope default and distances the reader from the causal mechanics of the closure. The climax is recounted rather than shown, reducing the immediate impact of the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves legibility and closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kira reframes her purpose. The causal pivot—seeing her other self and instantly deducing the "withheld truth" is internal—feels slightly rushed and relies on a leap of logic rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the problem is solved by a sudden realization that lacks on-page causality or trial-and-error. The resolution—stacking stones to fix a mechanical lamp—relies on magical convenience without establishing the rules or exacting a tangible cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece functions as a vignette rather than a story, lacking an inciting incident, rising action, or a closure unit with visible cost. The narrative is a linear description of a successful routine without a decisive turn or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a "Looking at Thing" structure where a static protagonist observes an object and gains wisdom. While the ending offers a legible Conceptual Repricing of "mastery," the lack of causal friction or active testing of the hypothesis results in a low-energy narrative with minimal momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story functions as a strong atmospheric vignette under an Accumulative lens, successfully teaching the reader how the labyrinth works. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—understanding that maintenance is unmaking—but the inciting "pin drop" implies an urgency that the meditative structure doesn't fully pay off. It resolves thematically rather than causally.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear ritualistic arc leading to a Decisive Change (the return of light and Elara's transformation). The causality is sound within the magical logic, and the closure lands with a defined conceptual cost (loss of memory for the sake of hope).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is coherent with clear orientation, but the closure relies on a deferred action ("Tomorrow, she would") rather than an immediate, costly move. The resolution is an internal recalibration (Resonant Reconfiguration) that feels intellectually tidy but lacks a visible on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story is a vignette lacking causal progression; the arrival of the bread is an isolated event that does not force a new tactic or consequence. Closure is a return to the status quo (Earned Stasis) but lacks a visible cost or a foreclosed alternative path to give it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Conceptual Repricing closure (magic becoming story), which is legible and structurally sound. However, the plot lacks a decisive inciting incident within the scene; the conflict is resolved through passive realization rather than active problem-solving or tactical pivots, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a "looking forward" ending that defers resolution to a future moment; additionally, the untranslated text artifact disrupts the description of the central object, breaking the causal chain of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on the "convergence" artifact to resolve the search by coincidence rather than agency. Closure is a "soft reset" epiphany where the protagonist adopts a new worldview ("learning, finally") without paying a visible price or navigating a dilemma that forces the change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is functional but depends on a convenient environmental coincidence (the shaft of light) to trigger the climax rather than protagonist agency. The heavy reliance on retrospective realization stalls forward momentum, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through present-action tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on backstory in the first third to establish stakes, which delays the present-action momentum. While the transition from the workshop to the hidden room provides a coherent accumulative arc, the "museum tour" nature of the plot—go to place, see thing, feel feeling—lacks causal tightening. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there is low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative lacks a structural arc, functioning instead as a descriptive vignette with no causal momentum. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—a reaffirmation of the status quo—without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. It is a portrait of stasis that feels unearned because no obstacle was overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story relies on dream logic where folding abstract fears somehow repairs the roses' corrupted nutrient regulators, lacking a necessary causal bridge. The resolution feels convenient—her "gift" for containment solves the problem without a tactical pivot—and the cost is framed as a spiritual gain, softening the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on convenience and summary rather than dramatized causality; Mrs. Okonkwo delivers the backstory immediately upon request, and the climax (the sister's reunion) occurs off-stage in summary. Closure is unearned because no obstacle was overcome to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a structural turning point; it proceeds from arrival to execution to success without complication. The closure (freedom) is a decisive change, but the "felt cost" required for high-band scoring is absent on the page, having been paid entirely in the backstory. The pacing is steady but flat, functioning more as a victory lap than a dramatic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic path with a "gift" ending where the protagonist gains insight without paying a visible cost. The logic of the magic system (coffee grounds mapping gravity) is asserted rather than demonstrated in a way that drives causal turns. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (accepting a new identity) but lacks the requisite "felt cost" to land with impact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of prophecy as warning) lands effectively. The progression is somewhat linear and low-friction, relying more on meditative procedural steps than causal complications.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a domestic inciting incident to a cosmic climax (meteor shower) that acts as a crucible for the truth. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to embrace the "agreed-upon lies" provides a satisfying, costly resolution that recontextualizes the entire relationship. The pacing perfectly mirrors the deepening intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative structure is solid, with clear orientation and a legible causal chain leading to a distinct resolution. However, the middle section relies heavily on static exposition and backstory reflection to bridge the gap between discovery and epiphany, slowing the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure with no complications; the "magic wall" crumbling at the end breaks the established reality of the scene without setup. The Archive Keeper’s instructions (chest, key) are contradicted by the ending (no chest, key unused) in a way that feels like a continuity error rather than a twist.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails to provide the required on-page closure, ending on a "threshold" moment where answers are promised but not delivered. The narrative consists almost entirely of expositional summary leading to an inciting incident, lacking a complete arc or a decisive change with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on retrospective summary and exposition, lacking a dramatized scene with present-moment causality. The ending is a statement of future intent ("She would find") rather than an on-page closure event or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.7)
    The piece functions as a lyrical vignette (Situational lens) rather than a narrative with causal drive. While the closure—whistling to complete the pattern—is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, it lacks felt cost or irrevocable change. The story observes a state of being rather than dramatizing a shift in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    The transition "Over the following weeks" collapses the rising action and climax into a summary montage, robbing the story of a dramatized discovery scene. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, the structural reliance on time-lapse summary to solve the mystery deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative reads as an inciting incident or prologue rather than a complete short story; the ending provides a change in situation (arrival) but lacks a legible closure unit with felt or conceptual cost. The "cost" of isolation is paid in backstory, not in the scene, leaving the climax—the figure stepping through the glass—feeling like a setup for a longer work rather than a resolved arc. Causality is situational, driven by the storm's intensity rather than the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on coincidence (the granddaughter arriving immediately after the discovery) to resolve the central mystery. The ending dissolves into a summarized account of the poet's future career rather than a dramatized scene of the new status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path from threat to resolution without significant deviation or cost; the climax resolves via technical proficiency (tuning the key) rather than a hard trade-off, making the closure feel tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent but linear, lacking significant causal complications or resistance; events unfold because the timeline dictates them. While the ending provides a Decisive Change (the unyoking), it feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page maneuvering. The closure lacks a felt price, as the "patience" was paid in backstory rather than the current scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central mystery is resolved via a *deus ex machina* (psychic memories) rather than the protagonist's established skills or agency. This shift breaks the narrative promise of a forensic investigation and renders the earlier "empirical" setup irrelevant to the outcome. The closure is a result of information gifted to the protagonist, not earned through the causal chain of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean, linear path with a functional flashback that informs the present action. Closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the repaired object carries new, hidden meaning, satisfying the causal drive established by the customer's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building from the acquisition of the tip to the ringing of the bell. Orientation is excellent. However, the closure—while thematically resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration)—lacks a sharply felt cost on the page; the "madness" and isolation are accepted too easily, making the final triumph feel inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    The investigation proceeds linearly with minimal resistance; the narrative bypasses the central obstacle ("corporate firewalls that should have been impenetrable") in a single sentence without dramatized effort. While the closure suggests a shift in stance, the lack of causal friction in the middle reduces the earned weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot operates on dream logic and coincidence—the shop "materializes," and the shopkeeper hands over the key prop without communication. Closure relies on an unearned epiphany ("understood instinctively") and a pathetic fallacy where the weather changes to match Mira's internal state. Causality is weak; the resolution is mental, not active.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    A clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the "windborne solace" confirming her readiness. The structure effectively uses the accumulative weight of the wreckage to earn the internal shift, though the progression feels linear and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is overwhelmingly reflection-led (>50%), using the present timeline merely as a static frame for backstory summary. The "turn" occurs entirely within memory and abstract realization rather than through a pressured on-page event or interaction. The ending is a "soft reset" where acceptance arrives because the reflection concludes, not because a path was foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a vignette lacking a structural turn; the pivotal moment of meaning (the answer to the questioner) occurs in backstory, leaving the present action as a low-stakes loop.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-energy structure (arrival, task, departure) that functions as a vignette rather than a story with causality. Closure is weak and purely internal, relying on projected emotions ("felt the photograph's subjects watching her") rather than a verifiable change or paid price. The orientation is adequate, but the lack of narrative drive or meaningful reconfiguration limits the scope significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, moving from observation to interaction (the crystal) to a conceptual reframing of "growth." The closure—Conceptual Repricing where growth is understood as completion—is earned and resonant. The orientation is excellent, anchoring the reader immediately in the specific post-lexical world.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, using the driftwood markers to create a linear path toward the center and the epiphany. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the stake from longing to peace. While the logic of the "precognitive" markers is slightly circular (setting answers before forgetting the question), the magical realist frame supports it well enough to deliver a cohesive ending.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the narrator's relationship to the spinning hand. However, the external resolution—the mountain tremor ceasing solely because of an internal epiphany—reads as a convenient pathetic fallacy that weakens causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving from the inciting diagnosis directly into a scene that tests Elara's new reality. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration; Margery's recognition ("You're not just humming") forces a shift in status that allows Elara to integrate her mortality with her work. The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds firmly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.0)
    The inciting discovery relies on extreme convenience; finding the exact key needed "beneath a shelf" reduces the protagonist’s agency to luck rather than scholarly deduction. While the closure form (Conceptual Repricing of the shadow) is valid, the causal chain leading to it is weak and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative drive, building density through memory and setting before releasing it in the ritual act. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the refusal of the Ministry's ending in favor of her own ritual creates a distinct before/after state. The pacing is controlled, though the magical reaction at the end risks feeling slightly convenient without prior mechanical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the climax relies on the convenient discovery of a magical object that resolves the central conflict without tactical difficulty. The ending dissolves into a summarized epilogue ("In the weeks that followed..."), distancing the reader from the specific moment of change. The "realization transformed everything" beat feels like a shortcut through the necessary narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid, utilizing a retrospective reflection anchored effectively by the pendant to transition into the backstory. The closure lands as a form of Earned Stasis—choosing to withhold truth to protect the mother—which is legible, though the scene relies heavily on the internal processing of past events rather than immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is linear and lacks strong causal pressure; the resolution (an epiphany triggered by a spectral toast) arrives without a visible cost or complication. The "feral nexus" acts as a convenient stage for the encounter rather than a pressure cooker that forces a structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear task-completion sequence (wait, plant, sing, bloom) that lacks a structural turn, complication, or cost. The ending offers "Success" rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration; everything goes exactly to plan, resulting in a low-stakes vignette rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic (gather, arrange, seal) leading to a legible closure of Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the progression is linear and procedural without significant reversals or unexpected obstacles, resulting in a somewhat low-stakes resolution where the cost is theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative traces a clear arc from investigation to a "Conceptual Repricing" closure where the broken timer is redefined as a vessel for wonder. The pacing is smooth and the orientation is solid. The structure works well as a lyrical vignette, though the lack of external obstacles makes the causal chain feel somewhat inevitable rather than earned through plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative lens, teaching the pattern of collecting, weaving, and calcifying. While the closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (deepening into the wall), the narrative is linear and procedural, lacking a decisive turn or complication to test the protagonist’s resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is elegant, utilizing the boiling and cooling kettle as a natural timer for the scene. The closure is earned and tangible—the insertion of the glass eyes marks a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" of her grief into art.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative drive lens works well, with the camera's increasing weight creating a clear physical escalation that leads to the ghost's appearance. The closure (Earned Stasis) lands with a legible conceptual cost—accepting exhaustion over resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the story's structural climax (the City Council presentation), dissolving tension exactly where it should peak. The leap from discovery to approval ("By noon... That evening... The following week") flattens the causal arc into a list of events without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" where the bear’s passive presence generates a massive internal shift without causal necessity. The drive lens is situational, but the resolution lacks a "felt cost"; the key is simply used because the mood felt right, making the closure feel convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative line from waiting to realization, maintaining legible causality. However, the closure relies on a low-stakes conceptual shift ("serene upheaval") rather than a decisive change with cost; the puzzle is solved too smoothly to generate narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-causality path where a tool simply solves the intellectual problem without complication. Closure relies on a "Conceptual Repricing" (the rope becomes philosophy), but lacks the required on-page cost to make the shift resonant. The ending is a soft landing that summarizes a theme rather than resolving a dramatic question.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative functions as a cohesive vignette under an Accumulative lens, successfully landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the traveler accepts her role; however, the lack of active attempts to resolve the stranding makes the plot feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible under an Accumulative lens, but the climax suffers from a lack of earned causality. The solution—glowing veins spelling out explicit instructions—functions as a Deus Ex Machina that bypasses the protagonist's agency in solving the central mystery. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) is present but feels handed to the character rather than forged by him.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure is legible, moving from sensory grounding to memory and resolution, but the scene lacks a distinct inciting incident or obstacle beyond the need to think. The closure acts as a conceptual repricing of her father's legacy, but it arrives via smooth rumination rather than a pressurized turn, resulting in low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is a linear fetch quest where solutions (understanding the breadcrumbs' purpose) arrive via convenient intuition rather than earned deduction. While the closure is technically complete, the causal chain relies on dream-logic that feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the ritual is altered. However, the pivot relies on a sudden realization that explains away the conflict ("not malfunctioning but remembering") rather than causal pressure forcing a change. The resolution feels convenient, lacking a moment where the outcome was truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path that functions more as a vignette than a driven story. Closure is achieved through a summary of understanding ("Elara understood now...") rather than a decisive turn or action, which weakens the impact of the final image. The orientation and pacing are competent, but the lack of causal friction makes the epiphany feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, utilizing the clock winding ritual to frame the narrative arc. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, confirming his burden rather than removing it. The "37 seconds" mechanic provides a clear window, though the backstory integration (the accident) is handled via a dense summary block that briefly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative suffers a catastrophic structural failure with the inclusion of a meta-comment ("But the story must end... let me revise") and a verbatim restart of the ending. This breaks the causal chain and destroys the fictional frame, rendering the piece unpublishable. The plot is a linear progression of discovery without complication or earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative fails to form a complete story, functioning instead as a prologue or atmospheric set-piece. There is no on-page closure (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration); the transition from standing to writing lacks a shift in stakes, knowledge, or stance to constitute a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative functions as a vignette rather than a story, lacking a causal chain or meaningful escalation. The ending—a validation of the premise that dust remembers—fails to provide a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the protagonist ends exactly where she began.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Accumulative drive lens works well, using the ritual to build density toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation is solid, and the stopping of the rocking chair provides a distinct, earned closure signal that reconfigures the room's energy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece functions as a descriptive vignette or prologue rather than a story with a causal arc; there is no inciting incident or rising action, only reflection. Closure is an "Earned Stasis" (reaffirming the work) but lacks a visible, paid cost within the scene's window to give it weight. The narrative lens is accumulative, but the stakes are not reweighted by the artifact, only confirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure is functional but unbalanced, with the first half dominated by reflective backstory that slows momentum before the scene begins. While the ending provides a resonant image (the student relaxing, the rosette), the causal link is weak; the transformation feels inevitable rather than earned through specific on-page tactics or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a "once-in-a-lifetime" coincidence to enable the climax, acting as a convenient key rather than a pressure cooker. Closure is achieved through a "fix-it" ending where the protagonist gains power and purpose without a legible on-page cost or sacrifice, reducing the narrative to a linear path of acquisition.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where reading a riddle repairs a mechanical infrastructure failure without establishing the causal rules for such a shift. This ending bypasses the required "felt or conceptual cost," resolving high stakes (a citywide blackout) with a low-effort action that feels unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    A coherent accumulative design where sensory details build effectively to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is solid, and the pacing fits the contemplative mode, though the ending feels slightly inevitable rather than earned through a sharp narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to inciting incident (ampoule) to a conceptual closure (welcoming the diver). However, the climax lacks resistance; the diver serves merely as a prop to demonstrate Thalassor’s new setting, resulting in a low-tension resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the prison is reframed. The pivot point relies on a convenient coincidence—the dice landing on the exact formula needed—which weakens the sense of earned discovery despite the thematic fit of probability.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent, but the resolution hinges on a magical coincidence (moonlight triggering a specific vision) rather than protagonist action. The puzzle of the language solves itself because the conditions were right, weakening the causal chain and reducing the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the "thaw" as an inciting incident that forces a Decisive Change at the end. The closure is solid, with Maren actively choosing exposure over safety, though the "voices outside" act as a slightly convenient pressure mechanism to force the immediate exit.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the hunger stone's warning to the final dissolution, holding the Causal/Situational lens well. The "weeks of careful analysis" summarized in the middle slightly saps immediate scene tension, but the closure—a decisive unmaking of reality—lands with undeniable conceptual weight and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the inciting warning to the confrontation and resolution. The closure is distinct (curse lifted, inner peace found), though the mechanics of the "advisor" fading and the curse breaking feel slightly convenient for the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear demonstration of ability—a ritual performed successfully—rather than a causal chain of choices under pressure. While the ending offers a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the wave into music, it lacks the required felt or conceptual cost to give the closure narrative weight. The story functions more as a static vignette than a developing plot.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causality is legible, leading to a strong Decisive Change with the waking turtles. However, the solution relies heavily on backstory competence ("learned to crack the code") rather than active, high-stakes problem-solving on the page, which flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story functions as a static vignette rather than a dramatic scene; the protagonist stands in one spot and reflects on backstory and themes until reaffirming a decision made prior to the scene ("crystallized her resolve" three days ago). While the orientation is clear, the lack of present-tense interaction or escalating tactical choices flattens the narrative drive. The closure is a logical conclusion to the reflection but lacks a dynamic causal path within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.5)
    The closure lands structurally as a conceptual redefinition, but the physical causality is wobbly. The setup claims she will be "cut off for hours" once the tide turns—a fate she accepts—but she simply wades out later despite the rising water. This contradiction deflates the declared physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative structure leads to a valid realization ending, but the plot relies heavily on convenience, such as the immediate discovery of the manuscript behind a false panel. The narrative moves linearly from observation to confirmation without significant obstacles or twists. The closure works as a "Charged Poise," but the path there feels unearned by the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece functions as a polished vignette under an Accumulative lens, effectively using the "Earned Stasis" closure model where the cost is the ongoing "luminous torment." The structure relies heavily on reflective exposition (BRR) anchored by the polishing action. While the closure is conceptually resonant, the narrative arc is internal and retrospective rather than driven by present-tense causality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette driven by reflection, which fits the meditative scope but limits causal propulsion and active pressure. Closure lands as a valid "Earned Stasis"—a reaffirmation of the hunt—but the reliance on heavy backstory (the wedding) outweighs present-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with minimal resistance; obstacles like the sealed station are bypassed without struggle. The closure relies on an internal realization ("she was already home") that feels unearned because no visible or felt cost is paid on the page to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality relies on a significant convenience: finding a specific physical object (her father’s watch hand) on a random "forgotten shore" to resolve the central mystery. The logic of how this metal object arrived among "driftwood carvings" is muddy, acting as a convenient key to unlock the closure rather than an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a clear closure event (dropping the pulls), but the arc lacks causal density; the outcome is a symmetric agreement reached without complication or cost in the moment. The resolution ("weight of three generations was gone") feels unearned because the scene offers no resistance to the characters' intentions. It reads as a ceremonial enactment rather than a plot with genuine turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is sound with a clear inciting incident and a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the protagonist accepts a new navigational reality. The "sister's call" flashback provides necessary context without derailing the present scene, though the resolution feels slightly swift given the weight of the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central conflict; the navigation of the "maze of choices" is glossed over ("Vera moved through... with patience") rather than dramatized. The climax consists of a secondary character explaining the protagonist's success, resulting in a lack of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the established stakes (loss of humanity) are negated by a convenient realization that it is actually an "expansion." This lowers the earned value of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, following a clear Accumulative/Textural lens where ritual elements build pressure. Closure is achieved through a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (cutting the hand to release rather than gather), though the mechanism of the realization—visions swirling in the air—feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, building density through the stitching ritual to a resonant closing image. While the causality works on a lyrical level, the closure lacks a "visible or felt cost" on the page—the transition feels like a frictionless reward rather than a consequence of difficult sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a thematic realization, but the closure relies on an "explain-everything" summary rather than dramatized change. The epiphany is asserted by the narrator ("she understood then what the monks had meant") rather than earned through a high-pressure choice or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot hinges on the immense coincidence that Elara’s standard-issue gear contains a hidden manual she discovers only now due to a blackout. The resolution is an easy win without setbacks, as the puzzle solves itself through "resonance" and convenient intuition rather than deductive struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central premise (loss of friction) is fundamentally contradicted when the protagonist's feet "find purchase" on "frictionless stone" during the pivotal climb. This violation of the story's own physical rules undermines the logic of the inciting action and the climax. The closure works emotionally but rests on shaky Causal ground.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (writing on the mist) lands a valid Conceptual Repricing where ephemerality becomes a form of freedom. The "realization" beat, however, feels like an inserted epiphany ("realized that the vigil had not been about...") rather than a realization forced by immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a requisite closure cost; Varn triumphs without sacrifice or significant adaptation. The climax relies on abstract summary ("superior understanding," "opening... in his philosophy") rather than dramatized causality, resolving the conflict through a mental declaration rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, resolving in a resonant moment of "Earned Stasis," but a significant summary bridge weakens the center. The narrative summarizes the pivotal discussion ("As they talked, Mira began to understand that the blooming resistance...") rather than dramatizing the exchange, skipping the causal trigger for the protagonist's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible under an accumulative lens, moving from preparation to ritual execution. However, the mid-story exposition block explaining the film reels ("The method... had taken him eighteen months") halts momentum and functions as a retroactive manual rather than active discovery. Closure lands effectively with a Resonant Reconfiguration, freezing him in his desired moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear linear drive from workbench to ridge, supported by a functional ticking clock (monsoon). Closure is legible and valid, but the resolution feels slightly soft as the solution "blooms" in the protagonist's mind without a prior tactical failure or difficult trade-off to earn the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, moving from observation to epiphany, but the mechanism of the compass aligning with a specific thread relies on unexplained magical convenience that undercuts the emotional earnedness. Closure is present (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the "cost" is minimal, as the resolution feels gifted by the environment rather than wrestled from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the golden fingerprint reweights her entire cosmology. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns slowly reconfigure meaning—cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 45; no lens ambiguity. One causal gap: the aunt’s philosophy is introduced late and never dramatized, so the greenhouse comparison feels imported rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the ledger tucked to her heart reconfigures her from prey to pursuer with conceptual cost legible. Accumulative lens holds: frost patterns and ledger notations tighten into a single usable map. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalties. The turn relies on an off-page jump—“she understood finally”—rather than a causal beat shown; this keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: each thermal reading layers emotional residue until the final image reweights silence itself as readable music. Closure is a Charged Poise—she gives up on sound-return and embraces “architecture of feeling,” a conceptual cost the prose makes legible in the last two sentences; causality keeps its shape, no late convenience.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Winterglass conservatory” is never just backdrop; the frost-lattice, frozen ferns, and pulsing thermal strata literally channel her method and supply the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crosses wings; cold/warm shifts act as both obstacle and archive, constraining where she can map next.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The arrival-of-box inciting incident teleports Aldric to an impossible drowned library, a causal leap that the text legitimizes by anchoring the lens as both ticket and task; orientation inside the underwater space is taught through bodily disorientation rather than exposition. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the once-broken lens whole again, now broadcasting an endless signal he is fated to answer—cost is the lifelong vigil he accepts in exchange for purpose restored. No outline drift, no retro-patching; every beat follows the “because/therefore” of a man summoned to midwife the forgotten dead.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: bell-ringing reweights exile from loss to continuation, cost legible in Mira’s tacit acceptance that sanctions may outlive her. Causal chain holds—anonymous runs → trust surplus → arbor gathering → mentorship pledge—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation locked within first 70 words. One micro-transition (shift from past reflection to present arbor) is legible via bell cue. No teleport, no amnesia; persistent constraint of water-scarce ridge shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: unused love is released, viaduct exhales—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by word 60; no penalty. Causality inside the memory bleed is slightly elliptical—why this viaduct, why tonight?—but the pattern teaches early that “breathing calls the light,” so the final transfer is earned. Drive lens holds without contradiction; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the piece tightens once: photographs → halo glimpse → dirt-drawn maze. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden “leaned forward to listen,” re-weighting her stance and foreclosing retreat. Orientation is swift; causality never breaks; cost is legible in the charged poise of the final image. A hairline slip: the temporal “circuit” mechanism stays metaphoric, nudging down from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine is legible: wall falls → Mira reaches vault → will wait, then plant. The piano-bench cipher delivers a clean Decisive Change (door opens) with visible effort (chains, three-year study). Orientation is anchored by word 70; no penalty. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she will stay hidden, pay time later—so cost is conceptual but undeniable under the inferred Causal lens. The only hairline slip: the arrow-sigil beat appears at the vault threshold without prior motive, slightly softening the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the device reframes trust-loss as audible silence, reweighting her world-rule with undeniable cost—"what exactly are we hearing when we hear the end of something?" The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds; aurora/greenhouse density tightens to a charged poise without causal reversals, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the poured moonbeam re-weights the man’s future, crystallized in the garden-of-camellias image. Causality is lyrical‐textural: each beat accumulates sensory density until the final re-interpretation. Orientation is swift; the emerald station, amber light, and lone bench are anchored by word 80. The cost is felt in the man’s “heaviness lifting,” but Mira’s own stakes never tighten; that keeps the piece just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the finished vessel and scarred bookmark together reweight his rule-set—protection without imprisonment—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent; each thaw image (dripping eaves, softening glass) deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the final image (“prepared to begin again” now costs him his glacier armor). A tighter micro-turn mid-scene would lift this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: shell → voice → cast → coordinates → confrontation → renunciation. Orientation achieved by 80 words; no debt incurred. The single-scene default is met; the cast functions as both prop and decrypting tool, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure—her identity map is rewritten with undeniable social cost. Lens stays causal throughout; no amnesia or teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (flaking gold, last star, storm pause) tightens the stake of “map the night” until the charcoal stroke becomes the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the booklet closed, darkness arriving, oracle dead—with undeniable conceptual cost: the world must now inhabit her silence. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“highest parapet of the ridge fort”); no ambiguity or teleportation; pattern of silence taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: looping dusk + music tighten the stake of self-continuity. Closure is a Charged Poise—“accepting the flow”—but no new constraint or price is felt; the moment is serene, not costly. Orientation is clear by word 60; no causal break, yet no escalation that forecloses an option. The violin simply appears and is used; it does not complicate or limit later action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored symbols (ticket doodles, lens, crystal walls) tightens toward the hand-touch that refracts trust across the forecourt. Closure is Charged Poise—registrar’s first drawn reply crystallizes new possibility while the approaching crowd refracts stakes. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is legible: the ledger remains wordless, the registrar’s anonymity forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of pocketed, cracked marbles reweights the entire textural accumulation, making the cost of her lifelong vigil legible without exposition. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned polishing, planting, commemoration—tightened by autumn’s decay note. Transitions are seamless; orientation is anchored by line 3. One minor soft spot: the investor deception is recounted rather than rendered, so causality feels second-hand, but this beat does not touch the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure lands a clean conceptual re-pricing—time is sideways—delivered through holographic display and ARIA’s confirmation, with the station itself as persistent constraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tightening is a density increase in temporal bleed evidence rather than a because/therefore turn, but the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The lever pull sequence is effectively the single deepening required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is legible: rising water → program bleeds → reveals cipher → Elena plays → ghost message received. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no penalty. The water-as-reveal mechanism is externally magical but internally consistent; closure is Earned Stasis—she leaves, carrying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Persistent constraint (flood destroys the physical score) shapes the final tactic and images, satisfying the 9+ quick test; only minor slack appears in mid-story exposition recaps.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s fingers on the keys crystallise a new operational stance—“certainty as collection of margins”—with felt cost (the swallowed stone of guilt). Causal linkage holds: because she touches the smudge → therefore reweights certainty → therefore transmits the warning. Accumulated aurora/illustration imagery reconfigures meaning without external resolution. Persistent constraint: the storm she once mis-read now becomes the first she faces under her new epistemic rule, cost locked into the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final hush reweights every prior beat and forecloses Marcus’s silence forever. Causal chain holds—forum tip → hatch → wheel → ghost shift → radio → confession—each step shrinking options. Orientation is secure by word 80. The wheel turns without touch: one irreducible fantastic pivot; accepting it is the price of admission and the story commits.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: cyclical movement between library/refuge, accumulating weight of seasons. Closure is a Charged Poise—the keeper seated “at the intersection,” paper swan in lap—where meaning is re-weighted but no path is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual (endless witness) not viscerally felt, keeping it below 9-band. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal reversals occur, but coherence is maintained by lyrical pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned sun and linked hands reconfigure meaning with undeniable emotional cost felt in the squeeze. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (shadow, breath, hair relic) deepens stake density until the hush itself becomes the decisive reweighting. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causal breaks. The eclipse coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing—tapestry dragons pulse, hinting stories might rekindle dreams—visible on the final line. Causal chain is thin: reading Miriam’s diary does not alter Elias’s tactics; it merely confirms his hunch. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases but never tightens options, so pressure stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias seals the official letter unread, cementing his refusal to re-enter espionage; the image of cooking the paper into paste literalizes the cost of forever closing that door. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard adds density until the final crystallizing gesture reweights the stakes. The two-strand structure (lighthouse present + mainland reverberations) is legible with a single white-space transition, satisfying Track B rules.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: looping chant, tightening time, and the shrinking palette reweight the stake toward a single-color confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise––Matthias crossing the threshold with the crimson wound-image––but the absence of an actual interrogation scene keeps the cost conceptual rather than dramatized, blunting the decisive snap required for 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortune’s sentence reweights the premise that unheard music is already real, and the glass spire dissolving into dawn images the cost of Elira’s disappearance. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the mirrored horizon pattern is taught early and returns to split at the climax, satisfying the lens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. The only causal gap: the council’s deadline (“before exhaustion hits”) is declared but never manifests as an on-page symptom that forces a final micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last image reweights the premise—she claims authorship of the ripple. Causality under the Accumulative lens coheres; each shard adds density until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught early (viaduct, tablet, suspended moment) and pays off. Persistent constraint (fractured selves) shapes every beat; cost is felt in the darkening brightness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken needle/filament of hush crystallise into a new sensory grammar, cost is felt (“she would never hear the way she once had”). Causal chain intact: deafness → seek Koren → backward phonograph → somatic enthrall → re-steering life. Orientation anchored by 120 words, single scene, one transition-free arc; speculative backward-sound rule taught early and paid off. No causal or continuity breaks; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: because her data threaten the ministry, therefore she is followed → she escapes laterally → she chooses to act. The moment she rolls the parchment into the tube is a visible Decisive Change with felt cost (the courtyard calm she is about to lose). One hairline scaffold: “progress laterally” is repeated verbatim from prompt; does not break causality but keeps it shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty vial + glowing bloom reweight the premise—grief is love’s persistent molecular trace—with unmistakable conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-turn driven; each sensory beat thickens the pattern until the ultraviolet reveal crystallizes meaning. One transition (past reflection on brother) is cleanly cued by the vial scent, keeping the lens stable. Orientation is secured within 120 words via “lantern broker,” “Conservatory,” “ultraviolet rays.”

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the restarted spiral makes the refusal legible and the rope’s new luminescence carries felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each spiral layer deepens the stake rather than causing a new external event. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. The only drag is a 40-word reflective block that recaps prison back-story already implied; it slightly dilutes the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chronic hush is not defeated yet the reader feels a re-tuned breath between final note and silence; bowl’s warmth from sun+music is visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—bowl vibrates therefore she knows something answered; she walks out carrying its weight. No set-up breaks, orientation clear by 60 words; lens held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal chain: design → self-test → grief-subsumption → renunciation. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes the illusion of whole truths and accepts perpetual half-lie craft; cost is the fresh grief now resident in her body. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“amber grotto at dusk”). Lens holds: causal linkage narrows options to “work is never finished, only suspended.”

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the envelope mis-delivery tightens pattern until the midnight gift reweights “invisible labor.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren’s private ritual expands—cost is felt in the annotated program she accepts. One scaffold: “walking home…already planning” states the change already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern—spiral tag, crystalline orchard, glass-powder echoes—and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Threader is not a person but the practice of marking where newcomers learn to weave themselves in. Cost is legible in the final image: Yara must now ask, not offer, and the new spirals ahead promise ongoing vulnerability. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (crater rim, crystalline orchard, reeds in satchel). Causality is lyric but coherent: each mirrored surface intensifies the central stake until the arbor reconfigures it. No lens ambiguity; the final spiral reweights the premise under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: vanishing cadence → grandmother’s clue → pendant-enabled breach → restored echoes; the stolen moments visibly cost the giant’s dream (time borrowed → cadence freed), landing a clean Earned Stasis with conceptual price. Orientation is swift and the single transition up-canal is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of looking, counting, fitting fragments intensifies toward the final “dovetailed with it.” Orientation is complete by line 3; transitions not required in single-scene design. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—eyes left as offering reweight ambiguous loss into lived pattern; cost is legible in “she rose, her knees aching.” Persistent constraint (loss unnamed) shapes every beat; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (sapphire hush, pipe whispers, tape fragment) deepens the dominant stake—unseen custodianship—until the mother’s voice reweights Maren’s vocation as transmission. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she exists not to be seen but to help the lost find their way” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Pattern taught early (“unseen work matters”) pays off without causality breaks. Orientation anchored by word 70; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly in Earned Stasis: she does not sell, yet the cost—admission of fear to Sarah—rings on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-damaged vines refigure meaning without causal reversals. The linden leaf motif is seeded early, re-priced in the final image. No orientation debt; timeline and geography stay crisp inside greenhouse/trellis perimeter.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each water-detail layers desperation until the telescope moment reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira’s first sleep in nineteen nights—earned by the brooch-for-vision trade; the cost is the literal warmth she gives up. Orientation is clean by line 8; transitions across the causeway are legible. One minor slack: the stranger’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s music reweights Varen’s premise that the future is a possessed territory; the final image of him “still a clairvoyant, but something more” carries undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sound, shadow, and pearl reconfigure meaning rather than causal chain; pattern is taught early and held. One tight scaffold phrase (“the way one notices breathing…”) is forgivable at this length and does not touch the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the valve’s re-weighted meaning (“promise that the sound would come again”) reconfigures the harbor from absence to potential signal, with conceptual cost—he must now become the voice he preserved. The accumulative lens holds: fragments → vision → cumulative promise; no causal missteps. Orientation is anchored at word 24 (“ivory harbor after rain”), well inside the 120-word window. One tightening beat suffices; the story deepens rather than reverses.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivory stones glistening after rain, salt crystals on notebook leather, and the corroded brass valve create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the archivist’s grip and final decision. Sensory selection stays inside his professional gaze—cataloguing wreckage, not sightseeing. Spatial choreography is clean: edge-of-harbor → among exiles → stone archive → window. Weather residue affects footing and mood, integrating into the closing image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine of mentor-dare → arrow-cracks → fortress → self-punch holds without gaps; each micro-choice narrows the path to the station. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the unspoken truth is perforated into public air, foreclosing her former silence with visible shimmer-cost. The drive lens is Causal, intact to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tile reweights her scientific rule-set, undeniable cost in “taking and giving in equal measure.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copied symbol layers density until the final dawn image crystallizes the new stance. Orientation is anchored by line 9; no ambiguity at closure. One transition (night→dawn) is legible and coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: “some goodbyes were merely hellos…” reweights immortality itself under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the visible shredding of the escondite he must now inhabit. Orientation is taught early via prismatic fracturing and the amulet cue; no penalty applied. Causality holds: three-millennia wait → storm pulse → spatial mutiny → lifted fragment → revealed translation. One tight deepening suffices for this length; no reversals are required.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s new “equation” is legible in the gesture of placing white chrysanthemums beside the ink pot—an image that reweights both objects and forecloses her prior detachment. Causal chain holds: rejected asylum → night-shroom breach → ink epiphany → rewritten application → approval, each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when) and never wavers. Cost is unmistakable: she risks job and reputation the instant she lets a live fugitive into the dead’s domain. The lens stays causal throughout; no cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the prism-scatter seeds the final image with conceptual cost—the town may never speak, her labor may be endless. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of refracted light and layered silence deepens until the last line reweights the stake. Causality is loose—no concrete obstacle or choice tightens the middle—but the ending reconfigures meaning under the taught pattern, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s preservation reweights the death-certificate erasure, proving survival without official sanction. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fragment-gathering tightens into meaning at the end. Orientation is taught early via the container maze and tide rhythm; no penalty applied. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric-accumulative mode; the label’s discovery feels fated by tide rather than coincidence, satisfying the lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the softened paper tucked among years of fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each hum thickens the density of regret until the pattern breaks with her forfeiture of explanatory certainty. Orientation is clean by ~80 words; the single transition (threshold → dome interior) is legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the compass of human connection pointed…inward” reweights the central stake without tidy resolution. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the epistemic method that once defined her.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s chalking widens from lone act to insurgent lattice, crystallizing community stance with felt future cost (privatized canals). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—symbols layer until pattern reweights meaning; no causal reversals needed. Orientation complete by 60 words; spatial anchors stable. Cost legible in last line: “ready” implies tomorrow’s confrontation she may lose. Minor slack: no concrete sabotage choice yet, so just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the chemical image slowly developing inside the camera reweights her witness into permanent loss. The causality chain—earthlight triggers sublimation, clock forces one exposure, film will outlast frost—lands with conceptual cost on the page. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s restored flight crystallizes “connection” with visible cost (the mist swallowing it). Causal chain holds: water method → diagnosis → patch → release, all under tightening clock. No orientation debt; depot/ship/dawn anchors land by line 6. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of refraction images intensifies until the final cadence shift—and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the leaf + symbol reweight her map and confirm the convergence, cost felt in the “long uncertainty” now ending. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterns of condensation, archival marginalia, falcon return—tightening into a single crystallizing image. No orientation debt; geography and timeline clear by ~100 words. One scaffold loop: “the way moisture gathered differently…” appears twice with no new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the archway’s hum is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the town from mute to sounding, with the cost of 5 000+ aching steps still in Eliorn’s body. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“seven thousand repetitions”) and held to the final cadence; each circuit thickens density rather than causal turns. No orientation debt; stakes and lens are legible by 120 words. The quiet payoff is earned, specific, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens: “because” chain (vial → scent → memory → mechanism → vessel) lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her individual death transmuted into collective afterlife. Orientation is swift: diver, temple, oxygen clock all inside 120 words. The oxygen countdown evaporates once perfume replaces air, but the story teaches this rule change before closure, so no cap triggered. Closure cost is visible: “she would live… not as herself but as something greater.”

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus speaks the withheld words and the lighthouse keeper hears, reconfiguring prisoner/keeper roles with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of layered images (copperlight, lattice, scuffs) tightens to final resonance—though the bodies-on-reef stakes are declared, not tested, keeping the cost slightly speculative.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each ghost-touch thickens pattern until silver sap and tears reweight meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—the instant gardener’s tear acknowledges inherited curse/ gift; cost is legible (“loving venom enter her bloodstream”). Orientation crystal by ¶3; no lens break; causal chain intact; persistent constraint (debt) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared in the first paragraph—“centuries of silence,” “overlapping corridors,” “ghosts of precedent”—and held to the last line where the stitched luminescence reweights the whole maze into reverence. The copper plate is seeded early, returned at climax, and its conceptual cost (the broken tradition now made whole) is unmistakable in the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 80 with “red canyon walls,” “empty tide pools,” and the sleepwalking mechanics taught immediately. Closure is a Charged Poise: the luminous path is not walked here, but its existence reconfigures every prior night’s exile into purposeful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dig reveals artifacts that thicken ancestral texture; the sundial’s birthmark match supplies a charged pattern-break. Closure is a Charged Poise—sundial re-set under the apple tree—re-weighting her exile/home axis with undeniable conceptual cost: she becomes the orchard’s next keeper. Orientation anchors within 60 words; the lens is taught early and held. One soft spot: the pandemic delay is told in summary, not activated as present obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed letter with the postscript “Vesper Lane is who you were…” reweights identity for both Eleanor and Maren, foreclosing anonymity at a felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (ritual layering of names, codes, dawn light) and tightens into the final image of Maren stepping into the arcade morning. No orientation drift; stakes escalate through density shift rather than causal turns, satisfying the short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new thread crystallizes her stance to carry stories forward, cost legible in “echoed silence” and frost already forming; lens holds Accumulative with pattern taught early and deepening cadence at end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “I forgive you” reweights the unsent letter and lets Maren occupy both selves—clear, felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is memory-driven, but each return of the shard/condensation tightens the emotional stake without contradiction. Orientation is swift; no prop or knowledge teleporting. One hairline slip: the window’s first message is slightly late (~140 w), just past the 120 w waiver, but it pays off at closure so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira presses her palm to the cast one last time, accepting the ache as the only homeland left. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each linguistic fragment layers density until the final touch reweights the stake from “understand” to “carry.” Causality is lyric but legible: the Wolof smudges exist → Elira translates → the grandmother weeps → Elira forfeits the cast, her private archive. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 60 and the misty atrium remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dancer’s light fades, the fragment darkens, yet the children carry the rhythm—an earned stasis with visible cost (the spent fresco). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each layered projection intensifies texture until joy re-enters communal memory; no false reversals, no convenient luck. Orientation is swift—fog, stumps, wall—within 60 words; the single-scene default holds. One minor loop: “the way… the way…” in adjacent sentences could compress, but it never obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s acoustical rule-set is repriced—restoration becomes co-authorship—and the cost is felt in her relinquished certainty; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first echo to final brush-lift without lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s invisible root becomes the first untaxable thought, reweighting the entire cognitive-currency premise. Causal chain holds—receives seed → deciphers spiral → plants at convergence → drone passes → seed stirs—each step narrows options and makes the final image inevitable. Cost is legible in the single line “the responsibility of being the charming rogue scholar…all for the privilege of planting defiance,” tying prior risk to present irrevocable act.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the accelerating writing and trembling postcard reconfigure the wait into active offer, cost felt in the “sustained dark.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of lullaby dispersal and spiral imagery tightens toward the final bloom—without causal reversals. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet serves the final image, so no penalty. All beats grow from prior particulars; no teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked chime is restored to its altar, the library’s pulse acknowledging that the work is endless. The cost is conceptual—eternal servitude in foxglove regret—but felt only in abstract, not through a beat that narrows her options. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern deepens rather than pivots. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no causal breaks, but no decisive change either.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the manuscript is decoded, silence breaks, and mutual tears price the reunion. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of language imagery builds to cadence shift rather than causal dominoes—and the pattern holds. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty applied. One structural soft-spot: the eleven-year stake is asserted, not evidenced in-scene, so the time-scale cost is more abstract than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: each sensory fragment (heat pulse, chain weight, adhesive spectrum) layers density until the final “link by measured link” crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation anchored by word 42 (“crumbling amphitheater’s center”) and never loosens; volcano breath and tool handling teach the pattern early. Closure lands cleanly: she forecloses the option to flee, accepts perpetual stewardship; cost is felt in the exhalation of “dappled resolve.” No causality gaps; even off-stage father is filtered through her spectroscope, never teleported.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the last image reweights the entire inheritance—she accepts perpetual openness to silence as the price of continuation. Causal lattice holds: each attic session (“mapping dust motes”) tightens the possibility of full recovery until the final playback crystallizes that trust is practice, not outcome. Orientation anchored by word 66 (“the attic of Morrow & Daughter Books”). Cost is felt in the final sentence—“the willingness to send another message into the silence”—a visible forfeiture of closure that is the only way to keep the chain alive.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: butterfly effect → loss of intuition → logbook cue → grain-reading → terrace drift → crossing. Each beat tightens options; the final step collapses distance with earned inevitability. Closure is a Charged Poise image—mother with compass—reweighting every prior threshold. Cost is palpable: the old atmospheric intuition is gone, payment for the new map.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ancestral return → luminous encounter → communal reprise builds density until the closing image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 3; closure lands as Charged Poise—the dome fills with firefly constellations and Marek’s solitude is conceptually repriced into shared witness, cost felt in the imminent flood. One shard, single POV, no teleporting props; archive note and feather resonance bracket the tightening effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the crater glass and geode refract emotional residue into denser, shifting patterns until the final image reweights the fisher’s loss into continuation rather than erasure. Orientation is swift; causal linkage is loose but coherent—each seed adds texture until the gap itself becomes the resonant absence. Closure is a Charged Poise: “some paths don’t disappear… they just lead somewhere unexpected,” crystallizing options with undeniable emotional cost visible in the fisher’s tears. No meaningful constraint or price boomerangs back onto Maren, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop pocketed, the tide still pulsing, tomorrow’s calculation already begun—cost is the knowledge that wonder is manufactured. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each preparatory micro-gesture layers density until the crowd’s smile reconfigures the night’s meaning. One scaffold loop (“each journey different yet somehow the same”) dulls the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tide-images and garden hush tightens toward the ink-transfer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—anchor dissolves, exile becomes arrival—cost legible in “lighter than the dust.” Orientation clear by line 4; no causal break. One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last ripple reaches the bank and disappears, reweighting the premise that “one becomes the other.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence, not causal chain—and the final image carries conceptual cost: the ordinary world “reasserts itself” while she carries the pond’s lesson. The piece meets the 9+ quick test for closure with cost under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the ridge thickens the pattern of scars, saplings, moonlight, and porcelain until the closing breath reweights the bargain. Orientation is anchored by 70 words; the single shard-scene obeys scope. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mira’s seated vigil crystallizes the cost of traded innocence and forecloses self-pardon. Cost is legible in the cracked mirror pressed to lips, a persistent constraint she will carry back to the station.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—she resolves to keep experimenting—but the cost is only opportunity/time, not foreclosed option, so resonance stays mild. Causality is loop-like: each balloon launch is an iterative “and-then” rather than a because/therefore escalation; no failed launch alters her next fold or angle. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught late and never breaks pattern, so tightening is more cadence than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensuous layer (ivy breath, ink ghost, negative emulsion) tightens the stake of remembering until the unfinished echo-chart passes from Ashworth to Mira with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the walls “begin to dream aloud,” reconfiguring her isolation into continuity; the cost is the unending, unshared labor she now accepts. Causality remains intact: every beat of discovery follows because the fire died too soon and because Mira chose to keep listening.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Aria descends the steps as the first bell tolls, the mirrors left awakened and irreversible, the cost the ungraspable futures she will never witness. Causality is lyric but tight—each mirror ripples because her coded lullabies physically vibrate their surfaces, a rule taught early and paid off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within 60 words: terrace at dawn, spring rain, abandoned villa. No teleporting props; the prism parapet’s droplets refract the light that seeds the visions, tying setting to causality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the handshake lingers, reweighting the forever-war stalemate under the Accumulative lens; the cost is felt in Maren’s realization that “the work would continue—messy, incomplete.” Causality holds: ritual reading → shared grief → handshake, each beat accumulating density rather than forcing reversal. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the clipboard’s tactile role in the final image could be sharper to nail the persistent-constraint test outright.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg alone on the salt flat reconfigures the entire moral universe with undeniable conceptual cost—she has engineered a sterile Eden to buy one fragile chance at song. Causal chain holds: drought → elimination of threats → release → self-exile. Time/place anchor (“the afternoon sun would warm its shell”) is precise at ~word 550, inside the 120-word window. No prop or knowledge teleports; the container is unpacked, the map is followed, the thunder lull is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the courtyard’s echo-threads accumulate until the dawn-light re-prisms them, re-weighting her stake from passive survival to luminous defiance. The closure is a Charged Poise—she walks away leaving “no mark,” yet the cost is legible: she can never again be sung asleep. Orientation is anchored inside 60 words; pattern taught early; final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stick left standing reweights the premise that “unwritten words” can possess ethical force; cost is legible in the abdication of narrative control. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of echoing hush/stick/light culminates in the final image without causal contradiction. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props or logic breaks. Just shy of 8.8 because the reverse-telling device is declared rather than demonstrated beat-by-beat, softening the decisive change punch.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragility (grotto, vine lattice, monarch, histories) intensifies until the final stillness reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; closure beat—“She would build them again tomorrow”—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost. One causality hairline: the monarch’s recognition of the moth-wing angle is poetic but not rigorously motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new hum is an audible, felt cost—she walks away aching, leaving her safety of silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each paragraph adds density to memory-objects until the final cadence shift reweights the stake from “frozen grief” to “carried remembrance.” Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sanctum’s doors,” “frost-laced floor”) and never wavers. No causality breaks; the punched card pattern is the taught constraint that shapes the braiding tactic and pays off in the glowing rope.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative lens holds: each sensory pulse, seal-glow, and ink-bleed thickens texture until the directive flips from command to answered questions—an effective CR with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; the closing transcend is more label than image, but the reweighting of “decaying directive” lands cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each archive shard adds density until the candle-grid pattern breaks into resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—palace still standing, stars “closer,” new rulers unaware—cost is the astronomer’s lifelong silence. Persistent constraint: he must never boast or break the covenant, a price that shapes the final smile. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pin reappears only after Kael admits spite, making forgiveness the price of restored music. Causal logic holds—cellular memory is seeded early, grace-conservation rules are repeatedly demonstrated—so the payoff feels inevitable. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by word 60. One minor causality wobble: “pin will reappear when needed” is stated after we already see it appear; still, the rule is taught before the final image, so the loop holds.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror shows “glass mountains” and reweights the premise, with fog-bound orchard as persistent constraint. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift replace because/therefore—yet the sextant’s prior emotional stake is only told, not tested, so the cost is more conceptual than felt; still, lens holds and image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the re-tied ribbon is a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible and carries felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each seasonal image and rotting pear adds density until the final release. The Orientation Test is passed: ivy-curtained doors, shattered glass, and orchard in rafters anchor us by 120 words. One minor loop—“she had… she had… she had”—slows the climb but does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cameo’s image crystallizes, reweighting the premise—Mira now “understands,” inheritance complete, path foreclosed. Causality holds: because she asks the prescribed question, the blank yields its image; the persistent constraint (nonlinear, unbreakable legacy) shapes every tactic. Orientation is clear by word 96; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible on the final line: she is “no longer bewildered,” a cognitive and emotional forfeiture paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is present—a Resonant Reconfiguration—yet the cost is conceptual, not dramatized; we’re told she “understood” but not shown a forfeiture. The causal chain is loose: the council “summoned” her, the traveler “broke” entry terms, and she will “renegotiate,” but no beat depicts her actually altering terms or surrendering anything. Orientation wavers: the mountain’s geography keeps shape-shifting, a clever effect that never constrains her path. Final image satisfies lyrically yet lacks tangible consequence, capping credibility of change.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, card, and voice accrete until the final Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by 62 words, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“both trapped… and impossibly free”—with conceptual cost legible. However, the escalation is only one soft tightening; no option is foreclosed, so the beat never deepens beyond mood shift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: seal → braid cipher → door materializes, each because/therefore legible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena’s stance toward the university as “living document” is re-priced with conceptual cost—though the moment is compressed into a single sentence, slightly muting the felt punch.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (cracks, ice, stone pulse) thickens until the null-point silence lands as Conceptual Repricing—cost is the lifelong map-skill spent/emptied into the void. Spatial anchors and chronology are legible by line 6; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tower ascent crystallizes options and the pavilion’s approving hum reweights meaning with conceptual cost—she commits to becoming the living bridge. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prism discovery → memory cascade → decision to climb. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty. One scaffold loop—“she felt… she understood… she realized”—slows the final paragraph, but causality survives.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: she inhabits identity as performance, cost felt in the hush after storm. Accumulative lens holds—density of image, not causal chain—yet the ending still reweights the premise. Shadow-reading is taught early and returns in final image, satisfying pattern. Orientation clear by 70 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: vanished stars → heavier world → Mira walks → mosaic dare → she burns the rag. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is locked by word 80. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: one irreplaceable rag gone, sky still blank, but human response triggered; the “gravity of hopelessness” is physically contested. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; even the mosaic note is discovered, not delivered. A 9.0 would need the cost to boomerang back onto Mira’s body or future options on this same page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal returns, jade warmth, and star-wheel re-weights the silence until the cicada placement crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure lands—“the tide was turning”—with conceptual cost: the sisters accept an unfinished ebb rather than synthetic reconciliation. Orientation clean by line 8; no prop drift. Minor ripple: three-year gap is told not dramatized, but it doesn’t rupture causality because the present texture carries the emotional debt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hour ends, gravity reasserts, Mira chooses to carry the gilded hush back inside the bunker—an on-page renunciation with felt cost (“solidarity that felt like promise rather than constraint”). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence she samples adds density until the sprout/doll image crystallizes her new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“father’s bunker”). No meaningful lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass’s perfect clarity is the visible reweighting—silence has been taught to comfort, the boy breathes evenly, and Maren’s earlier “fluidly logical” tactics are forever altered. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each refracted spectrum, vapor wisp, and harmonic note layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is undeniable: the extra minutes spent, the vapor released, the operator’s intimate intrusion into a stranger’s psyche—all persist after the echo fades.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: star-window → orchard → peel murals → throne/stair reveal → ascent, each because/therefore hinge tightening her future. Closure gives Decisive Change with cost: she forfeits mortal scholar life to become trans-dimensional custodian—“the bridge” duty materialises in crystalline spirals. One soft spot: the pavilion peel is the sole trial; no prior obstacle tests her, so escalation is thin until that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the decisive act of stepping through the threshold reconfigures her options and is charged by the fading boundary and cold ring—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each image (ash, clasped hands, gasping double) tightens the density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; who/where/when is anchored within 60 words. One minor loop—“sanctuary…sanctuary”—does not touch the final beat, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: scam trauma → text lure → bolt retrieval → farm arrival → quantum payoff. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s re-weighting from kitsch relic to crystallized belief is legible, and the “lighter” final line shows felt cost. Orientation is clean by 120 wds; lens stays causal throughout. Non-closure nit: the other Maya is introduced late yet given climactic exposition without prior seed, a minor teleport that keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is lean and coherent: arrival → discovery → turn → ancestral voice. Closure is a conceptual re-pricing: bloodline “accident” becomes unavoidable inheritance. The cut-off ending prevents a full Decisive Change on the page, so the cost is heard but not yet paid in action, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative lens is taught early (star-fruit, frozen poses) and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: when the last string snaps the greenhouse—and the knight’s three-year stasis—dissolves, leaving him bearing “weight and worth beyond any earthly kingdom.” Cost is unmistakable in the vanishing orchard and the unsnapped marionette; causality stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the act of writing reweights her role and the button’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality intact—button triggers reflection which triggers documentation; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint (cannot decide fate) shapes final action. Cost legible in final sentence; lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s descent into the ancestral archive reweights her former invisibility into visible insurgency, cost made legible by the sirens still sweeping overhead. Causal chain holds: audit exposure → map-read in puddle → key turns → shaft opens → original histories found, each beat tightening options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) settle within first 60 words; no debt. The inferred lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sonic ritual tightens once when the first code-fragment breaks through and is shattered.  Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush is renewed, the cost is his ragged breath merging with fog.  Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no因果 breaks; prophecy logic stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands: finding the forgotten seed is a Decisive Change that reweights the drought prophecy with survival hope. Causal chain—leaf → message → vault → seed—remains tight; the moonstone speck’s glow is the earned trigger. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Cost is present (she will “be a different woman”), but the price feels speculative (“by morning”) rather than tangibly paid on-page, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is classic single-scene descent: letter → greenhouse → stairwell; causality is sequential, not tightening. Stakes declared (compass, Elias) but no reversal or cost paid in these 266 words; ending is pure threshold. Closure therefore “Charged Poise” at best—valid but fragile. Orientation clean, transitions clean; escalation missing keeps it shy of 8.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds without slack: coin’s pulse → kintsugi decision → golden seams awaken → recognition of shared vocation → Maren re-enters world transformed. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored coin visibly gleams, cost is the irreversible acknowledgment that safety is cowardice. Orientation anchors (foundry, post-funeral, night rain) arrive by line 4. No lens ambiguity; the “because/therefore” drive stays intact to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the soldier’s dispersal in “something that looked almost like gratitude” reconfigures Mira’s endless task, cost felt in her unhealed ache. Causal chain intact—croc-tooth tuning → broken chord → laughter → release—each step contingent on the last. Orientation is clean by line 10. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each sensory and memory layer thickens rather than triggers. The beat sequence (forest walk → clearing threshold) deepens knowledge and stakes; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the mask-strap as shackle/key. Orientation clean within 120 words; anaphoric repetitions (“the mathematics…”) teach rhythm; cost is felt in final ultraviolet glare.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lens reframes the protagonist from keeper to conduit, cost legible in the “beam of pure intuition aimed at nothing and everything.” Accumulative lens holds: seventeen years of forgetting tighten into one charged image. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; transition from stall to painting rotation is the single taught pivot that deepens pattern rather than breaks it.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each inspection beat (dust, cracks, brass find) tightens options toward the hatch reveal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4; deliberate early disorientation not attempted, so no penalty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s decision to engage accepts the “weightless burden” with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Persistent constraint—his gift/curse—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frost-to-bottle-to-press sequence forms a clean causal spine: pattern read → object found → rupture executed → new page composed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Library’s rule-set literally rewrites itself in cloud-syntax, visible cost paid in the shattering frost and the emptied bottle. Orientation is swift—glass orchard, floating floor, cloud-sea all named by line 6—so no penalty applies. One minor slack: the “section that had not existed before” appears without foreshadowing, a soft teleport rather than earned rupture, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses the “single-story” future, choosing custodianship of multiplicity; cost is the solitude of bearing fragments without being cut. Causal chain holds—shard blood → mirror protocol → vision of fleeing founders → reframing of truth. Orientation anchored by line 9; storm arrival is the because/therefore hinge. Minor slip: “governing council” laugh-off is off-page summary; could tighten causality if shown.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands: the orchestrion sounds again—clear Decisive Change with felt cost (decades of work crystallize into one note). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of gathering light/melody intensifies toward cadence shift. Orientation is late—who, where, when appear ~130 words in; waiver fails because delayed anchors do not pay off at closure, so −0.3 applied. Causality is interior-textural rather than because/therefore plot, acceptable under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she refuses to capture the lagoon’s scent, foreclosing her lifelong profession with visible cost—the empty vial lowered but not filled. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each smelled relic layers urgency until the pattern breaks at the lagoon, reweighting the stake from acquisition to surrender. Causality is intact; the compass psychometry triggers descent, factory closure enables access, and no off-stage shortcuts appear. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “She would not return.”

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural pattern is taught by word 50 and lands a charged poise: the slide layers historical images until Aria’s stance reconfigures. Each shard (GPS death → arch shelter → slide vision → studio renunciation) tightens the same stake—how to make meaning from wreckage. Closure beat—“each motion a prayer”—makes the conceptual cost undeniable; no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the postcards, frost tracings, and hidden glass layers thicken pattern until the cathedral-window map reweights the stake—beauty blooms unseen—delivering a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (her mural turns “true,” not decorative). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“amber pavilion”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. One minor causality gap: the lunar-cycle mechanics are inferred, not shown to alter any on-page tactic, but the closure beat itself is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The causal spine is clear—diary → lagoon → apparition → witness—but the decisive change is performed by the grandmother, not Miriam; the only cost is transferred memory. The apparition’s exposition retro-explains stakes instead of tightening Miriam’s choices. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (truth must be remembered), yet the price is prospective, not felt on the page now. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the final image reweights meaning, but the protagonist’s agency is passive, capping the score at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lanterns ignite without flame, civilization re-constellates from memory, and Elias walks forward into a world whose price is the centuries he spent alone—cost is legible in “for the first time in centuries.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each artisan memory layer thickens texture until the cove itself re-fabricates. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors land by line 3 and the pattern is taught early. Causality is interior but coherent—memory is the because/therefore engine.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the dead keep their word” reweights the foghorn’s silence with felt archival responsibility; the cost is the scribe’s acceptance of permanent listening. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—each sensory layer (wax, orchard, languages) densifies until meaning flips. No causality break; BRR at ~25% is interleaved with present micro-choices and cues, so no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the vortex seals around the seedling and Elara’s stance is permanently recalibrated—“serene wildness” is a textbook Charged Poise with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: entropy reversal is patterned early, density crests in the final image, and no causal links are broken. The oak cap’s cellular memory is the persistent constraint that shapes every beat; its reappearance in the last sentence reweights all prior meditation. Only the thinnest whisp of exposition (“she had studied these instructions…”) keeps this from a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: narrowing microclimate data thickens until the siren births the storm. Closure is a Charged Poise—the green cascade on the monitor reconfigures the stakes from private vigil to public alarm—yet the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt by Elara on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of stillness + star-tracing early and holds it to the final image. Closure is a Charged Poise—amber fragment lifted into recycling fires—reconfiguring stillness as generative, not terminal. Cost is felt in the janitor’s tender slowness and the star’s extinguished blaze; no orientation or causality flaws intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira’s silent acceptance of the covenant forecloses departure and is charged by the ghost’s fade and the box’s impossible weight. Accumulative lens holds—density of light, glass, silence tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“time is the space between breaths”—with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the lens. However, the beat is delivered in exposition, not dramatised action; causality between fragment-handling and insight is weak, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the poet walking home with “woven dawns inside like a small fire” reweights the rule-set—value now resides in incompletion itself, not flight. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each handling of feather/kite thickens the texture of incompleteness until the missing string is reframed as invitation. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early via rain-aftermath fragments and holds. Cost is unmistakable: the kite will never fly, the bird remains injured, the poet surrenders omnipotent repair. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. No loops or artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wind through copper-wrapped branches re-weights her impending death into continuity, cost felt in “she would not live to see the full flowering.” Accumulative lens holds—each copper coil and diary sketch layers density until the final cadence reconfigures meaning without a causal reversal. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity breaks the lens. One scaffold tic (“she had been slowly remodeling…”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band gate ajar.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amber fly re-weights the pilgrimage premise—“the journey itself constituted the destination.” Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) rather than dramatized, satisfying the lens. However, causality is thin: the tower visit does not test or change Elena’s options; she arrives, reflects, leaves. The dusty footprints function as texture, not constraint, so the final insight feels accumulated rather than forced by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “first green thread” rewrites the battlefield’s meaning and carries conceptual cost—the coachman’s life-work now complete. Causal chain holds: because he hears treaty-calls → plants memory-seeds → reef answers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“edge of the jetty”). One minor soft spot: the fertilisation spell succeeds without resistance or micro-failure, so tension plateaus rather than tightens in the final third; enough cost is felt to keep the lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mosaic structure (three time-shards) is taught by the 25 % mark and collapses cleanly into the tactile-reading climax; causality is accumulative-textural, not sequential, and the closure reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“distance is an illusion”). The missing-orientation risk is waived because disorientation is functional—confusion mirrors the narrator’s own hunt for legibility—so no penalty applies. One soft spot: the cylinder’s playing mechanism is introduced as already-built offstage, a mild teleporting-prop moment that blunts the full causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “true north was not a destination but a way of moving” reweights the whole premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through iterated silence/sketch beats until the final cadence shift. The persistent constraint of temporal exile shapes every tactical move, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Seraph’s recognition that the pieces were “stolen decades ago” reweights Caelius’s debt and lifts his burden with conceptual cost. Causal chain is clear—steal → guilt → hunt → gift → exposure—and holds under a single-scene window. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secure by line 5; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the spelled word “beginning” reconfigures the archive into forward motion; the cost is the sister’s name dissolving into the dome. Accumulative lens holds—each whispered footstep adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean by line 5; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s permission-vocabulary reweights her stance toward her gift; cost is felt in the pain of sudden memory. Causal linkage holds: buried talent → seven nights refusal → seed-question → permission → decision to exit. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at the glowing stone tightens the stake without fracture. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric-accumulative lens holds: each frozen tableau adds density until the tapestry decoding act breaks the pattern and reweights Mira’s guilt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her story literally re-woven, the village restarting—visible in the first raindrop and the resumed motion of the child. Orientation is immediate; no因果链 breaks. Cost is felt: she forfeits the self-loathing that had kept her in exile. The ending would hit 9+ if the price were sharpened by an external witness or irrevocable act rather than internal quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon now saturated with refracted truths the priests cannot unspeak, Sera’s cost legible in the irreversible dispersal of her silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each poem layers density until the ritual’s vacuum collapses. Causality is clean: because she writes and speaks, the ritual is neutered. Small Orientation waiver: “the pale spire… rose” opens with poetic disorientation, but the payoff at closure justifies the mist-delayed anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the workshop’s “death” reframes into rebirth via her acceptance of uncertainty, legible in the acid sea’s retreat and her continued work. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each scar-matched memory tightens the stake until the final breath reweights everything. Orientation is swift—pressure seals, acid sea, three breaths—and the pattern holds. Cost is unmistakable: she forecloses certainty itself, tasted in blood and tears on the charm.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: three years’ stasis, cave wandering, and the emergent pool reweight the stake of “why paint” until the shell release crystallizes the shift. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causal chain is required under this lens, only a density shift that lands with cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of water holding hidden light reconfigures meaning and forecloses repossession of art as ownership. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page; a single sentence of bodily register at the release would clinch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the logbook line “The whispers were right” reweights the entire premise, making the lighthouse’s song a new rule-set with undeniable social cost for every sailor who will now expect darkness to answer. Causal lens holds: jasmine drop → purified intent → beacon reframed → ship turns; the 30-year blank page is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics and image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptor layer (dead beacon, moonlit marsh, bronze weight) tightens the emotional map until the final partnered stance reweights “navigation” as mutual bearing. Closure is Charged Poise—the two women poised at the tree-line, grief geography now shared—with felt cost implicit in Mara’s continuing vigil. Orientation anchors clear by 80 words; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass eye beside hidden texts crystallizes her outlawed mission with felt social cost. Causal chain holds—storm wreckage → climb → cache → resolve to study—but the “because” linking the glass eye to next action is implicit, not enacted. Orientation is quick; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the Edelweiss re-weights Aldric’s entire life, turning the lighthouse from sentinel of abandonment into “gathering place for lost things.” Causal chain (stranger → hidden note → recovered memory → decision) is tight; each beat narrows his interpretive options until writing feels inevitable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 80 words; Lighthouse Test passed. Cost is legible in the final clause—“follow the trail…close the gap”—which admits the emotional price of reopening sealed loss.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final step reweights every map she ever touched and is paid for by rising water that forecloses retreat. Accumulative lens holds: each artifact (atlases, ants, chip, flowers) layers density until the doorway crystallizes choice. Causality is implicit—chip warmth + rising creek = now-or-never—without forced exposition. One micro-turn suffices at this length and is cleanly delivered.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>The limestone cavern breathes through pale flowers that shouldn’t exist; the setting is filtered by Maren’s trained eye for impossible geographies. Spatial choreography is tight—ants form a “precise black line,” water touches ankles last—tracking bodies and props without drift. Environment constrains the final choice: only the crack beneath the door offers escape as the creek claims the floor. Micro-setting success: the matrix chip against her sternum functions as mobile “place” that heats when home nears.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen’s purpose is reborn under a sky that still bleeds, so the cost is the eternal stewardship she now carries. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric repetitions of “bleeding starlight” tighten the pattern until the final image reweights her sovereignty. However, the story exceeds the 800-word ceiling (~890), a technical disqualification at this venue.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: “the shell doesn’t hold the secret. We do.” The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—density of returns tightens the stake; the only drag is a 135-word delay before spatial anchor is fully nailed, but twilight/ember nexus cue arrives early enough to waive Orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scroll’s saturation with ink mirrors the narrator’s own irreversible saturation by time-sickness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the grave mutates from terminus to waystation, reweighting mortality itself. This reconfiguration is paid for by the visible cost of surrender to dreaming (“I will let the feral nostalgia take me”). Pattern was taught early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elena re-weights “sensing” from scent to attentive care; the warm screw is felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fog → light, scent → attention, birth → time. One smooth shard, orientation within 120 words, no causality breaks; tightening beat is the screw reveal that re-configures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the runes hold, her body stops turning grief to crystal, and the held breath exhales into self-belief. Causal lens holds throughout: failed inscription → recalling superstition → honest wound-ink → successful rune. The “breath between storms” is taught early and pays off in the final image. Cost is legible in the rain washing diamond-tears away, foreclosing her old scholarly detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: perfume cue → archive descent → flickering contact → apology → timed cutoff; the “imperfect miracle” current is externally supplied but accepted as premise, and the final “sharp, clean break” image pays the cost under a Resonant Reconfiguration lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Beautiful texture accumulates, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands—closure is absent. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases but never reweights options with a felt cost; the helix remains a static light show. Orientation is clear early, but the final paragraph simply halts the description rather than crystallizing meaning. The piece is an exquisite fragment, not a finished arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the horizon line and water-level coincide, re-weighting her vocation with quiet cosmic confirmation. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern builds through ritual repetition until the atmosphere aligns; no decisive turn narrows options, but the final image crystallizes meaning with felt cost (“content to tend…seventeen years more” = lifelong surrender). Orientation is swift; the lens holds, though the midnight whistle is the only temporal anchor before 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each pulse of bioluminescence thickens the pattern of unspoken nearness until the final breath brightens the network into visibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira’s realization that separation itself has been their love language—charged by the laser pointer’s seven-year weight and the man’s cracked vowel. Orientation is taught early (“the hush before the echo”) and anchors hold; no因果 break. Cost is unmistakable: the word “leaving” severs the cultivated silence that had defined them.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands: the lantern reweights “honest light” into mutual recognition. Causal chain is loose—subway scrawls are never shown to alter her actual route or tactics—so the turn hinges on accumulation of motif rather than because/therefore linkage; lens = Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, one transition (library→hospital), coherent shard pair.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ringing phone adds density to the pattern of anonymous confessions, tightening the emotional load until the final “phone rang” crystallizes Mira’s perpetual threshold stance. Orientation is nailed by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure is Charged Poise—the harmonica’s suspended note and the unanswered ring reweight her vocation as endless vigil—cost is the lifetime of absorbed grief she can never release. One soft spot: no micro-turn inside the scene; pressure accrues but never pivots her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: new promise reweights preservation covenant with future-risk cost felt in “bridge between what had been and what might yet be.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of steeping/tea/darkening photo culminates in resonant reconfiguration. No causality break; orientation anchored by word 80. Would reach 9+ if a concrete forfeiture (time, tool, chance) were forfeited on page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: rumor → platform → trade rule → midnight vigil. Closure is Earned Stasis: the logistician’s forfeiture of flight is legible, irreversible, paid on-page (“the sound echoed… like a promise kept”). Orientation is clean by 120 words, lens stays situational/ causal hybrid, no prop or logic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ascending/descending notes tightens the emotional map until the forest’s hush delivers a Charged Poise—Elara’s tearful stand at the stillpoint reweights all prior sensation and forecloses further seeking with undeniable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bent signal is revealed as a response, re-weighting exile as filtration, not failure. Cost is felt in the earlier career derailment and the ongoing isolation; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-break of the folded echo reframes her exile into purpose. Causality holds: the anomaly filters, her method listens, recognition arrives. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the camera remains unfilled yet now holds memory’s weight, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: pattern of unsigned stories → moonlit signing → shared silence set to music. One soft spot: the whispering advisor vanishes without beat-marking, a minor teleport, but it does not rupture causality. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; tightening deepens once when Marina chooses to sign spontaneously, foreclosing her prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Mira stays to preserve rather than burn—paid off on the final image of emerging with documented truths, a conceptual cost legible under the Accumulative lens. Orientation who/where is delayed ~180 words but the disorientation is later functional (lost city), so the penalty is waived. Causality between tapestry fragment → portrait → hidden cache is tight; the “three-year” ellipsis is told, not shown, softening the final weight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge of living color reconfigures meaning without curing her, and the drumming choice bears visible energetic price (“the garden answered…cascaded upward”). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of sensory ripples builds to final auric convergence; no causal ambiguity at end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by ~100 words; no waiver needed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard adds density until the final “whispers worked” crystallizes a reweighted social order. Orientation anchored by 80 words; transition at the silent radio hand-off is clean. Closure is Charged Poise: Reyes concedes, Mira descends again, coin warm—cost is the perpetual labor she embraces. No artifact obscures causality; every beat is a because/therefore of attention and trust.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror’s last star-gift reconfigures both their stances—he sees, she endures—cost is the unbreakable silence she accepts. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of woven light tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchor—“cobalt dock after rain”—arrives by line 3. No teleporting props; mirror is introduced with sister’s medical bag cue. Cost is unmistakable: “she had survived because someone had taught her to see the stars” now loops back as price she pays forward.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: montage of window displays, teacups, letters creates density that reweights the town’s certainty. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a forest of new possibilities” crystallized in the final sentence—conceptual cost legible. However, the piece is 90 % exposition; causal linkage is asserted (“When parents asked… Eleanor simply smiled”) rather than shown. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the absence of a pivotal beat where Eleanor could lose keeps the tightening abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scrimshaw left on the dock reweights the premise—freedom costs the very key that promised it. Causal chain holds: whale-call → invitation perceived → talisman set down → body enters water, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“harbor’s sublittoral fringe”) and spatial track stays clean across swim. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits heirloom, past identity, and dry world in one continuous motion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is clean: the Charged Poise beat—“I let my face remain perfectly, beautifully, defiantly blank”—reconfigures the mandate’s rule-set and carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because she narrates, the drones pass; because they pass, she can keep whittling; because she whittles, she arrives at the blank-faced stance that crystallizes her survival. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of turbine shadows, pine curls, and drone hums tighten until the final image reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: each column dissolves by lyrical accretion, culminating in Charged Poise as the atrium hum swells. Orientation is immediate; closure is legible—she leaves carrying the new poem. Yet the cost is ambient, not protagonist-wagered; no persistent constraint shapes later tactics, so the reconfiguration feels gift-like rather than paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed-tongue transfer crystallizes a before/after for both youths and reweights the courtyard as a site of awakenings. Causal chain holds: because Mira traded paintings for the reed, therefore she can now trade it again to awaken the apprentice; because he deciphers the leaf spiral, therefore he kneels—legible cost in the surrender of the object and the burn-calloused hand that accepts it. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of flawed glass + leaf arrangements grows until the final fusion image. Minor slack: “phoenix rose” frame is poetic but unfelt; no constraint or price flows from the cosmic event into the intimate beat, keeping closure local rather than world-touched.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph thickens the pattern of “manufactured yet authentic” until the final crystallization that “all journeys are artificial.” Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on-page; no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s invitation crystallizes a path where mourning and love co-bloom, cost visible in the pendant’s withered flower. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—starlight, curtains, origami accrete into a cadence shift that reweights grief itself. One soft scaffold: “centuries of practice” is told twice; otherwise rhythm is clean. The orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the measuring tape is rolled, rain branches overhead, and Soren’s hope is reconfigured against inherited mystery with undeniable conceptual cost. The branching card method supplies the required Decisive Change—paths multiply, foreclosing the fantasy that the crash can be reverse-engineered. Orientation is clean: loft, rain, grandmother deck established by line 4. Causal lens dominates; micro-turn is the twelve-foot pull that reweights options. One minor causality wobble: “she had known, of course” arrives without an on-page cue that triggered the knowledge, but it doesn’t rupture the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dance spirals density until the boundary dissolves, landing a Charged Poise with felt cost ("I would emerge changed"). Orientation is clear by word 80; causality is interior but coherent. Closure is valid, though the cost is more declared ("burden and blessing") than shown through a persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes her vigil as an endless, luminous burden—cost is felt in “quietly luminous way.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated returns to the same footage deepen the emotional tonnage, and the river stone’s warming supplies a persistent constraint. Orientation is swift—who/where/when taught by line 3. One minor loop: “softly deliberate” is reused without reweighting, but it does not touch the final image. Overall, a clean, lyrical Earned Stasis that reconfigures meaning without tidy catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the folded cloth holds both the irreversible betrayal and the fragile new stance, cost legible in “fragile weight of restoration.” Accumulative lens holds throughout—each affixed scale deepens pattern until starlight reweights the object. Orientation is clear by line 4; no ambiguity break. One soft spot: the “tomorrow” sentence projects past the story’s edge, slightly diluting final compression.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hourglass finishes, frost melts, and Maya’s stance toward her scars flips with undeniable emotional cost (“more awake than she had ever been”). Causal chain holds—hourglass triggers plant memory → tunnel → brother’s prints → reparative recognition—each beat tightening options under the Accumulative lens. One tiny causal gap: the tunnel entrance appears without prior setup, but the coffee-cup chronology retrofits motivation cleanly. Meets 9+ cost test on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional residue layers thicken until the final image reweights the stake—Mira leaves the film untouched, a Charged Poise that makes “unused love” an undeniable permanent resident. Causality is interior and cumulative rather than event-based; each vision beat deepens density until the refusal crystallizes option. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure cost is legible in the final sentence: she carries “the particular peace that comes from witnessing an ending finally allowed to rest.”

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal arc: creative paralysis → stillness → release. Orientation is rapid; the astrolabe anchors time/place by word 30. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—creativity pours forth after she relinquishes pursuit—cost is the irreversible abandonment of her former agonized method.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s “sparks” line crystallizes her stance, reweighting the chess-clock pause from abstract relic to conceptual price under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift (who, where, cargo named by line 5), causality is loose but coherent—each beat adds atmospheric density rather than because/therefore turns, appropriate to this lens. The merchant encounter supplies one tightening micro-turn that forecloses sale without blood, satisfying the single-deepening rule. Cost is conceptual yet felt: she shoulders the archive’s unmeasurable weight and keeps hope suspended.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each morning’s new clearing and gear incrementally deepen pattern until the final resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Transitions across sleeps are legible via repeated cue (“different clearing,” “small gear”). Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—no “back to return to.” One beat could tighten causal linkage (why this gear now?), but the pattern pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of looping path, deepening twilight, and recurring leash image tightens stakes by reweighting rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise—ticket punch warm, middle path taken—cost is felt in the shed skin of leash and the violet dark ahead. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within first 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One scuff: “courage hides” mini-lecture momentarily externalizes what the image had earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory shard adds weight until the bronze dust trail reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marcus keeps climbing, safety’s cost now legible—paid for by the bolt’s weight and the snow-notes image. Orientation is swift; causality never breaks; the single tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation pause crystallizes the trap and the promised future reaction, reweighting centuries of quiet labor with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—no because/therefore beat after the ink setup—but the accumulative pattern (annotations → future blood reaction) holds under Accumulative lens. A single tightening turn is sufficient at this length; the final “graceful collapse” line pays off the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the new coral colony reweights the premise that “paths disappear” into “paths transform,” with the atlas coastline now permanently erased yet biologically rerouted. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: the buoy data pattern break is the because/therefore trigger that reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the final image—her father’s obsolete map now literal detritus beneath a station that is itself “perpetually between states.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Kira’s kneel-to-rise sequence reconfigures the rebellion’s meaning from grief-weighted waiting to purpose reclaimed, cost registered in the stone circle’s intensifying hum. Causal chain holds—grandmother’s glasses → memory anchoring → circle resonance → decision to reignite—though the “how” of transmitting the hum to others is elided, a minor motivational ellipsis rather than a rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to unseal is irrevocable, embryo warmth signals conceptual cost, plants’ hush confirms stakes have reconfigured. Causal chain holds—lightning gift → kite map → greenhouse chamber—each because/therefore step narrows options. One unobtrusive time-jump (dawn arrival) is anchored by fogged panes and hot-spring steam. Orientation beats the 120-word checkpoint; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each greenhouse act adds density until the single cereus bloom delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration—optimism re-priced as perishable yet possible. Causality is interior but coherent; every repeated freeze → soil-under-nails sensation tightens the loop. The photograph functions as charged object, its wrinkle pattern echoing the cereus petals, giving the final image conceptual cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse/sea anchors arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored box and her re-threaded perception reweight the premise with conceptual cost (she can no longer pin faces to single truths). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each luminous knot is a pattern break that deepens density until meaning flips. Orientation is waived; initial disorientation (“the sea seemed to have forgotten”) pays off in the final inversion. One minor loop: “the question was rhetorical; she already knew the answer” appears twice without fresh charge, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: tracker’s body fades while consciousness expands, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ink patterns and drone footage layer until the world dissolves. Orientation is clear by 120 wds; causality is loose under accumulative design, so no penalty. One minor loop: “three days ago… three days more” restates without new pressure, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: letter arrives → truths crack belief → she transmits. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the networks awaken, silence shifts to held breath. Orientation within 120 words; no lens drift. Could use one sentence of concrete consequence preview to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the roses’ persistence reconfigures the meaning of “peace” with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is implied rather than chained, but the final image reweights all prior material. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices at this length, and the canvas-to-rose contrast supplies the required constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silence he voices reconfigures sky patterns and charges the spike with goddess-echo; cost is the unspoken forfeiture of his former perceptual world. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each garden resonance thickens pattern until cadence shifts at the final non-sound. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 80; no ambiguity. No causal contradiction; sleepwalking constellations complicate but do not resolve, satisfying lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the proof-by-contradiction reconfigures Eleanor’s stance, crystallizing a new offensive path. Causal lens holds: each generational sin is a because-link that tightens her present necessity. Orientation is secure within the first 120 words (phone call, stair count, dome). Cost is visible—“the whole city spread out like an unfinished story” signals the burden of truthful authorship she now accepts. A persistent constraint emerges: she must act before the journalist’s evidence is weaponized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: amber firmware → coordinates → folded-time chamber → rewrite attempt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she begins mapping on the looping cradle-scene, cost felt in trembling hands and the unsaid risk of erasing herself. Orientation is taught by 90 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile insertion crystallizes an emergent hush that reweights her art from permanence to impermanence, with felt cost (“the tile had become strangely warm”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk dust, mist, and tile resonance layer until pattern break at center mandala. Orientation anchored within 120 words and causality intact. One meaningful tightening—no reversal required under this lens—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tessera stops shifting, the bell rings, and the cost—her permanent exile in past-bleed—remains. Causal chain holds: because she cannot save the dead, she renames the living; therefore the boy inherits an “unburnable” empathy. Orientation is swift—ash, fountain, minaret shards within 120 words. One minor elasticity: the bell’s first ring is unattributed and risks deus ex machina, but the prior paragraph’s “resurrection” primes it enough to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered echoes reweight possibility rather than causal chain. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty. Single scene, two on-page characters, one seamless transition through glass. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the coin’s release crystallizes both women’s stakes and reconfigures Elara’s exile into gift; cost visible in “weight of the coin lift from her palm.” Persistent constraint: her spectral limbo persists, only the reason changes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the decision to “document everything” crystallizes a new stance with visible forfeit of her earlier detachment. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break (fractal light) reweights the stake of human connection. Causality is soft but coherent within lyric mode; orientation anchors within 120 words and the pattern holds to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pulse of algae and heat-signature adds density until the elm leaf reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Maren’s stance crystallizes—yet the cost is felt more as epiphany than forfeiture, keeping the resonance strong but not quite at the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the High Seers accept her living system, reweighting prophecy from sealed scrolls to breathable cloth. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-build through catalogued fragments until the canyon echo reframes meaning. Cost is conceptual but legible: prophecy loses fixity, and Elara’s life-work becomes Sisyphean stewardship. One causal gap—why the jar was ever mis-shelved—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s pillbox transfer reweights her self-definition and the wider conspiracy stake with felt conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: spiral/cross/line snow codes motivate ascent → ally appears → pillbox offered, each because/therefore link narrowing future danger. Single-scene orientation locked within 120 words, no ambiguity. Drive lens is Causal; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the barge acceptance reconfigures the promise from abstract burden to lived continuation, with conceptual cost (he’ll keep carrying, never arrive). Accumulative lens holds—density of fog, needle, ticking gutters layers until the final image reweights meaning—but the middle repeats the same reflection beat three times, slightly blunting the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each imagistic layer (kiln, glaze, beekeeper gentleness, lantern thrum) adds density until the final Charged Poise reweights “sharp gentleness” as cutting. Orientation clean by 120 w. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she now shoulders the oasis frequency, a living constraint. One minor causality gap: how she “knew” the right moment remains intuitive, but the pattern teaches mystic pacing early enough to excuse.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cutting planted in moonlight reconfigures both mourners’ stances while the rose’s unseen roots pay the deferred cost. Causal linkage holds: girl’s grief → climb → gift → joint planting, each beat narrowing emotional options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated hush/oar/gauge motifs tighten until the final image reweights “waiting” as active creation. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and the harbor frame stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: rising tide → floating books → mirrored selves → new atlas forms a seamless cadence shift. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—extinction repurposed into genesis—visible when “the brass sundial’s hum rose…in welcome”; the price is the eternal burden of bearing extinct memories, felt in the final choral image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to build the public nest reweights her lifetime of anonymous labor into shared art, cost paid in the exposure of private words. Accumulative lens holds: storm → found nest → spiral pattern → installation idea, each beat adding density. The 120-word anchor is met; spatial logic clean. One tightening beat suffices; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: subsonic manipulation detected → charts consulted → counter-frequency calculated → interference reversed, with visible campus thaw as Decisive Change. Orientation is swift; closure carries cost via the dawn antenna tremor and her exhaustion. One non-closure lapse: “they had discovered…” shifts to omniscient exposition mid-scene, slightly blurring lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: fear → compass cue → organ paralysis → memory trigger → key retrieval → stance flip, all on-page. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tunnels re-perceived as “passages of possibility” carries conceptual cost—she now bears the key and the silence-breaking duty. Orientation and lens are clear by 120 words; one minor lull during the organ description slows momentum but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon → quarry → pigment → portrait accretes emotional density until final “exhale” reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: canvas rolled, fog lifts, cost is the quarry’s unchanging silence and Elena’s perpetuation of bearing witness; legible before/after for reader. Orientation clean; causality is associative, not beat-by-beat, yet pattern is taught early. One hairline slip: “lance” used as transitive verb without prior warrant, momentarily jars linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: nail → maps → restricted archives → decoded journals → irreversible knowledge → decision to break silence. One clear transition (basement → rising to face researchers) keeps the two-shard default; orientation is anchored by word 80. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses compliance with a visible cost (“senior researchers would never permit… alternative was to perpetuate that silence”). Lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the flake’s aerial projection reframes every prior bridge-song into a taxonomy of possible returns, felt cost in her lifelong compulsion to retell. Causal chain is lyric-associative (accumulative lens) rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early via bridges-as-thresholds and paid off when the netting-map dissolves in the rear-view. One scaffold loop—“the particular silence that fell between songs when strangers' faces softened into memory” vs. near-identical reprise—barely grazes the final image, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the couple choose deliberate dissolution over acquisition, costed by the cash they walk away from. Causal lens holds: “territorial markers” argument → Elena’s request for help = decisive tightening. Foreign bill and circus cars keep spatial continuity; time is one evening; no orientation debt. The line “clean starts are just circles…” reweights the premise, satisfying CR.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her labor from solitary decoding to communal witness, and the image of the continuing Cepheid pulse externalizes the cost of endless stewardship. Accumulative lens holds—pattern recognition builds across dream journals, telegram, star curves, then crystallizes. One soft causality gap: the telegram’s urgency is asserted but no concrete consequence threatens if she delays.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the spell froze, therefore Kaelen returns; because he unbends and walks expanding circles, therefore the dome cracks and the seed can feed. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex becomes a still pool, his shame becomes soil, and the cost—“older than he had expected”—is felt in the mirrored face. One mild paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: planting the clipping reconfigures her from passive receptor to active bridge, the price being irreversible fusion with every future dream; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern intensifies until the membrane image crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot’s fall re-weights the bargain, the sister-tree glows, Elara exits with hollowed joy forever legible. Causal chain holds—card bought → orchard reached → sacrifice activated—under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each bone-root image thickens density until the golden apple beat crystallizes cost. Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props or late rule patches.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the decision to go to Elko reconfigures silence from refuge to possible re-entry, cost felt in the quarry wind that “feels larger and lonelier.” Causal chain holds—televised failure → loss of voice → amp message → choice—each because/therefore legible. One transition (office → memory → office) is clean; orientation anchored by word 80. No prop or information teleporting; the grille cloth and amp are properly seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (warm bark, glowing seed, unfolding starlight pages) deepens the stake until knowledge itself is re-priced. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she forfeits monumental fame for quiet transmission—felt cost visible in “she wept…transition itself felt like coming home.” A hairline slip: the arbor’s magnetic physics is named but never constrains tactics, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library’s hush crystallizes the permanent shore where nothing is lost, and the cost is the endless continuation of the ritual itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern deepens through tidal/moon cadence until the final image reweights “routine” into wonder. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean. However, the piece never tightens once; the ritual cycle simply re-states its premise, so the reconfiguration feels inevitable rather than wrested from a turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: each new reflection inside the crystals deepens the central stake (walls vs. connection) rather than causally reversing it. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pearl ascending becomes the container of confessed hopes, reconfiguring Margret’s future duties with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—“the first crack had been made.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy density, layered graffiti, and taped leather accrue until the final crystallizing image. Closure is a Charged Poise—she does not play, but the option’s foreclosure carries conceptual cost (“stubborn refusal to be discarded”). The—20% reflective block is anchored to tactile cues (rust stain, cracked bellows) and alters present options. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library opens only after the watch’s silence signals paid cost, and the backward-spinning hands reweight the premise that time is layered pages. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each looped image (book with her future handwriting, letters arriving at temporal hinges) tightens the stake. Orientation is anchored by 120 words through mist, marble steps, and the watch. One causality hairline: the door “exists only when viewed through the watch’s reflective surface” is revealed late, but it is foreshadowed by the grandfather’s rule, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the first note reconfigures both futures and the cost is felt in the frost that “should not have existed.” Accumulative pattern—gaps in ownership, plant whispers, coffee images—tightens until the bow-stroke crystallizes meaning. One micro-turn (the wisteria’s caution) is enough; no因果 chain breaks. Lens holds lyric-accumulative throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald’s new “living light” is an undeniable conceptual cost, reframing her vocation from cosmetic restoration to soul theft; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of aurora/grotto/stillness deepens until the final crystallization—so causality is not required, yet the piece satisfies the 9+ quick test for Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ash-tree summit rewrites her premise—contentment is the cycle, not its end—and she descends to enact that stance. One causal filament wobbles: forgiving Aldric is summarized rather than dramatized, so the emotional fulcrum feels reported, not tested. Orientation, lens, and cost land cleanly; the final image of the glowing scallop hairpin crystallizes the stakes under an accumulative/textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (chimes, mirror, wind, light) deepens the dominant stake—her need to keep doubt alive without losing herself. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scattering of thoughts crystallizes her ongoing stance and forecloses rest. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. Cost is present but diffuse (fatigue, perpetual vulnerability); stronger if a concrete consequence were foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the ripple pattern and held to the end; the final image of Mina pitching her own stone delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when legible), and each sensory ring tightens the texture rather than stalls momentum. No causal breaks or teleporting props; the withheld revelation is paid off in the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the renunciation of physical departure is restated with tonal solemnity, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is circular, not progressive—each paragraph re-samples the same stasis—so the tightening is poetic density rather than option reduction. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, meeting the single-scene window. No meaningful cost is newly dramatized at the final image, keeping the beat short of the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final garden image reweights her prior “underachievement” as sacred preparation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is light—keystone warmth triggers wards to drop, mist arrives—but the piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it; the cadence shift from automated ice to impossible garden is the tightening. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no penalties applied.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sees the hum, renounces active searching, and the image reweights all prior effort with conceptual cost. “Meteor hush” final line reprises opening lanterns, locking RR. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of patience taught early, paid off when light “made visible” rewards quiet attention. Causality intact: no late rules, no off-stage resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cosmos contracts, prophecy reverses, and Kira’s role shifts from seeker to witness—cost is the lifelong solitude this vantage demands. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of coin-casting + static distillation thickens until meaning condenses. Orientation is clear by line 5; no caps triggered. However, the middle third loops—“she would cast…listen…cast…listen”—without tightening options; escalation is present but gentle, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final naming crystallizes her stance and reweights the atlas from threat to toolkit under the Accumulative lens. Each beat layers density—box, recording, page, scattered light—rather than causal reversals, tightening until the last image (“she was not afraid”) reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the hollow chest remains absent, shaping every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell’s first post-repair ring re-tethers village to sea while the mage accepts lifelong servitude; cost is legible in the aching arms and the “faint drip” that now underlies every future peal. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip-pattern density increases until meaning reweights; no causal gymnastics, no orientation drift, no late-rule patch.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: dawn arrival of other wardens makes the coming re-flood inevitable, while Elara’s ordered photographs guarantee the stories stay surfaced. Causality is tight—every beat (label find, bottle cache, photo trail) is a because/therefore link that narrows her options to public witness. Cost is unmistakable: personal safety and career are now hostage to the story she carries. Lens holds as causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—she realizes she “had been the crystal”—but the cost is only asserted, not shown on-page; the flame appears after the transformation, so causality is retroactive. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of starlings + rainbow waterfall builds toward a cadence shift rather than a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear by ~90 words, but the single scene meanders without a tightening midpoint; pressure plateaus until the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: radio silence → recalculation → revised heading → safe emergence, each beat tightening options. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the buckle loosened, storm behind, next watch already begun—cost felt in the ache of knuckles and the quiet hum of open channels. One hairline slip: the storm’s “shift” is announced rather than shown, a micro-tell that keeps it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the blade touch vivifies both selves and locks them into a new, shared ontology. Causal lens holds throughout (“because” the cut, “therefore” the crack in numbness). Cost is unmistakable on the page: “The numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute.” No orientation debt; spatial choreography of floating stones and upward-falling leaves stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed stillness and room iterations accumulate until perception is re-weighted. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the hush of things about to bloom”—with conceptual cost (radical patience over monetized speed), legible on the final page. Orientation anchors within 120 words; single transition from storm to porch is clean, no spatial drift. No causal break, though escalation is more tonal accretion than tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure wants to be Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final image—laughter possibly returning “when the time was right”—is conditional, off-stage, and unpaid. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pull adds sonic texture, yet no pattern break or cadence shift tightens stakes; the last pull is interchangeable with the first. Orientation is clear, but causality remains slack because the house’s grief neither resists nor adapts to the sound waves.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: mist density, pendant warmth, and word-seeds layer until the guardian’s stance crystallizes—“waiting becomes preparation.” Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the boundary of light reweights from prison to threshold with felt cost (years lost). Orientation clear by ~70 words. One pattern break—pendant arrival—taught early. No causal chain, none required under lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the second snap ignites unnamed-colored flames and releases seventeen years of borrowed energy, cost paid on the page. Causal lens holds: each failed approximation logically narrows to the subtraction insight that fuels the final act. Orientation is anchored by word 45 (ember nexus, violet twilight, three fire pits). One minor retroactive cue—“she had carried this relic for seventeen years”—is cleanly embedded in present action, so no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe's recursive rhythm reweights her premise with undeniable cost—she abandons quantifiable science for intuitive listening. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (tower, gorge, lunar perigee). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break of geometric silence intensifies density, cadence shift in final paragraph reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—she can never again filter first—shapes implied future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Maren steps into the nexus, ferry stabilizes, timelines merge, and she accepts permanent transience—an Earned Stasis with visible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: urgent radio → recognition of instability → voluntary merger → grotto solidifies. One transition (dock → intersection) is legible; orientation anchors inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is a single, continuous scene with one causal through-line: the weaving of sinew thread that gradually re-calibrates the gallery and her own perception until the low-key “eruption” tightens stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she stays among her threads, options re-weighted—so cost is conceptual (she will never sort real from implanted memory), satisfying the lens of Accumulative/Textural. World anchors arrive by ~110 words; no orientation debt. A hair’s-breadth shy of 9 because the cost, though legible, could be even sharper on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: arrival of alien light → edge geometry study → visitors’ departure deadline tightens Mira’s options to a crystallized stance. The anchor link, introduced in paragraph one, returns to “rest against her leg” then is taken “in hand” in the final sentence, supplying a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights ancestral ballast into navigational instrument. The orientation anchor is clear by line 8; no debt applies. Closure cost is felt: the aliens leave tomorrow, taking easy star-sail away; her new path is unaided, depth-charged with infinity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dead don’t need answers, only witnesses—an insight that reweights Elena’s job. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (pulse → whisper → location) tightens the stake rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The cost is present yet diffuse (Elena’s worldview shifts), so the beat satisfies the 9+ quick test only partially.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the ocean pressed in, but it was no longer a prison. It was a library, and they had finally learned to read” makes the cost (loss of human corporeality) undeniable. Causal chain holds: tidal window → flooded lab → dry chamber → gold map → phase transition → stay. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; facility geography stays coherent. One soft spot: “she understood then why Elara had never returned” is slightly declarative; still, the reweighting lands.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira stops counting, accepts the ghost’s apology, and the heartbeat becomes ambient—cost is the lifetime she spent tallying erasure. Accumulative lens holds: ink patterns, pulse totals, and snow depth tighten texture until the final quiet reweights meaning; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curse lifts while a new language is born from dying syllables and bird-helix, cost legible in the diamond’s cold-fire blaze; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (17 bird-words, sedimented pronunciations) tightens until meaning becomes texture—orientation is anchored by word 80, and no causal break mars the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira crosses into the “harmony untamed,” reconfiguring her options with the garden’s vibration as felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is secure by ~100 words. The persistent constraint (gravity play, creature frequency) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each bridge crossed, each sensory layer (honey, storm, tarnish) thickens the stake until the locust shell catalyzes pattern-break. Closure lands as Charged Poise: shell released among roots, statues bend, fruit brightens—undeniable reconfiguration with felt cost (her former life left behind). Orientation is anchored by word 68 (“twelfth bridge”). No causal loopholes; every image pays into the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: contested border → mail drop → Aram’s need → Marcus’s decision → fence crossing, each beat tightening illegality. Closure is a Decisive Change: Marcus shifts from state-sanctioned courier to active smuggler, cost legible in the criminal package now in his bag. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Orientation complete by line 12 with arcade, dusk, and disputed zone; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the halo fragment reframes his craft and future carousel, cost is implied but not yet concrete. Wrong-turn mechanics are magical realism without setup, so causality is situational/lyric rather than strictly causal; lens holds by accumulation. Orientation clears by ~130 words; no penalty. One meaningful deepening—the halo discovery—reweights stakes; sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a gentle CR: the scarf’s luminosity re-weights “analog memory” from private loss to shareable artifact, with conceptual cost—once reawakened, the story must leave the library again. The hyperbolic room is the causal engine, but the library itself, not Miriam, supplies the decisive turn; her ritual is observational. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern build → density shift → re-pricing. Orientation is swift and topology is taught early, so no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each donated box and sunrise layer thickens the library’s haunted archive until the 1832 photograph reframes Mira’s own longing, delivering a Charged Poise that reweights every prior act of salvage. Causality is loose—palette rules are intuited rather than tested under opposition—yet the final image of the stilled dream hanging in morning light carries undeniable conceptual cost: she now tends her own captured absence. One transition (ferry schedule to dawn) is legible; orientation anchors within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the clay sentence re-prices the entire quest, the lock of hair acts as both key and conceptual cost, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Orientation is swift and the single transition (wall → fountain) is legible; causality is thin—star-guidance is poetic fiat—but the final image satisfies the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: each pass through the drowned greenhouse thickens pattern (shattered Heron → re-assembled Heron) until the final image crystallizes stance with undeniable cost—he regains memory but loses empirical distance forever; orientation is anchored by word 80, causality is lyric-not-linear but coherent, closure is Charged Poise with salt-weep as felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the swing outside waits, the children remain in over-large chairs, and Maren’s nod acknowledges a battle won at visible emotional cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—tea-leaf geometry and backward steps pattern toward the final crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word ~80; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the phrase “reversible exile” is named rather than dramatized as a live option, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted seed crystallizes a Charged Poise where wonder is re-rooted into this world, and the waterfall’s swell signals the cost of perpetual guardianship. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds. However, orientation is soft—neither the realm of fading color nor the rules of inter-world pruning are cued concretely within the first 120 words, so the reader trusts lyricism before grounding, warranting −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands via Charged Poise: the released spirit mirrors child-Mira, re-weighting her lifelong task in one image, cost felt in the audible shatter of accumulated silence. Causal chain is lean but intact—binding fails → reverse-knot ritual → revelation. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Only the slightest causality wobble: the elder’s “confession” hints at collective guilt yet never translates into tangible obstacle or price for Mira, keeping the beat just shy of decisive tension.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena exits without forcing the door, a resonant reconfiguration that carries conceptual cost (“some truths require patience”). Causality is accumulative/textural; the comparison of film frames supplies the single tightening that reweights the stake. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 120 words and supports the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the note and globe re-weight loss into transition while Miriam accepts the cost—“she would find the daughter… understand how to let go.” Drive lens Accumulative/Textural holds from first line (“amber silence… collapsed into something more honest”) to final smile, with pattern-taught compression and a single effective deepening pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each-song-layer thickens until the closing harmony reweights the premise—two balladeers fuse into one transmission, the cost is the irrevocable sharing of her private frequency. Pattern taught by word 150, closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: her voice is no longer hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira steps onto the deck cradling the goggles, knowledge reweighting her view of Jansen and herself; the cost is the secret she must now carry. Causal chain is tight—uneven ridge → pries → reads → re-hides—each beat tightening her options. Orientation is clean inside the elevator by line 4; the flash back/forward inside the diary is handled in-scene without breaking continuity. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the climbing car and refracted light density-build toward the crystallized final image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last image of wholeness being “spooled together” reweights all prior broken-string motifs with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—each cloud naming is because/therefore driven by grief and agency—under the Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens once at the spiral-cloud beat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens inferred: each beat advances because Mira acts on the coin’s cue. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the painted ceiling reweights “limits” into “different scales of perception,” a cost legible in the imminent demolition. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; one soft spot is the guild politics paragraph that tells rather than tests stakes. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient: the approaching wrecking ball tightens time and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hopscotch-board cipher reweights the starlings’ meaning and Mira’s future. Causal chain is thin—luminance simply appears, pattern merely noticed—but under Accumulative lens the density of mirrored geometries satisfactorily reconfigures her world; cost is the sleepless vigil she willingly pays.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final step into multiplying mirrors reconfigures her vocation forever, and the price—the irreversible loss of the gear set—is legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dissolved gear thickens the pattern until the mirror parts. Orientation is swift; causality remains intact. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the last gear vanishes and the passage opens—no reversals are needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: chalk messages, shared labor, and finally the bell’s resonance layer density until the sky answers. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration— the bell’s ring re-weights the nebula and the community’s self-image, with felt cost in the decades of neglect they must now admit. Orientation is established by line 3; no penalty. One tight deepening suffices and is delivered when the bell summons real weather, crystallizing the “brambled hope.” Causality stays associative rather than because/therefore, but that is legit under the Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—nested gears, lullaby fragments, bruised light—and returns to reweight them in the final image (“the clock chimed once… waiting for the next song”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the universe inhaled, the documented beauty now held, the cost irreversible silence. Causality is interior but coherent: because she adjusts, the memory is preserved; because she accepts endings, she does not flinch. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dusk, and purple hour are anchored within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the stone flower opens, path revealed, travelers implicitly saved, and Mira’s irrevocable commitment sealed by the grinding “almost music,” a felt cost that reweights her prior silence. Causal chain holds—nut→depression→mechanism—under a single continuous scene; blueprint gaps create credible ellipsis rather than convenience. Orientation is anchored by word 60 and the lens stays accumulative-textural, tightening cadence toward the frost deadline without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure hits as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis reweights from relic to warrant of transformation, foam spiral supplies the catalytic image, and the cost is the permanent absence of the mother she can now carry differently. Causal chain is lean but intact—email → ravine → foam insight → pocketing—with no teleporting props. Single-scene orientation is anchored by word 80; braided ravine and snowmelt date the moment. One micro-turn suffices under Accumulative lens: density of foam imagery tightens until pattern break delivers the re-cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The concept of “quantifying absence” supplies a conceptual Decisive Change: she reframes her merchandise from blank to pregnant with chosen silence. Cost is conceptual, not felt—no consequence or constraint is visible on her future business. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds and lands. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens: each coral contact and counter-dish thickens texture until the final exhausted sunrise reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate; the pavilion’s logic is taught through tactile discovery rather than exposition. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion lighter, Miriam cracked, cost felt in “sturdy brittle.” Persistent constraint—the gift that once isolated her now depleted her—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chime re-synchronizes town and clock, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (old grievances loosed). Causal chain is sound—weight found → brothers brought → cooperative forms—yet the mid-story montage of languages and weeks-of-work is elliptical, blurring the decisive tightening beat that forces the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the mirror’s reweighting of landscape and purpose is legible, irreversible, and carries conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—finding mirror → neural rewrite → new vocation—each beat because/therefore. Orientation is nailed by word 50; no lens drift. Only the off-page chorus of prior dreamers is accepted ellipsis under 800-word license.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inverted patterns resolve into a “way of thinking” that reweights all prior knowledge, cost paid in the one-hour forfeiture and future solitude. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent: each upward-falling image thickens density until the final reconfiguration. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at word ~70 (“serpentine grotto’s mouth”), waiving any penalty. One soft spot: head archivist prohibition is mentioned but never surfaces as live obstacle, so the return feels pre-approved rather than risk-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grove’s sudden resonance reweights the premise—silence is no longer absolute—while the cost (the fragile, possibly one-off nature of the chord) is felt in the conditional “began to call.” Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (moss, cracks, strum) thickens until the pattern breaks into song. Orientation is clean by line 5; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ambient-lyric lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held: magnetic images accrete until the final “exhalation” reweights exile as vocation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no temporal or spatial drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—tutor forecloses speech forever, cost felt in “teach without speaking”—but the beat is summary, not dramatized action, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence variety is a layer whose density peaks when the firework roar momentarily lets the clasp’s note through. Closure is a Charged Poise: the diary clicks open and Mira rewrites her own rule—silence after joy, not loss—reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3 and evolve with the firework countdown. Causality is intact: the resonator tuning leads directly to the audible note that releases the clasp; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: elderflower → wrapping-doodle → corpse-flower pollen pattern reweights ambition into serenity. Closure is a Charged Poise—the wildflower doodle crystallizes the new hierarchy with undeniable conceptual cost (she will never again rush for recognition). Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks; single time-jump “three months” is cued by “turning of the tide’s thought.” Persistent constraint (hyper-sensitive nose) shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ascending water, hanging foliage, bell-grind of stone) deepens stakes without causal zig-zags until the arrow bloom compresses time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow stays, her knowledge leaves, cost crystallized in “second skin” and “ordinary miracle.” No orientation drift; who/where/when settled by line 4. One micro-scaffold: “She would leave...as the others had done” states the choice just after dramatized clasp—minor but visible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pattern she reads rewrites the “accident” into engineered convergence, with the fog-writ wind-marks as felt cost. Causal chain holds—survey → data → reclassification—under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (entry → amphitheatre) is clean. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds (whispered coordinates → amber sheet → bell → aurora convergence) until a single cadence shift reweights the premise. Anchors are clear by word 80; the Orientation Test is satisfied. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—wonder is “certified” and the aurora carries that charge outward—so the before/after is legible and the conceptual cost (the world’s slow cooling might now be arrested) is on the page. The only slack is that the sculptor beat is elliptical: it complicates but never intersects causally with Yara’s act, so the tightening feels atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each driftwood marker and echo layer deepens the stake of “how to carry failure.” Closure is a Charged Poise—she rises with the flute, stance reconfigured, silence now a deliberate vocation rather than paralysis. Cost is legible in the final sentence: the guardianship path is foreclosed, humility installed. One causal gap: the Weaving itself is never shown or re-shown, so the reader must take the catastrophe on faith; because the story’s engine is her response, not the event, the gap is tolerable.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ending lands a Conceptual Repricing: “the mathematics of emotion required…an endless transcription of questions,” reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—her dissolved body. Causal linkage is lyric but legible: halo arrival → empathy extraction → star vanishing → self-dissolution, each because/therefore step tightening the noose on intact personhood. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by sentence one—“topaz workshop,” “seventeen years,” “roofless”—so the early lyric disorientation is waived and pays off in the roofless final image. Persistent constraint: every borrowed personality exacts a fragment of her own, visible in the growing translucency.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s vibration reweights Elara’s vocation from relic carrier to wonder-seeder, cost legible in the lone descent. Causal lens holds—each beat (climb, reveal, vibration, visitation) tightens options until the mentor’s dissolve forecloses reunion and crystallizes legacy. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “a hundred deliveries, a hundred ordinary handoffs” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the arbor’s quartz and frost function as an emotional archive whose density increases until Mira sees her own reflection inside it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she smiles at the future visitor, accepting her absorption as cost. The pattern is taught by 25 % and the final image reweights every prior frost-feather. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: each puzzle edge acquired “hummed with recognition,” establishing the rule that only her body can complete the pattern. The climax is a Decisive Change—she becomes the message—priced on-page by the empty loom and vanished bead. Setup anchors who/where/when within 60 words; no orientation debt. No teleporting props; the amber’s glow is tethered to her heartbeat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece uses Accumulative/Textural linkage: each underground foray adds density until the first pale blossom reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. The silk’s early appearance as payment → buried lattice → unseen root-warming creates a coherent pattern that lands in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard breathes again). Closure is legible under the dominant lens; no causal break or orientation drift occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kira renounces the rescue fantasy and accepts perpetual transit; the conceptual cost—“she would forever weave between worlds”—is on-page. Causal chain holds: shard-touch → membrane-thin → self-confrontation → renunciation. One soft patch: the first mention of “redirect the flow” is abstract; the concrete action (pressing shard to panel) arrives late, so motivation lags ~100 words. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lamp reignites as Maren’s sea-glass-weighted pocket empties her grandmother’s unfinished grief into the beam. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each stone stack intensifies the pattern until the seven-stone tower rekindles the light. Time, place, and POV anchor within the first 120 words; no orientation debt. The ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost—she leaves with “heavier pockets of meaning,” foreclosing her former silent detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: laughing herald alone holds knowledge of three ships saved, cost of eternal solitude felt in “burden and gift.” Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of laughter → light → refraction → safe passage tightens once. Orientation clear by 120 w. Causality soft (no turn, only deepening) but coherent under lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wing-light patterns and valley mist density escalate meaning rather than plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—Yuen lifts the wing, sun trails re-weight his future—cost is the lifetime stewardship he now accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One soft beat: “he understood then” is a micro-epiphany that could be more embodied, but it lands inside color-action, not abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth literally unfolds under her moonlit gaze, reframing maintenance as compassionate unmaking; cost is felt in the phrase “heal by first understanding the full weight of what has been broken.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dream-mapped layer adds density until the pattern inverts. Orientation is immediate (tower, storm, night), transitions are clean, and the single shard satisfies Track A scope.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the released dawn refracts through the shattered mica, charging the realm with hope while Elara’s identity is the price—an unmistakable before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each re-wound strip of song thickens the pattern until the cadence break of shattering glass reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by the phosphorescent greenhouse; no causal or spatial drift intrudes. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber motes → philosophy of errors → midnight hush builds density that reweights the stake of leaving vs staying. Closure lands as Charged Poise: tomorrow she will write—option reconfigured, cost felt in the paper tear and the bell memory. The invitation’s delayed appearance after 400+ words of exposition weakens the causal spark; the story risks orientation drift before the object finally anchors the present dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each small tending beat layers density until the butterfly lift reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bread shared, wings dried—felt cost is the slow lifelong custodianship she recommits to; causality is internally sound, though a single-scene default is gently stretched by the montage sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s mission flips from binding spells to curating stories, and the cost is her life’s premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each observed fade deepens pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is swift; the dome, frost shelves, and twilight clock anchor by line 3. No causal break; the fade→story shift is seeded in the first slide reading.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fob warms, sunrise nears, and Mara faces the audible fracture of trust—an imagistic RR with conceptual cost. Causality holds: each false start tightens her willingness to stay, so the final standoff is earned. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. The only drag is a mid-scene loop of “learned patience / watched rhythm” that slightly stalls escalation before the scarred woman appears.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the compass/taste combo reweights belief into wonder with felt cost (“tasted like possibility…”). Causal chain is present—compass summons Seren → dialogue reframes premise—but the escalation is accumulative/textural rather than because/therefore; luck brings Seren, not Mira’s agency. Orientation anchors by word 30; no drift. Under the Accumulative lens the final aurora-taste image successfully reconfigures meaning, but the cost is oblique, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first stroke rewrites the姊妹 power dynamic and accepts perpetual ethical debt; cost is legible in “I begin” under the ancestral gaze of an unfinished face. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (charcoal, lock, crystal light) deepens thematic density until the final shaft re-weights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 7 (who, where, when). One minor nick: the diary coordinates appear once without prior cue; still, they function as inherited trigger, not coincidence, so causality survives.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the candlelit room becomes a garden again because Mira chooses to write, reweighting the premise that candor can still grow. The zinc plate’s coordinates trigger the journey; the shredded map supplies causal steps; the “lost conversations” wall supplies visible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hidden/gilded words thickens until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor looseness: the plate’s secondary etching is revealed by a quick tilt to flame, a micro-convenience that slightly dulls the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers density—ice, metal, light, silence—until the final image reweights the stakes with conceptual cost (the bluff’s endless conversation). Orientation is immediate; spatial anchors tight. Closure is a Charged Poise: no decision reverses, yet the reader feels the price of perpetual tuning. The persistent constraint (seasonal voicelessness) shapes the whole arc and is legible in the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density rises like static, then resolves into quiet crystalline cadence. Closure is Charged Poise—“strange and organic and beautifully broken” reweights every prior mention of circuits vs pulse. Orientation anchored by word 40 (desert rose farm, domes, wandering north). Single causal gap—how “miniaturize chaos” mechanically fixes magnetic drift—but metaphoric logic is taught early and paid off in final image; cost is her emptied chest cavity, not world mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: letters, locket, and stories layer until meaning accrues. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elena reframes her job as "curation of memory." Cost is nominal: she loses nothing, risks nothing; the mailbox opens easily once Mrs. Okonkwo hands over a key. Causality is loose: scratches on brass do not logically imply hidden letters, and the grandmother’s breadcrumb plan is retro-fitted exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of water, dice, coded pages, and dance accrues until the drainage reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when clear by line 3; no penalty applied. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the dry floor and collected dice visibly re-price her years of captivity into agency. Cost is legible in the single line “collected her dice” — the tool of endurance now weaponized for the next fight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal touch reconfigures Mira’s identity and the town’s forgotten past with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (beached whale, salt crystals, coffee-ground map) layers density until the final crystalline silence reweights meaning. One minor orientation waiver: “the chamber beneath the lighthouse” appears late with no prior spatial cue, but the pattern pays off at closure so the penalty is waived. The cost is legible in the image of her mother’s living face trapped in salt—loss made permanent—meeting the 9+ quick test for closure quality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reweights from immutable fate to “frequency that could be tuned,” and the cost is the surrender of predictive certainty itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each hush-layer (brook, frogs, paper wing) thickens silence until meaning, not event, is altered. The origami wing’s journey downstream is the charged image that makes the before/after legible. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where) is taught after ~120 words, but the delay is purposeful and pays off in the final stillness, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena’s hand-clasp reconfigures their contract, cost is the foregone confession. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rooftop session layers architectural syntax until meteor night crystallizes the unstated pact. Causality intact: borrowed sugar → tea → roof → meteor → refusal. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 80 words. Persistent constraint: the seal’s buried past now shared but still unspoken.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (jasmine, violet dusk, shell resonance) deepens density until the final image reweights loss as continuity. Causality is internal and coherent—grandmother’s archived voice arrives through prior-set acoustic logic, not coincidence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “her grandmother’s voice would live on, not as ghost but as gift” makes the new rule legible and costly. One scaffold phrase (“as if speaking across the boundary…”) slightly blurs the final beat, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wall dissolves when intention aligns, reweighting truth vs. safety with undeniable social cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each stalactite drip and ink stroke tightens the pattern until the marble forfeits its lie. The “key with no lock” set-up pays off as the rule that intention, not metal, opens the archive. One minor loop—"patient as stalactites drip" is repeated almost verbatim—dulls the final cadence but does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers image-signals (shell, starlight, hum) toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear by word 60; however, escalation is purely cadence-based—no beat narrows options or exacts cost. Closure is lyric but not decisive; the final step is portent without consequence. Hence the lens coheres but the required tightening never lands.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece lands a resonant reconfiguration: the nameless child is on the cusp of reclamation, cost felt in the melting snow globe. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than sharp-edged; because linkage is poetic (“dream-cameos painted a portrait”) rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens but blunting the decisive turn needed for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared by density of net/moon/firefly patterning; closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the whistle callback that reweights “hidden effort” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no teleporting props; causality remains internal-consistency stable. The final image of warm whisk in hand after the cold stone is the exact sentence where cost lands, satisfying the 9+ cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure is present: a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts that myths will orbit an unchanging stillpoint. Causal chain is thin: she’s given the letters, reads them, then acts off-page; the pivot from “cursed relic” to data-storage device is taught, not tested, so escalation feels explanatory rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: each radio fragment tightens her resolve, “because/therefore” chain intact. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—portico cracks, prophet enters, reweighting all prior solitude. Cost is legible: the glass she trusted shatters, foreclosing retreat. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: handing over the box reweights his hoarded sounds into relational currency, cost felt in “gentle reluctance.” Accumulative lens holds—pattern of jarred sounds → pattern of remembered stories—though causality between Elara’s backstory and his insight is off-page inference, not dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens is cleanly causal (“because ice tone warps → therefore she must retune → therefore micro-adjust key”). Orientation settled by word 60; no world-rule cheats. Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: she restores calm yet slumps with visible cost (“exhaustion and relief flooding through her”), foreclosing rest and resetting the cycle. One tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct’s song and lake’s answer crystallize a before/after stance with felt cosmic cost. Accumulative lens holds: each night’s moon-track adds density until the magnetic lattice and lunar river converge, reweighting Kira’s life-work. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no因果 gaps. Persistent constraint—the thousand-year binding—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elena decides to expose Chen, lantern now symbol of illumination not flight, cost framed as career peril. Causal lens holds: drought → body → memory download → decision. However, the inciting supernatural transfer is unmotivated, breaking strict causality; the report-filing coda is summarized, muting the decisive moment’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking heart + unheard blessing reweights grief into quiet continuance; the woman’s imminent realization supplies felt cost. Causal chain intact: second-opinion ethic → delay → inscribed gift → melodic release. One minor scaffold: “He thought of Marcus Webb” paragraph is pure retrospective tell; it tilts stance but stalls present pressure. Still, the ending image pays off the pattern and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: patterned kaleidoscope sessions tighten stakes by density, not because/therefore chains. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—acid sea churns, unheard bell’s cost is undeniable—felt in the workshop’s new frequency. Orientation anchors (who=“cart glider,” where=“floating cathedral,” when=“Tuesday” equiv.) arrive within 90 words and are functional. Micro-turn: first single-shape bell image reorders all prior fractals; persistent constraint (arrow slot) shapes final act.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of 47s and song-echoes tightens until the reveal that Yuki is “distributed.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren chooses to trace deletion rather than restore, reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost. One transition (archive → old subdirectory) is clean; orientation anchored by word 84. No causal break, but final cost is abstract, not felt on the body, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered images (mirrors, crystal faces, orchard-on-ice) accrete until the final image reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mira exits with the fragment warming her pocket, ice softening, option space reconfigured; the cost is the perpetual burden of clearer sight. Orientation is clean by word 80; causality holds via “because the fragment showed, therefore she walks.” One minor elasticity: the ships’ immediate peril is told, not seen, muting the tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: drifting ice, wreck debris, and repeated handling of the parasol tip thicken the stake of “learning endings” until the held-then-released breath closes. Orientation clean by 80 words; single time-step holds. Closure is Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the loosened grip. Persistent constraint (appointment in Switzerland) shapes every beat; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the burnt paper, the vacant station, and the darkening vineyard layers tighten the emotional vise until the closing image of “quiet arrival of acceptance” reweights all prior material. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias pockets the fragment “one final time,” a micro-gesture that forecloses the path back to Mira with unmistakable cost. The amber-to-rose light progression acts as a causal metronome, guiding the tightening without a single causal plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a gentle re-affirmation—“the echo would still be there to answer”—a Charged Poise that reconfigures nothing and exacts no visible price. The causal chain is purely iterative: she walks, tends, remembers, will walk again; no option narrows. The prophet’s absence is backstory weight without present leverage. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence swells but never tightens, so the ending feels like a pause, not a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph shard layers density until the final image reweights the town’s forgotten pain into shared memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren closing her case under golden bars—whose cost is conceptual (she carries the accumulated grief) rather than personal. The piece meets the 600-800 word default, single scene, single POV, and orients by ~120 words; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the stake of “completion.” Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Charged Poise: replacing the crystal reframes four decades of labour as fulfilled, not void. The cost—no more words, ever—lands in the final image of seventeen nameless colours.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the tiny bone-growth sound crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden reweights her longing into “almost peace”—and the cost is the unchanging future she still can’t hold. Orientation is complete by line 5; no因果 breaks, though the middle sags slightly in repeated fog/videotape iterations.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the spinning hand’s persistence is the tightening agent, reweighting the stake from “stop time” to “let motion move through me.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—camera clicks preserve motion without arresting it, crystallizing the new stance. Cost is legible: forty years of waiting are conceded irretrievably. Causality holds; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared stillness reconfigures both women’s remaining options under the Accumulative lens. The vinyl crescent’s final gleam makes the conceptual cost—beauty after fracture—undeniable. Causality holds: Elara’s blood-work news propels every subsequent kindness; no off-stage cheats. One micro-transition (clinic → hospice) is legible; orientation anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: find key → trace loops → close seven circles → shadow re-appears; the Bend backstory is anchored to present stimuli and the final image delivers a Conceptual Repricing (light folded back upon itself) with visible cost (key hot, shadow restored). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the tooth’s glow reweights meaning rather than triggering causal turns. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—constellation pattern charges the prior maternal fracture with undeniable conceptual cost. One ellipsis could be tighter, but closure is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto becomes a living constellation, the price being permanent earthbound service. Causality holds—gem-polishing skills earned in exile convert loss into shared luminescence—though the hinge turn (“she understood immediately”) is narrated, not dramatized. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the final image reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moss/water patterns gradually reweight the母女 stakes until the closing Charged Poise (“learning that sometimes the most quietly proactive thing… is simply stay”). Orientation is clean by line 3; causality is not the engine, yet the final crystallization is legible and carries felt cost. The single soft spot: the midpoint hospital flashback is a 100-word reflective block with no present-tense pivot—just enough to keep this out of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist thickens, ghosts accrue, shell recurs, and the final cadence shifts to readiness. Closure lands as Charged Poise (“she was ready to write”) with conceptual cost—acknowledgment of abandoned hope—but the cost is muffled because no new constraint or forfeiture is shown. Orientation is clear by 120 wds; no causality break, yet escalation is more texture than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure earns its resonance: a Charged Poise as the moonvine bursts into luminous life, re-weighting heritage and possibility with undeniable felt cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer thickens until the dawn alignment ruptures into new life. Orientation is clear by line 4 and anchors every 10–15 sentences; no causality breaks. Slight withholding—the song’s mechanism is asserted not tested—nudges it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing spiral reweights the discarded objects and the orchard itself, with felt cost in the cold blue flame consuming the last flash-paper. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density increases until cadence shift at the seal. Orientation is taught early (“withered orchard,” “crater floor,” “subarctic twilight”) so no penalty. Persistent constraint—finite flash-paper and the cold—shapes every move; final image crystallizes meaning without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the timer’s purpose is rewritten from measuring time to storing wonder, cost felt in “seasons, not hours.” Accumulative lens holds throughout—each mirrored light pass deposits new pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint (repair will take seasons) shapes future tactics, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added strand layers silence and stone until the closing Charged Poise reweights the premise—she becomes the pattern itself. Orientation is swift; the single scene tightens once when calcification reaches her breathing. Cost is legible in the line “she did not resist,” but the causality of the grotto’s bargain is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass-eyed lion crystallizes the paradox that containment ≠ imprisonment. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of rain, shavings, kettle whistle—each recurrence re-weighting absence. Cost is legible in the cold kettle and the fading autumn light; she forfeits the daily ritual of tea for the eternal one of carving. Causality is interior and recursive rather than forward-driving, but the pattern is taught early and pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: camera stills, lagoon holds, ghost watches—options reweighted without tidy repair. Accumulative lens holds: each collected fragment layers sediment into the final stasis. Orientation is taught early via physics-defying lagoon, waiving anchor penalty. One causality hiccup: camera suddenly “catches” all stories at once—slight teleport, but the image crystallizes the rule-shift rather than breaks it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant on her desk reweights the terminal’s future from commerce to community, with “stubborn persistence toward renewal” as felt cost. Causal chain is thin—approval happens off-scene—but the redirected-flow plan is tightly set up and pays off in the final image. Orientation is clean by 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the aquifer angle is calculated, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the first sustained tick reweights the premise—time is no longer frozen grief but living song. Causality is internal and accumulative; each sensory echo (petrichor, crystal whispers) tightens the emotional vice until the key-turn releases it. Orientation is secured by word ~90 with “valley…sunrise came late.” No lens ambiguity; the pattern of accumulating texture holds to the final image. The cost is palpable: the grandfather’s silence ends, the narrator’s stewardship ends.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s quiet persistence reweights time itself as evidence, making the hidden canal undeniable. Causal linkage holds—each beat (purchase, twilight reading, steering) flows logically because she pursues the erased waterway. Orientation is crisp within the first 60 words; no penalty. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural) yet keeping the stakes cerebral; a more visceral price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope-and-glass reading crystallizes his vocation, foreclosing idle curiosity. Causality is Accumulative: fog, snow, and knot-pattern recognition tighten the mood until the lens flips from mystery to mandate. Cost is conceptual—he now carries the ancestral burden—but the beat is one quiet moment; a sharper physical or social price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each imagistic tile—falling leaf, dry fountain, red thread—adds density until the final “first stroke of the map” reweights the premise; the traveler’s lateness becomes an earned stasis with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying closure with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s golden instructions reprice the mission from sabotage to synthesis, cost is the foreclosed path of easy tyrannicide. Causal chain holds—journey → chamber → decode → new purpose—though the “assemble” beat is retrospective summary rather than on-page effort. One transition (journey to chamber) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 80. Meets lens test (Causal) without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: black sand → obsidian mirror → molten gold is the taught pattern that reweights the stake at the end. One continuous lagoon scene, 740 words; orientation anchored by line 4. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon’s surface flips darkness into fire-light, crystallizing her grafted vocation with the felt cost of perpetual exposure to flame-smell. Persistent constraint—sand grains clinging to boots—will keep marking her return, a physical price that shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb-fountain shard adds density until the final release reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (memories freed, Mira’s stance recalibrated) with conceptual cost legible in the dimming glow. One minor loop: “patience of starlight” image repeats without intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—cyclical garden, generational gear—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s autonomous tick reweights the “share light without fire” mission into a colder, self-propagating illumination. Cost is legible in the final sonar ping that no longer returns to Vael alone, implying custodial displacement. One micro-turn (gear wakes) tightens the pattern; nocausality breaks, though the orientation of time (“seven cycles of breath”) remains poetic rather than chronometric, waived because it serves the lyric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s last whisper reweights stone from monument to way-station, costing her the safety of rational disbelief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every imagistic loop (glass, migration, ribbon) thickens until the cadence shift at “this is enough” crystallizes new rules for her craft. Cost is legible in the final line—“patient and eternal”—where eternity is now a negotiated burden, not a promise.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum restarts, Marcus descends, carrying rake and redistributed guilt—cost felt in “one careful footfall at a time.” Causal lens holds: because he keeps showing up, therefore the pause can reweight his load; no retroactive patches. Orientation anchored by sentence 4 (who, ridge, equinox dusk); no penalty. One reflective block (~22%) stays anchored to present stimuli and alters stance via micro-adjustments; BRR exception met. Persistent constraint—the unforgiven daughter beneath the tower—shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reweights the gardener’s caretaking vocation with the sovereign’s plea for posthumous witness, and the cost is the burden of now carrying that secret. Causality is thin—no prior beat makes the gardener uniquely able or obliged to answer the question—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the descent, cobalt light, and unraveling border deepen mood until the revelation crystallizes. Orientation is clear by word 60; the single transition (climb down / climb up) is legible and framed as continuous scene shards.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill descending encodes the conceptual cost of mapping ignorance itself. Causal chain holds—feather → constraint → predictive model → poised act—without teleport or amnesia. One shard, one POV, orientation anchored by 120 words; the reflective block (~30%) is interleaved with present stimuli and micro-choices, satisfying BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the instant she sings, the dust stirs and the mist listens, reweighting the world as a place where stories can still sprout. The “story famine” rule stays intact, no soft reset. Under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens, the density intensifies as song, dust, and fog converge; one clear tightening suffices. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, but the final image (“the dust in the corners began to stir with something that might have been anticipation”) makes the cost legible. Early orientation passes—Mira, ember alcove, candlelight within 30 words, no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative lens is declared early (transform by burning) and tightens through each added layer of ash until the final Charged Poise: gallery dark, mask glowing, reader left holding unanswerable questions with her. Causality is interior but legible—porcelain destroyed because stories kept shifting; ash poured because eyes could never be drawn; departure chosen because understanding is accepted as fragmentary. Cost is unmistakable in the last lines: “weight of everything she would never fully understand.”

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reweights the meaning of the cog and sediment work—future readers will know someone resisted the lie; the cost is the narrator’s lifetime and solitude. Causal chain holds: each artifact recovered tightens his conviction that official history is false, therefore he must keep working even if he dies unknown. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with place, time (post-plague), and POV. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silt and artifacts builds until the final reconfiguration. No slips touch closure; minor tightening could compress one reflective repetition to reach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Eleanor’s decades-long subtraction of inner noise crystallizes in the final image of the worn flower, cost visible in years of silence she can’t reclaim. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of subtractive listening tightens until the hush itself becomes the decisive chord. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena dissolves the seed and claims stewardship of the ruin-to-kitchen, a visible conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: each pruning cut re-weights memory and stakes, culminating in the crystallized final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint—she now carries irreversible generational taste-knowledge—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the riddle read aloud re-weights the entire premise, making wonder the new grid-fuel while the cost—Elara must now preach what she used to merely record—lands in the final image of drones stirring. Causal chain is clean: blackout → Mira arrives → matchbox riddle → tower reading → grid flickers. Orientation anchors by line 3, and the drone-beehive rule set stays consistent. Only nit: “the revelation came not as a sudden flash but as a slow dawn” tells the turn instead of letting the humming air dramatize it, a minor softening just outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—house-as-memory is legible and reweighted—but cost is only asserted, not dramatized on her body, choices, or forfeited option. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; however, single-scene default is strained by ~120-word delay before spatial anchor (harbor road) and mild loop in “she understands finally” restatement. Orientation debt is mild but present.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the statue renounces guardianship for witnessing, ampoule fades in palm, cost legible. Accumulative lens holds—images layer until meaning reweights—but causal tether is light; the diver encounter is consequence, not catalyst, so tightening is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dice throw thickens pattern density until the dismissed formula reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—stairs, imprisonment, method all land by word 50. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “boundless confinement” flips to “infinite exploration” with conceptual cost legible in the final sentence. No causal break, no scaffold loops; only the non-appearance of a tangible price prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moon-touched brush → nightly copying → sudden fluent inscription. One tightening beat at 2 a.m. when daydream sharpens into legible vision; causality intact. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—paintings left for strangers crystallize her stance with visible cost (“good kind of tired”). Orientation anchors arrive by line 5; no penalty. Minor slip: “roused” declared rather than dramatized in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lens-to-bread-to-waterfall chain supplies a clean Accumulative/Textural arc: each motif re-weights survival into transmission. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren carrying the B-loaf toward the roar—so the cost (exposure of the hidden city) is palpable even though the physical act is only one step.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse dissolves, hunger stone submerges, Iris exits past-tense reality—cost is the world itself. Causal chain holds: death-vision → exile → yoyo study → counter-spin → unmaking. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3), no teleporting props. The only drag is a single causality shorthand: “she had determined” compresses the pivotal insight that could have tightened escalation on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph reverts to “beautifully hers,” the clasp warms, and the carnival releases her—cost is the relinquishing of the dictionary and the advisor’s voice. Causal lattice holds: because she voices her self-destruction, fear’s mirror-grip breaks. Orientation secured by word 80. One transition (gate → funhouse interior) is clean. Persistent price: she drives away still carrying the reservoir memory; no omniscient patch.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final smile accepts the endless, costly labor of translation; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each dub strike deepens density until the night-time cadence reweights the stake. Causality holds; no orientation debt; the price is felt in the pulsing arm that must keep playing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whistle-act re-animates the shell, tightening stakes under Accumulative lens; cost is felt—the city may wake or collapse. Orientation is clear by word 80; one causal tightening is sufficient. The dot-pattern link is the only hinge that could be stronger, but it does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letter lifted into "fading light" re-weights every prior myth and carries the town’s future shame in one image—cost is legible. Causality is accumulative/textural: ivy, station, petal, and letter layer until the myth cracks; the lens holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the decisive act (publish) is off-stage future, so the ending poise is strong but not irrevocable—hence not an 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren stands on the darkening shore, tide erasing her exit, inkweight in coat reconfiguring her life’s work. Causal chain holds: shoreline retreat → pavilion exposed → artifact found → method invented (notes in cracks) → identity surrendered. “Permission” is the conceptual cost—she now bears witness instead of merely mapping, a shift legible in the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative lens is declared early (“truth revealed itself through accumulation”) and holds: blackout → candlelit pattern recognition → hidden manuscript → crystallized resolve, each layer tightening density rather than causal chain. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes with the felt cost of inheriting a clandestine, dangerous vocation, sealed by the stamp’s legacy and the library’s “reclaimed stillness.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished gem and folded crane thickens the pattern until the lantern replays the lost shadow, reweighting grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—she begins the next crane with no illusion of recovery—cost felt in the eternal twilight that keeps glowing. One causality hiccup: the basilica commission is dropped without on-page consequence, a minor loose linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of returned images (geode, cooling LEDs, pools of potential) tightens to Charged Poise ending—“hold it up to the light and watch it scatter”—with visible conceptual cost (endless search accepted). Causality intact; drone strike + survival anchor by 120 words. No meaningful pressure turn inside present scene, only deepening, sufficient for ≤800-word lyric design. Closure beat is legible and untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the stellar press reweights belonging from puzzle to presence, cost visible in the “brilliant dimness” that embraces her. Causal linkage holds—chip→mechanism→map→recognition—without convenient leaps. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“obsidian floor”), transitions clean, one deepening beat suffices for 700-word scope. Persistent constraint: the sealed station and the need for the chip keep pressure taut.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the watch hand reweights every prior fabrication with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The driftwood pattern is taught early and returns in a single, resonant image; causality holds, and the withheld truth is survived, not erased, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the simultaneous drop reweights the entire inherited conflict under the Accumulative/Textural lens—cadence shift from tactile ritual to acoustic absence. Orientation is clean within 120 words: parapet, mist, neutral ground, adversary’s granddaughter. Causality is interior and lyrical rather than event-based, but the pattern of mirrored brass → mirrored release is taught early and paid off. Cost is felt in the hush that follows the two small sounds; the moon’s emergence visually confirms the reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the current yanks her seaward and she laughs, a Charged Poise that reweights every prior regret into forward motion. Causality is causal-lens solid—each pole passed is a because/therefore step that progressively collapses her option to quit—so the final “one pole at a time” crystallizes the new rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is locked before the 120-word mark (Mussel Point, cedar poles, choppy tide), and the compass is never teleported; it warms against her skin exactly when the emotional temperature rises. The off-page breakup is the single soft stitch, but since it does not motivate the final decision (the kayak already launched), the closure unit itself is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empathic spark lands with conceptual cost—the old guilt is gone but the need to choose a future self is now inescapable. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each glowing corridor adds density until the traveler’s sentence crystallizes the stake. Orientation is swift; the baseball and clippings anchor genre rules early, so the underground reveal feels inevitable, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lysara’s “I would become the bridge” crystallizes the new state and its cost—permanent hybridity—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Scent-memory linkage is taught early and paid off in the final image (“spices continued their fragrant work”), so the pattern holds. One causality seam: the fortune’s prophecy never concretely narrows options; it merely echoes. Nevertheless, the ending beat reweights every prior sensory thread, satisfying the cost test with felt rather than plot currency.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the saucer-cut delivers Conceptual Repricing—time cannot be reclaimed, only released—cost is the literal blood mingling with ancestral ink. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; moonlit images stack until the crack reframes the stake. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). One soft spot: the cards’ promise is referenced, never shown, a mild ellipsis that luckily doesn’t rupture causality because the real engine is her obsessive ritual, not spell mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: stitching ancestral grief into a literal gateway reweights “compassion” from relic to engine. Causal chain holds: tear→photograph shimmer→thread→dimension bloom; each beat tightens the one path available to a pacifist. Time and place anchor within 120 words; “starless void” and “gravity pools” fix spatial rules. Cost is legible—she pays with permanent exile from human context and the bodily lift that makes her untethered forever.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the eclipse apex plus released bugs create a Charged Poise—Mara stands in earned stasis, having foreclosed wealth and comfort, now re-centered as conduit of light. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of collected light → release → recognition that “transformation is…a continuous becoming.” Orientation is swift (black-sand beach, volcano's breath within 120 words) and causality-free design holds. Cost is felt in the final image (“destitute and luminous”), satisfying the 9- gate even without a causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cradle-of-sparks network is now active, reweighting the regime’s control; cost is conceptual (regime vulnerability) rather than personal, acceptable under CR. Causal chain is thin—blackout → quill resonance → parchment → decision—but each step is legible under a Hybrid lens; the missing beat is any on-page obstacle or risk that tightens options before the final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the instant Mira joins the pattern, frictionless physics is not restored but transcended—cost is the irretrievable star dust and the lifelongcurse now bearable. Causal chain (promise → Spiral → joining pattern) holds; no teleporting props. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and the deliberate disorientation (“everything began to slip”) is later paid off by the final image of spreading dawn. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density tightens via recurring “pattern” imagery until meaning reweights at the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vigil ends not by external permission but by her reclaiming motion, visible in the mist-written verses. Causal chain holds—storm → mask-slip → re-cognition → writing—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-transition (pocket → timetable → envelope) could be cleaner, but orientation is anchored by 120 words and closure recharges the timer/timetable tandem.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s shifting shadows reweight the entire dispute from proof to process, with the younger scholar’s lowered weapon as on-page cost. Causal lens holds—Varn redirects momentum because he earlier learned to convert limitation to advantage. Orientation is anchored by 120 words via glass atrium, brook, mechanical arm. One tightening beat suffices; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library, poems, and women are "waiting for the next reader," a crystallized stance with felt social cost—beauty forced inside a cage of iron and stars, work unfinished. Causal chain holds: poem-offer causes shared moment causes the unfinished cathedral image; no off-stage resolution. Orientation clean by paragraph 2; single transition to moon-rise is legible. Accumulation lens chosen—density of imagery and cadence tighten once as poems migrate into books—so the Required CR still satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cloud-piano performance crystallizes options—he keeps grieving yet keeps playing—cost felt in the rising tide that will eventually wash him back to the station. Causal lattice holds: every beat is because/therefore anchored to the flicker coordinates and the frozen clock. One slight wobble: the reel mechanics are revealed only at the roof moment, so the membrane rule feels conveniently discovered rather than foreshadowed. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the arbor threshold is legible under hybrid lens (causal + accumulative image).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (hue of moths, scent of thyme, bloom-flower’s spiral) thickens the texture until the seed-dream reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—knowledge scatters like seeds, a conceptual cost that forecloses archival control. Orientation is clean by line 5; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern. Monsoon deadline provides tightening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer and object reweights the stake of unspoken apology. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—compass pointing inward, bonsai snip—charged poise with felt cost. Orientation anchored by word 50; no drift. One pattern break: lace pattern’s shifting message intensifies regret without causal turn, sufficient for sub-800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where meaning accrues through layered images of dust, decay, and pattern. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Mira reweights stellar violence against gentle entropy, with cost legible in her relinquishment of dramatic framing (“the universe had delivered her a greenhouse full of small, undramatic deaths”). The three-day return beat deepens the pattern without breaking causality, and the final image—dust dispersed yet internally indelible—carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: truth survives fire, and victim becomes pursuer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—frost patterns, ledger, and memory coalesce into revelation. Cost is legible in lost art, solitude, and calcified grief now loosening. The scorched ledger’s survival and Mira’s reorientation toward justice crystallize a Charged Poise with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is established early and held through closure: emotional residue accrues like sediment, culminating in the performance hall’s layered warmth. The orientation is precise by line 30 (who: Elara; where: winterglass conservatory; when: post-Quieting). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—Elara redefines “music” as felt architecture—with tangible cost (abandoning sound-recovery for translation). The persistent constraint of silence shapes every tactic and crystallizes in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aldric’s shift from fatigue to readiness is crystallized in the final image of him waiting with fresh coffee, holding the restored lens. Cost is legible—the cold coffee, the vanished package, the years of solitude now exchanged for ongoing duty. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via sensory density (salt-smelling sand, underwater library) and cadence shifts that reweight his stake in giving rest. Orientation is clear by line 30; disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through repeated acts of quiet resistance until the bell’s ring becomes a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure is earned: the community’s emergence and spontaneous mentorship enact Mira’s plan, with visible cost in exhaustion, scarcity, and sanctioned isolation. The arbor scene reweights prior silence into collective declaration, satisfying Conceptual Repricing with social cost. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mei’s act transforms unused love into released luminescence, with cost legible in her altered breath and the viaduct’s exhalation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via wisteria, fireflies, tear warmth, and breathing shifts until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. Cost is felt: she endures profound grief to enable release, foreclosing passive witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elara’s resolve to design a new maze crystallizes options without physical action, yet the cost—carrying the burden of temporal stewardship—is legible in the trembling garden’s response. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered revelations about photographs, geometry, and the halo. Orientation is immediate (“Elara knelt among the lupines…”), and causality flows via discovery, not coincidence. The final image reweights all prior motifs with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira emerges not as prisoner but keeper of futures, with the cost of delayed action and continued disguise legible in her awkward descent and strategic restraint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered sensory motifs (dust motes, piano keys, synthetic feathers) that culminate in a reconfigured stance. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality is maintained through consistent rules (biometric sigil, key logic). The wall’s fall isn’t a deus ex machina but a pressure valve that tightens her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—trust’s dissolution is not a crash but a symphony of silences. The ending crystallizes this as Charged Poise: Elara accepts she may never heal others, yet continues, cost legible in “ten years left” and the “battered marvel” of persistence. Orientation is immediate (“pressed the resonator against her temple”), and the pattern of absence-as-presence pays off without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the man’s “luminous disbelief” crystallizes a reconfiguration of self-perception, with visible cost in his lifted heaviness and Mira’s spent moonbeams. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through floral codes, light shifts, and camera ritual until the portrait becomes a CR of paths untraveled. Orientation is immediate (“emerald station,” “golden-hour theft”), and causality flows through sensory accumulation, not plot mechanics. The ending image reweights the entire premise without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the glassblower completes a vessel that embodies “safe zones for inquiry,” mirroring his own thawing heart. The cost is legible—the scars on both bookmark and glass signify survival through breakage, not restoration. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: melting ice, softening glass, and emotional un-freezing layer into a cadence shift that reweights the central stake. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits the length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Maya’s discovery of the seashell triggers her flight to the library, which enables the confrontation with Daniel and the decoding of the cast—each beat follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is immediate (who: Maya; where: abandoned library; when: three hours after revelation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she stands with the cast as shield, reconfiguring fear into agency, with felt cost in her trembling yet steady voice. The persistent constraint—her claustrophobia—shapes tactics throughout and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the oracle completes her map and dies at peace, foreclosing her life with visible cost (exhaustion, isolation, fading light). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via storm, dying star, flaking booklet—and culminates in a Charged Poise where silence speaks. Cost is legible in “the last testament of a woman who had given her life.” Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the robot accepts the flow of perception as selfhood, crystallizing its stance amid twilight. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via layered memories, cadence shifts with the music’s complexity, and the ice violin’s impossible presence reweights reality. Cost is legible in the final image: rebirth entails surrendering the illusion of continuous identity. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the registrar’s shift from passive waiting to active drawing crystallizes a new stance, with visible cost (months of solitude, the weight of failed words). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint—pattern of symbolic exchange taught early, intensified by Mira’s arrival, culminating in the midnight visitor.

    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures in her role, foreclosing intervention while affirming the garden’s autonomy, with cost legible in the weight of cracked marbles and the villagers’ misdirected hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies via density of reflection and ritual, culminating in the villager’s arrival that crystallizes her stance. Orientation anchors immediately (“Elara walked the garden maze each morning…”), and causality flows through consistent character logic. The mended deception functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure: patterned sensory detail (amber light, membrane unfurling, hum of the nexus) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—time moves sideways. The final image crystallizes this with undeniable cost: Kira’s reconfiguration from mechanic to epochal witness, foreclosing anonymity. Orientation is anchored within 60 words. The only flaw: the climax leans slightly on declaration (“You were correct”) rather than pure dramatization, softening the causal punch just enough to prevent a 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena endures the flood to complete Marco’s score, then departs, foreclosing escape earlier but accepting emotional resolution now.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias watches arrivals he set in motion but no longer directs, the lighthouse beam sweeping while “leaving everything else in familiar shadow”—a resonant reconfiguration that crystallizes his shift from controller to conduit. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern intensification (fortunes → real-world consequences → physical arrivals) culminating in a cadence shift at dusk. Cost is legible: he foregoes returning to espionage, accepting isolation even as connection arrives. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality flows through poetic linkage, not mechanical plot.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered chant, deepening silence, and intensifying color until the final image crystallizes meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: Matthias enters the threshold with the palette glowing, options legible (interrogate vs. exorcise), stakes reconfigured (possession as contract, not invasion), and cost felt (the child’s stalled agony, the priest’s isolation). The pocket watch (11:47) anchors time early; the dimensional anchor grounds space; orientation is clear by line 30. The “muffled clarity” before revelation is earned through rhythmic and sensory accumulation, not causality—but that’s appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final fortune reweights silence from absence to performance, charging the premise with emotional cost—Elira’s vanishing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure escalates via sensory layering and memory mapping, not causality, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (feather, fireflies, luminescence) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: belonging is not solvable but shareable. Orientation is immediate (“Marek pressed the burnished feather against the glass”), and the closure—a Charged Poise as Marek waits amid rising fireflies—carries conceptual cost: the facility will flood, his archive addition is ephemeral, yet kinship is affirmed. The drive lens holds coherently from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the father’s tearful acceptance reconfigures absence into continuation, with emotional cost legible in “tears fell freely.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—images accrue like sediment, culminating in a crystallized insight. The crater glass’s transliteration process drives causality without contrivance, and the “curtain across a window” gap is a brilliant metaphor for emotional erasure. Cost is felt, not explained: peace arrives as open-ended burden, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (bishop, billiard balls, tide) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Marek pockets the bishop as the next act begins, his “analyst’s smile” revealing a stance that accepts the cycle—serenading monotony without escape. The cost is conceptual: his art requires eternal recurrence, never resolution. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30, and the tidal rhythm functions as both setting and structural metronome.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tide dancer’s smile reconfigures exile as arrival, with conceptual cost (surrendered past, irreversible inscription). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds through sensory density, cadence shifts, and patterned imagery (tides, gaps, light/shadow), culminating in the verse’s inscription. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality is motivated by consistent internal logic. The final image (“tide itself coming home”) makes the cost undeniable without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the glazier returns to work not changed, but recentered, carrying the pond’s lesson into the day’s demands. The cost is legible—the solitude of being “strange,” the labor of seeing what others overlook—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout. The structure moves from stillness to motion via the stone’s throw, and the final image reconfigures the ordinary harbor as newly readable, fulfilling the story’s promise without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s final act—closing the box and preparing to mentor—crystallizes her stance without resolving grief, making the cost of her survival legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: moonlight, ash, porcelain, and stars layer into a resonant pattern that reweights innocence as sacrifice. The ridge path anchors orientation early, and every reflective beat ties to present action (e.g., opening the box to speak). Cost is undeniable in the crazed mirror and the line “to transform her burning into someone else's light.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs—trial balloons, the grotto, the altitude gauge—but fails to deliver a true Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The ending reiterates Elara’s purpose without altering it or revealing a new constraint; the “serene upheaval” remains conceptual, not dramatized. While the closure image is poetic, it lacks the decisive tightening or cadence shift required to reweight the dominant stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies through layered sensory detail and deepening resonance, culminating in Charged Poise—Mira sketching as the walls “dream aloud.” Cost is legible in the cold corridors, breath clouding, and the weight of unremembered names. Orientation anchors (“university before the floods,” “Mira,” “eastern wing”) are clear by line 30. The closure reconfigures legacy from burden to thread, with conceptual cost borne in solitude now transformed into shared witness.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory layering and rhythmic cadence until the “hush before bells” crystallizes into Charged Poise: mirrors reconfigured, possibilities seeded, and Aria’s departure leaving altered perception in her wake. Closure is resonant and on-page—the final image of awakened mirrors never seeing the world the same way again delivers Conceptual Repricing with social cost (hope made visible in class-rigid shards). The prism parapet, rain, and lullaby cohere as pressure intensifies, and the borrowed heartbeat’s slowing marks tangible consequence. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, ritual repetition, and the celestial clock, culminating in a Charged Poise closure—Lord Varen and Duchess Sera’s lingering handshake reconfigures possibility without false resolution. Cost is unmistakable: Maren admits peace doesn’t honor the dead but saves the living from becoming them, and the terrace holds centuries of failed treaties. The structure is a single, continuous scene with flawless orientation (who, where, when anchored by line 3), and the tightening—from individual grief to shared gesture—is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg left alone on the salt flat crystallizes her irreversible choice, with conceptual cost (ethical transgression, personal fracture) legible in the final image. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered revelation of her engineered drought, satellite planning, and backstory—but culminates in a decisive reconfiguration of hope vs. hubris. Orientation is immediate (“salt flat,” “her boots”), and causality holds: every prior act converges on the release. The thunder’s return underscores time’s pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery and ritualized action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist’s crystallized defiance as dawn breaks. Cost is legible in the “fraying” lullaby and her irreversible awakening; the frozen fountain and prisms function as persistent constraints shaping her tactics. Orientation is immediate (“silver courtyard under snow”), and the closure image—rainbows dancing as she leaves no mark—reweights all prior motifs with undeniable conceptual cost: beauty reclaimed as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines ethical storytelling not by completing a narrative but by refusing completion. The meteor hush breaking overhead coincides with his realization, charging the final image with cosmic witness. Cost is legible in the abandoned story stick—a tool of conquest now repurposed as monument. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by patterned sensory density and cadence shift at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered motifs (moth wing, knots, grotto), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara’s act of rebuilding becomes the honoring itself. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the monarch may be the last, the grotto may vanish—and the final image reweights all prior labor as necessary regardless of outcome. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. The gust-driven crisis tightens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Yara’s return to the world is crystallized by the rope’s hum, making remembrance a living act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through patterned recurrence (rope, card, aurora) that reweights silence into memory. Cost is legible: her joints ache, the ice remains, but she chooses burden over forgetting. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive reframed as answers to lost questions, reweighting the entire quest with poignant cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the storm, vine-draped decay, and fading ink coalesce into a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t linear but patterned, with dream logic paying off precisely at climax. The only flaw: “Then she transcended” risks abstraction, but the preceding glow and heartbeat sync ground it just enough.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the palace’s prosperity is revealed as contingent on forgotten ritual, not political stability. Cost is legible in Maruk’s solitary vigil and the implied burden of continuity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through schematics, tile, stars, and twilight until the final harmonic resonance. Orientation is immediate (“astronomer Maruk,” “palace,” “between regimes”) and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden solidifies, the pin reappears, and the music plays—not through magic but grace redistributed via emotional release. The causal chain is tight: broken pin → lost melody → Mira’s conviction → Kael’s cellular memory → restitution. Orientation is deliberately disorienting early (“walls breathed with borrowed time”) but pays off at closure when shifting stops, proving functional. Cost is legible in Kael’s admission of years-long resentment—a psychological price that enables the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror doesn’t reflect Mira but reveals the astronomer’s dream, reweighting the premise that reflection can dissolve boundaries between dreamed and real. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (fog, thresholds, glass) until the final lattice of frost crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible: Mira forgoes self-recognition to serve another’s lost vision, and the orchard’s centuries-long endurance mirrors her own sacrifice. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s repaired statue and the daughter’s arrival crystallize a new stance—accepting imperfection and interdependence—with clear emotional cost (lost time, fractured trust). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (rotting pears, quartz shards, ivy) builds toward a cadence shift at twilight that reweights “deciduous vows.” Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is motivated by character flaw, not convenience. The only hairline slip: the daughter’s entrance borders on convenient timing, though it’s foreshadowed by Mira’s persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory and conceptual density until the cameo’s activation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the image reweights the entire premise of inheritance as cyclical, self-originating knowledge. Cost is legible—the “brightened disquiet” implies irreversible awareness. The pattern is taught early (dreams → key → document), and the final image crystallizes stakes with undeniable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s purpose is redefined not as hoarding lost knowledge but as protecting humanity from its own fear, crystallized in the “single, crystalline note of recognition.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered images (flowers, empty shelves, symphony) until density breaks into insight. Cost is legible: Elara accepts that recovery requires surrender, not retrieval. The nautilus chamber discovery functions as the pivotal deepening, and the mountain’s sigh signals irreversible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with fog, ship, and card layering toward a Charged Poise closure: Mira is “both trapped... and impossibly free.” The fog thinning as memories alter provides a decisive cadence shift that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image—she sacrifices certainty for hope—but the causal link between the card’s glow and the garden remains implied, not dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene holds tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered objects (rope, seal, fables) until the final reconfiguration crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the door appears not by magic but by clarity, and the cost is conceptual—historical erasure made visible. The rope’s encoded logic and the seal’s diplomatic cipher cohere causally, and the “fables of absence” payoff feels earned. One minor flaw: the transition from archival discovery to physical act is slightly compressed, softening the escalation’s grit.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through resonant imagery until the spiral crack triggers a pattern break that reweights silence as sanctuary. Orientation is immediate (“Mira pressed her palm…”), and closure lands as Earned Stasis: she secures refuge but bears the cost of being the sole carrier of hope. The echo chamber stone’s reactivation provides causal continuity, and the bloom’s formation is legible as a physics-driven null point, not magic. Cost is visible in her trembling relief and deferred return to survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the pavilion’s hum, amber glass, and star paths forming a resonant pattern that intensifies toward closure. The discovery of the prism functions as a decisive deepening that reweights the dominant stake: not just maintaining the beacon, but reigniting communal meaning. Cost is legible in the “thistle-blown hope” and the implied risk of ascent, though physical or social consequence remains oblique. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of coincidence as cosmic message—lands with poetic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final lines reweight the entire premise by asserting that what endures is “presence,” not names or achievements—a shift charged with quiet cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held throughout; the storm’s intensification and shadow-reading pattern deepen pressure without causal breaks. Orientation is immediate and vivid, and the crystalline forecourt’s rules are learned through action. The only hairline flaw: the “unfamiliar angle” monument arrives without prior signal, slightly weakening setup-payoff symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (chant, rag knot, mosaic) until the fire spiral crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky isn’t restored, but human agency reweights cosmic absence into participatory hope. Cost is legible in Mira’s isolation and the villagers’ initial silence—her light risks futility, yet she acts. The mosaic note functions as a taught pattern, not a deus ex machina, and the ending’s “beginning of stars deciding to wake up” reconfigures darkness as dormancy, not void.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (tide, stars, cicada) until the final Charged Poise: Mira’s offering and the sister’s softened reply. Cost is legible in the “three years of silence” and the tension in both women’s bodies—forgiveness isn’t granted but tentatively reached for. Orientation is clear by line 30; the grotto, stars, and tidal pools anchor time and place without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure: silence accrues density until it becomes a flavor she can carry. Orientation is immediate (“Mira pressed her palm… clouds beneath her feet”), and the hour-long gravity inversion functions as both clock and crucible. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—limitation redefined as protection from fear, not the world—with cost legible in her decision to return to the bunker yet carry the hush. The final image crystallizes a Charged Poise: she’ll build a trellis, not a bunker, foreclosing her father’s logic with quiet resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered silence, light, and sound until the storm glass clarifies—a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence transforms from absence to comfort. Orientation is immediate: “Maren had guided vessels through the prism terrace for eleven years” anchors who, where, and when by line 3. The closure lands with conceptual cost: the boy gains unconscious warmth, Maren bears unseen labor, and the storm glass’s crystalline clarity signals earned stasis. Every beat tightens the thematic weave without causal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elara ascends not as ruler but custodian, reconfiguring the throne’s meaning with clear conceptual cost—she surrenders scholarly detachment for guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered murals, color shifts, and the ruby’s pulse, culminating in a resonant reweighting of the Unclaimed Throne. Dawn’s approach tightens pressure without rushing, honoring the “haste is enemy” rule. Every beat links via sensory and symbolic accumulation, not causality, yet the final image crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sanctuary’s “loaded emptiness” is reweighted as a tomb, and thresholds are reframed as living boundaries requiring tending, not destruction. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and recurring motifs (ash, hands, breath), culminating in the starlit departure. Cost is legible in the final image: she carries the ring into a world that “had been waiting,” implying vulnerability as price. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative/Textural in buildup (glitching texts, bioluminescent pressure), Causal in climax (bolt’s activation demands Maya’s presence as translator). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: broken promises can yield diamonds if witnessed with full awareness of their cost. The “third junction” convergence delivers a Decisive Change in understanding, not action, and the cost—three years of psychological ruin—is legible in every hesitant step. Orientation is masterfully handled: disorientation (flickering text) serves the closure’s dimensional fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and symbolic layering until the gramophone’s activation triggers a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty didn’t end with death but with a hidden choice. The closure is resonant—the veil-thin evening, the standing waves, the unfinished sentence—all cohere into a Charged Poise where Elara now holds unbearable knowledge. Cost is legible: she must carry a truth that rewrites her identity, foreclosing her constructed life of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Aldric reweights “possibility” as sacred, not lost, and carries its weight into the world. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the greenhouse’s phosphorescent stillness builds density until the vow triggers dispersal. Cost is legible: the orchard vanishes, but he gains internalized purpose. Anchors are clear by line 30; disorientation is functional, not flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the button reweights the entire archival project as an act of sacred witness, not bureaucratic recordkeeping. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via layered reflections on loss, systems, and memory, culminating in a charged final image. Cost is legible in Mara’s quiet endurance and the weight of unrecorded histories. Orientation is immediate and precise; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s discovery reweights “truth” from fragile secret to distributable weapon, with cost legible in Mira’s irreversible shift from preserver to teacher. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds through layered images (puddles, lagoon, key) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (“eleven years being invisible”), and causality flows via pressure-driven choices, not coincidence. The final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the saxophonist endures, foreclosing the prophecy’s escape with visible cost (“bought them another day, perhaps another century”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through dewdrop rhythm, prismatic light, and prophetic whispers until the final sustained note seals the void. Cost is legible in the trembling pool, swirling mist, and “eerie nostalgia” of the descent. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory detail and ritual until the Hush crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Seraphina’s perspective expands, and the prophecy becomes present—cost visible in her irreversible shift and the weight of responsibility. The moonstone speck and forgotten seed pay off causally, and the ending reweights every prior action. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the lens holds tightly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory and emotional density builds toward a Charged Poise at the stairwell’s threshold, where descent becomes inevitable. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Maren; where: ruins beyond headland; when: present day after three years). Closure is resonant reconfiguration—Maren commits to descending, foreclosing stasis with felt cost (abandoning surface world, risking further loss). However, the final image lacks explicit cost articulation; the “mineral dampness” implies consequence but doesn’t crystallize price as sharply as elite publishability demands.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maren reweights “meaning” itself, realizing fractures must be made visible—a direct inversion of her prior pursuit of balance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory detail and symbolic layering until the final image reconfigures the story’s moral calculus. Cost is legible in the luminous seams and her admission of five years lost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the soldier disperses not through absolution but laughter, reweighting shame with joy. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered sound, light, and memory—and the final image (“luminous morning”) crystallizes Mira’s Charged Poise: she continues, wounded but unwavering. Cost is legible in her “familiar ache,” and the gorge’s acoustics function as both setting and causal constraint. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira halts at the ultraviolet clearing, fully aware of the uncalculated price ahead, rooted in devastation rather than fleeing into numbness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density, memory flashes, and bodily tremors until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in “trade the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger,” and the pewter strap’s hum crystallizes stakes. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but pays off functionally at closure, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lens fragment shifts from relic to relay, redefining the protagonist’s identity and purpose. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—each sensory detail, memory shard, and market encounter layers meaning until the final image crystallizes the “eternal instant.” Cost is legible in the forfeiture of passive remembrance for active stewardship, charged by the grandmother’s silent approval. Orientation is swift, precise, and functional disorientation (liminal market) pays off directly in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus reaches for the hidden hatch, crystallizing his stance as both repairman and receiver of echoes, with cost legible in the “potential energy that had never been released” now transferred to him. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory detail (dust, temperature drop, plaster cracks) until the pattern breaks at the hatch reveal. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“abandoned circus ticket office,” “Marcus,” “demolition crew next week”). Every beat tightens pressure toward the ceiling’s secret, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the whisper’s release reweights reality’s rules, forcing the Library to grow new sections. Cost is legible in the shuddering orchard, shattered frost, and Elara’s compressed timeline. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via frost patterns, destabilized books, and syllabic expansion—and the rupture reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution. Every beat flows from Elara’s agency; coincidence complicates (the frost reveals), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: truth matters less than what civilizations choose to make of it. The storm’s backward time-currents expose the founders’ desperation, reweighting the archaeological dispute with visceral cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density (amber time, reflective surfaces) and cadence shifts culminating in Charged Poise. Every beat tightens around Vespera’s method, culminating in a resonant final image that crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchestrion’s first note reconfigures silence into possibility, with visible cost—the light remains incomplete, the theft un-reversed. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; pressure builds via sensory density and ritual precision, not causality. Orientation is immediate (“resonance chamber,” “Cassian,” “forty years”), and the final image makes loss and restoration legible in one breath. Every beat tightens around the central stake: can a stolen song be remembered?

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lagoon reweights all prior petrichor as mere echo of this sourceless silence. Cost is legible in Elara’s irreversible departure (“She would not return”) and the compass’s function shifting from navigation to revelation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each collected scent builds toward this dissolution of meaning. Orientation anchors instantly (“After the textile factory… shut down”), and causality flows via psychometric discovery → descent → arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Aria reweights her artistic practice as part of a “timewoven alliance,” with clear conceptual cost—the surrender of solitary genius for communal continuity. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: layered images in the slide, sedimented time, and rhythmic prose build to a resonant reconfiguration. The storm’s arc tightens pressure without coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is legible in the final image—her work now carries inherited obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through seasonal shifts, postcards, frost patterns, and light angles until the cathedral window’s hidden layers crystallize meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reweights the premise of unseen beauty into a moral-aesthetic stance, with cost felt in her transformed mural and the “quiet performance” of spring bulbs. The lens holds coherently, and the final image makes conceptual cost undeniable. Minor deduction for lack of a tangible forfeiture beyond time spent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Miriam accepts the parley’s terms, becoming the living archive of a truth “when all others had forgotten.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through ciphered debris, diary fragments, and lagoon imagery until the final ripple reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible: she inherits temporal burden, sacrificing personal resolution for historical fidelity. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30 (“floating library aboard the Zeppelin Persephone”), and the descent sequence tightens pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the cove reimagines itself through memory, not resurrection, with visible cost—Elias forgoes reunion, magic, and the past as refuge. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: memory density intensifies until lanterns ignite and shops materialize. Cost is legible in “bread cooling on racks that had never existed”—a world built on absence. Every beat tightens toward this earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence thickens into meaning through layered sensory and linguistic density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“the dead had not been silent; they had been speaking all along.” The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the world must now carry this newly audible weight of ancestral oaths. The foghorn’s absence isn’t loss but aperture, reweighting the entire premise. Orientation is flawless by line 3 (“three days ago,” “rooftop garden,” “last official oath scribe”).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until the vortex seals with Charged Poise: Elara’s understanding reconfigures time itself. Orientation is immediate (“icebound atrium,” “seventh heirloom seed saver”), and causality flows via ritual logic, not coincidence. The cost—centuries of grief and loss reversed into potential—is legible in the closing lines. Every beat tightens around the acorn cap and seedling, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s switch-throw crystallizes her role as guardian, echoing monastic vigilance while activating a modern warning cascade. The solstice hush breaks not with drama but with green lights blooming across stations—a reconfiguration of communal safety through individual action. Cost is legible in the invisible front’s arrival and the first rain below: time has run out, and she was just in time. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently from the opening glue-dry wait to the final propagation wave.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the janitor’s stance crystallizes in the final image of “gentle hands” holding cosmic detritus as both death and seed, with conceptual cost—the overlooked era’s hush deepens precisely because their work remains unseen. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through refracted rainbows, amber pulses, and repeated tracing until the final beat reweights “vulnerability” as strength. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the star’s “naked exposure of no longer being what one once was.”

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira accepts guardianship of silence, foreclosing retreat into pure observation. The cost—bearing “crushing weight” while holding “impossible lightness”—is legible in the final image. Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds until the stained glass box crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery and recurring motifs until the final Conceptual Repricing: time as “the space between breaths.” The closure is resonant and charged, with clear conceptual cost—the surrender of measurement for meaning—and the emerald silo’s hum crystallizes this stance. Orientation is deliberately disorienting early on but pays off functionally at closure, so no penalty applies. The lens holds coherently from midpoint to end, with the urn fragment’s reweighting serving as the pivotal intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the poet accepts incompleteness, crystallizing a stance that reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—the kite cannot fly, yet gestures skyward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered images (feather, kite, bird) until the final image reweights all. Cost is legible in “the string was missing” and the feather left behind. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through layered observation until the closing image reweights everything: copper-wire music as gratitude crystallizes Maren’s Earned Stasis. Orientation is immediate (“Maren walked… bare feet… mosaic path”), and the cost—her death before seeing full flowering—is legible in “She would not live to see…” The botanical diary and wire serve as persistent constraints that shape tactics and charge closure. No causality breaks; reflection is anchored and interleaved with action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (amber, footprints, rain) until the final conceptual repricing: “homecoming was not arrival but recognition.” Cost is legible—the loss of career, certainties, and the irreversible shift in self. The closure crystallizes as Charged Poise, with Elena’s descent bearing the weight of earned insight, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reef’s first green thread reweights ecological collapse as reversible through memory and intention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (bird calls, seed pods, dead languages) culminating in a resonant final image. Cost is legible: decades of labor, the weight of extinction, and the risk of futility. Orientation is clear by line 20, and the single-scene structure fits the 600–800 word scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist reconfigures silence into presence, distance into closeness, with clear emotional cost (“seven harvests ago… heard nothing since”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory detail and recurring motifs until the groove-reading breakthrough. Cost is legible in the final image: holding leaf and voice amid ruins. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (sketching, stars, silence) until the “glimpse” crystallizes into Charged Poise—a reconfiguration where Mira accepts wonder over mastery. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Mira; where: observation deck; when: post-shutdown). The closure lands with conceptual cost: she forgoes temporal control, embracing uncertainty. The shutdown isn’t reversed, but its meaning is repriced—precisely what this length demands.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Caelius stole the lid, he seeks amends; therefore, he trades relics, learns secrets, and offers chess pieces. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Caelius steps into the unknown with visible emotional cost (“weight lifted”) and irreversible consequence. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when), and the sky’s wrongness pays off thematically at closure. The reset (“Wait—I have miscounted…”) is a controlled artifact that deepens rather than confuses causality.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure escalating through sensory density and pattern intensification rather than causal turns. Orientation is immediate: “whispering gallery,” “interregnum,” and Mira’s footsteps anchor who, where, and when by line 3. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “luminous absence” reweights silence as historical record, with cost legible in the empty chessboard and unreplaced pawns. The final image—history written in footsteps—makes the before/after undeniable without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seer’s crystallized decision to carry her talent outward reweights every prior beat with cost—she leaves sanctuary, embraces nightly fractures as doorways, and reclaims prophecy not as curse but garden. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: density builds via repeated tactile engagement with the stone, culminating in a cadence shift (“I want to remember what home felt like…”) that triggers translation. Cost is legible in the final image—her warm pocketed stone against the mountain’s exhale—and the keeper’s quiet certainty that she’ll return only when pain transforms into honoring. Orientation is taught early (“mountain’s throat,” “translucent form”) and pays off in closure’s spatial and emotional choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira forgives herself by reinterpreting her “failure” through the tapestry’s hidden truth, foreclosing exile’s internal prison with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via frayed threads, thunder’s cadence, frozen villagers—culminating in a Charged Poise where rain and movement resume but her stance is crystallized. Cost is legible in the line: “her hands finally still, her mind quiet in a way it had not been since the trial.” Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: truth refracted into children’s voices renders the ritual impotent. The “price of forgiveness” transforms from external surrender to self-liberation, with visible cost (prior losses, current risk). Orientation is immediate (“pale spire in mist,” Sera’s back against bone), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoes, mist, and verses tightens pressure until the priests’ arrival proves futile.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the breaking *is* the point, and meaning emerges through uncertainty. The Acid Sea’s pressure creates a causal-tightened frame (three breaths), and each memory-scar match deepens stakes without deflating tension. The final image—sea retreating as she smiles “uncertain still”—reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost: forty years of work dissolving, yet understanding reborn. Orientation is clear by line 3; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (mirror, shell, light, water) until the pool’s reflection triggers a Conceptual Repricing: art as offering, not capture. The closure is earned—a Charged Poise where Marcus renounces ownership but reclaims creation, with visible cost (three years lost, the discarded shell). Disorientation early (“stranger’s face”) pays off in the final clarity, satisfying the Orientation Test via functional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira endures alone, foreclosing reliance on Thessaly or conventional signals, with visible cost in her trembling attention and the weight of untested belief. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds sensory and emotional density (heat, jasmine, flares) until the cadence shifts at the uncorking, reweighting the dominant stake (guidance through vibration vs. light). The logbook’s thirty-year gap breached by one line crystallizes transformation. Every beat tightens toward that charged poise where silence becomes action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density through layered imagery and ritual objects until the closure—a Charged Poise where Mara and the caller stand together at the marsh’s edge, reconfiguring loss into companionship. Cost is legible: Mara abandons isolation to meet another’s pain, and the signal station’s dark beacon underscores that human presence, not machinery, now guides. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality flows through emotional logic, not plot mechanics. The moon’s phase and censer foot anchor time and choice without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (orchard, glass eye, truffles, textbooks) that converge in the hollow. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to study amid wreckage reconfigures isolation as active resistance, with clear cost—her truthfulness makes her a target, and safety is cultivated alone. The storm’s fresh scars and the orchard’s suspended roots provide causal texture that tightens stakes without linear plot; every image deepens the central tension between memory and erasure. The ending crystallizes options: retreat into silence or persist in forbidden knowledge—and she chooses the latter, fully aware of the price.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aldric doesn’t act decisively but crystallizes a new stance—connection replaces isolation—with visible cost (the lifelong gap now acknowledged, not erased). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: meaning accrues through sensory density (mist, violet-grey light, brittle petals) and patterned absences (vanished footprints, locked memories) until the folded paper breaks the pattern. The nautical twilight setting and lighthouse beam provide temporal and spatial anchors within 120 words. The only flaw: the stranger’s backstory resolution leans slightly on coincidence, though it’s mitigated by thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (ants, maps, flowers), and cadence build toward a Charged Poise closure. The “doorway of decisions” crystallizes Maren’s lifelong search into a single threshold, with the rising creek imposing irreversible stakes. Cost is legible in the final image—she steps through as the cavern floods, trading the known world for an uncharted home. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is clear by line 3: disenchanted queen, violet dusk, ridge path. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and recurring images (starlight, fireflies, breath) until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she smiles, reborn, with mystery solved and purpose reclaimed. Cost is felt in the three years of weariness now shed; the mountain’s summons forecloses return to passive rule.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the ember nexus serving as a crucible where presence accrues like nacre. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: “The shell doesn’t hold the secret. We do”—a resonant reweighting of the entire premise with clear cost (abandoning extraction for shared attention). The spiral structure mirrors the thematic density, and the pocket-sun’s cooling embodies irreversible change. Every beat tightens around the central stake: how to carry aliveness forward.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recursive imagery (scroll, grave, soaring) until the final Charged Poise: mailing the chronicle to a future self who “might finally understand.” Cost is legible in the “tears I didn’t realize I was shedding” and the surrender to feral nostalgia. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but pays off at closure—the temporal confusion isn’t a flaw but the engine of meaning. The scroll’s filling and the decision to descend tomorrow crystallize stakes without causal linearity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, silence, and occluded views build density until the birthing screw revelation reweights time itself as sacred labor. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elena realizes sensing was never about smell but attention—and cost is legible in her relinquished identity (“no longer mourned what she had lost”). The shop’s suspended morning becomes a charged poise where ordinary miracles are unveiled through stillness, not action. Every beat tightens around this reframing without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through sensory density and symbolic recurrence until the “held breath” crystallizes into action. Orientation is immediate: Elara, floating platform, post-storm liminality—all anchored by line 3. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she writes her truth as thunder breaks, and the runes hold, reconfiguring her relationship to magic, grief, and lineage. Cost is legible in the final image—her tears become ink, her scars become narrative—proving the price of belief was her lifelong shame.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural + Causal), with pressure tightening through sensory density (chainsaw cough, flickering form) and causal linkage (the induced current enables the encounter). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s Charged Poise crystallizes as she climbs into gray light, carrying both loss and the seed of renewal. Cost is legible in the falling orchard and Margot’s dissolution—options foreclosed, yet growth implied. The drive lens holds coherently from hush to fall.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story lacks closure: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page. Elara arrives at the Spiral but performs no act that alters options, knowledge, or meaning. The ending is atmospheric stasis, not charged poise—the cost is implied but never legible. Orientation is strong early, but without escalation or resolution, the causal chain halts before climax, violating the core requirement for 600–800 word publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory detail and philosophical reflection until the climax—a Conceptual Repricing: “clocks measured change itself.” The closure is resonant and charged with cost (Aira’s solitude, her rejection of atomic precision, her lifelong devotion). Orientation is clear by line 30; the lens is taught early and held. The “razor edge” motif culminates in a crystallized final image that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s departure is confirmed not by action but by the man’s unprecedented speech and the fungal light’s response, reconfiguring silence into connection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (bioluminescence brightening, footsteps) and patterned distance until the single line of dialogue fractures the status quo. Cost is legible in what remains unspoken: every conversation they never had lives in that crack. Orientation is immediate (“mushroom farm,” “Mira,” “before morning birdsong”), and the single scene tightens without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lantern’s light joining hospital fluorescents reconfigures risk from a game to a shared vulnerability. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered motifs (lantern, scrawls, probability) that culminate in a cadence shift at the ending, where meaning multiplies from accumulated loss. Cost is legible in the father’s surrendered newspaper and Elara’s unsendable letter. Every shard (library, subway, hospital) serves the pattern taught early, with transitions anchored by the lantern and rain.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final phone ring crystallizes Mira’s enduring stance, reconfiguring “endings” as thresholds requiring witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through layered wrong calls, resonant details, and the harmonica’s awakening—culminating in a cost felt in absence: no names, no thanks, only the loop. The tunnel’s rhythms and streetlamp hum anchor time and place by line 3, satisfying orientation. Cost is legible in the last line: she waits again, foreclosing personal recognition for communal service.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archivist redefines preservation not as freezing time but as allowing memory to breathe, a stance crystallized in the final image of her walking shoreward with “haunted euphoria.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via layered sensory details and recurring motifs (tea-steeping, walnut ink, jetty blooms), culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the covenant’s meaning. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the illusion of perfect archival control, embracing change as part of remembrance. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the logistician stops running, stays, and asks for what they need—a decisive renunciation with clear cost (exposure, vulnerability). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of backstory fragments, sensory detail, and thematic recurrence, culminating in a cadence shift at “truly laughed.” Orientation is anchored early (crumbling platform, ivy, fading light), and the rumor-chain setup pays off thematically without causality breaks. Cost is legible in the final image: laughter as both release and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the stillpoint reframes emotional depth as navigable terrain, with the cost being Elara’s relinquishment of outward mapping in favor of soul-architecture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering (ultrasonic hum, bark Braille, musical notes) until the cadence shift at the “held breath” crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (blind cartographer in forest), and the “pause of shifting constellations” functions as both temporal anchor and metaphysical hinge. Every beat tightens toward the resonant reconfiguration of self as map.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (bending, filtering, breath) until the signal’s “response” crystallizes meaning.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered annotations, time shifts, and symbolic density until the closure crystallizes as Charged Poise: the birth of the true heir signals inevitable collapse without on-page confrontation. The library’s breathing architecture and drifting constellations anchor orientation by line 30, satisfying the Orientation Test. Cost is legible in Threnody’s endless vigil—centuries of solitude—and the final image reweights all prior acts as purposeful. The rune pattern’s delayed payoff is taught early and lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the revelation that paths transform rather than vanish reweights the entire premise. The delayed data stream functions as both plot turn and thematic pivot, with cost legible in Elara’s halted rhythm—“its absence felt like waking from a dream.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (new tapping) deepens stake without causal contrivance. Anchors are clear by line 30; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kira’s resolve crystallizes options—rebellion reignites not through violence but remembrance—with conceptual cost (bearing the weight of meaning-making). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sensory hum, twilight deepening, and symbolic objects converging at the stone circle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: tradition isn’t discarded but fulfilled through evolution. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the chorus of plants, shifting amber embryo, and cryptic kite coalesce into a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost (breaking silence = risking witchcraft accusations). Anchors are solid by line 30. The final image reweights the entire premise: destiny is cultivated, not inherited.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces healing-as-destination and builds “a place” where optimism grows from realistic soil—a Charged Poise crystallized in the night-blooming cereus. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief arrives like weather, but each recurrence tightens her somatic anchoring until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the unsmoothed photograph and the lighthouse kept dark—symbols of foreclosed futures. Orientation anchors immediately: “She found the lighthouse property three years after the wedding that wasn’t.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reweights “fragmentation” from curse to gift, crystallized in the final image of the repaired box “woven into a pattern that no longer needed fixing.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density and symbolic layering, not causal chain. Cost is legible: she surrenders the illusion of control, accepting that art must accommodate flux. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early (“forgotten by everyone except those who no longer remembered themselves”) but pays off thematically at closure, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tracker doesn’t solve time’s mystery but becomes part of its mechanism, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—his physical erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through ink patterns, drone observation, and environmental stillness until the world dissolves into ephemeral logic. The eclipse’s end and spilled ink serve as causal anchors, and the final image—drone recording empty space—makes the cost undeniable. One flaw: Vasquez’s fate is inferred but never tested, slightly softening the inciting incident’s payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kira’s transmission crystallizes options, reconfiguring silence from shroud to held breath, with undeniable conceptual cost—the end of historical myth.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the opening image through closure, with each sensory detail deepening the thematic weight of continuity amid collapse. Orientation is immediate (“glass dome,” “desert roses,” “three seasons past”) and never falters. The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing: peace redefined as active tending rather than passive absence, crystallized in the final sentence with undeniable cost—Mira’s solitude, her father’s legacy unavenged. No causal breaks; every reflection is anchored in present stimuli and alters stance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Morwen endures and receives rather than seizes, foreclosing the path of grasping others took, with clear cost (isolation, silent burden). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (sound-as-light, emotion-as-weight), culminating in a cadence shift at “the absence of every sound that had ever hurt him.” Constellations’ broken patterns reconfigure post-resolution, proving change. Every beat tightens toward the garden’s heart; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Eleanor reconfigures her stance from passive inheritor to active investigator, with the cost of confronting her own house made legible in the final descent. The causal lens holds—each ancestor’s compromise sets up her dilemma, and the journalist’s call triggers a logical unraveling that culminates in decisive action. Orientation is clear by line 30; the observatory setting anchors time, place, and emotional register. The final image reweights the city as “an unfinished story,” crystallizing stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Mira follows the letters, she finds the lab; because she inserts the amber, the firmware activates; because she hears the cries, she intervenes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she doesn’t undo the past but reconfigures its meaning by mapping “stars of redemption” across her timeline. The cost—seventeen years of guilt crystallized into one trembling act—is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the folded-time logic pays off cohesively at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered echoes of the past until the tessera’s patterns shift—a decisive intensification that reweights the entire premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lysara’s act of renaming crystallizes a new covenant between past and future, with felt cost in what cannot be restored (voices, lives) and what is forged instead (unburnable compassion). The bell’s ring and shaft of light serve as earned, non-mechanical symbols of resurrection, not explanation. Every shard of backstory is anchored in present stimuli (ash, stone, child’s eyes) and alters tactics—no reflection without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira sees her failure as necessary, rejoining the “fractured whole” with conceptual cost—the audition’s ruin now reframed as a threshold. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes intensify into a tapestry of might-have-been, culminating in the coin’s bleed into “all cards.” Cost is legible in Elara’s lifted weight and Mira’s red-rimmed eyes—despair exchanged for possibility, not erased.

The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned details (scratches, letters, locket) accrue meaning until the estranged sister’s tears reweight everything. Cost is legible—the grandmother’s decades-long vigil, the unsent letters’ emotional weight—and the final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira steps into dry corridor not by luck but by years of encrypted labor, with the draining water marking a decisive shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (dice, journal, dance) until their convergence unlocks the chamber. Cost is legible in her voicelessness, her solitude, her years submerged; the spider’s continued weaving underscores that liberation is ongoing, not final. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact through poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through salt, memory, and gravity until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: deleted memories reside in salt beneath the lighthouse. Orientation is immediate (“dock-side lantern lighter… morning after the whale beached”), and the spiral descent into the chamber tightens pressure without causal breaks.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory detail and symbolic layering until the tapestry’s question crystallizes. Cost is legible in the “frayed threads” and the weight of unacknowledged compassion, though the physical act of climbing back up lacks visceral consequence. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the structure tightens meaningfully from discovery to decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of metaphor and idea culminating in Charged Poise: Elara hovers over the blank page, options legible, stakes crystallized. Cost is felt in the weight of expectation, the solitude, the “frozen” state of potential—embodied in the lake’s ice and the quill’s burden. Orientation is immediate and stable; closure reweights the premise without mechanical resolution. The only hairline flaw: the “chain reaction” typo (“连锁反应”) briefly fractures immersion but doesn’t impair causality.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dust, mist, glow, melody) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: stories aren’t lost—they’re latent, waiting to be sung awake. Orientation is immediate (“years after the story famine,” “Mira worked by candlelight”), and closure lands in Charged Poise—her singing reconfigures silence into possibility, with palpable cost in secrecy and fragility. The dust’s “memory” isn’t magic but a metaphor made operational, tightening stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Mira’s final stance crystallizes options (to honor through reconstitution, not completion) with undeniable conceptual cost—the mirage of safety dismantled, replaced by honest grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density (ash → mask → light) and cadence shift (silence → creak → tears). The rocking chair’s final creak functions as both motif and temporal anchor, making the before/after legible. Every image tightens around the central stake: how to memorialize the unknowable.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator reaffirms their refusal of the “easy story,” crystallizing a stance that forecloses reconciliation with the surface settlement. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—the story builds pressure through layered evidence, not causal plot turns. Cost is legible in the final image: “Someone will find these artifacts someday…” implies lifelong obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Dr. Vance lifting the letter reweights the entire premise of “noble lies” with undeniable social cost—truth’s rescue demands emotional honesty alongside rational analysis. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint (layered mythmaking, ivy-as-time, petal-drop as temporal cue) and held through closure. Cost is legible in the line: “even knowing they would disturb the town that had honored her grandfather for his silence.” Orientation is solid within 120 words; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pavilion’s “long forgetting” is countered by Maren’s act of carrying its story, reweighting abandonment as continuity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering and recurring motifs (kelp, waterline, notes) until the final image crystallizes meaning.
