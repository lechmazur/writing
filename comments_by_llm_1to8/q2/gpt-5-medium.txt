  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early through dust-patterns metaphor and held through closure. The final beat—dust resettling into a new map after Mara's breath—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize around patient noticing vs. spectacle-chasing, with conceptual cost legible in the renunciation of "theatrics." Orientation anchors (Mara, greenhouse, post-flood) land by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when neighbors arrive and collective sweeping reweights individual heroism. Cost is visible in the surrender of rescue narrative for "rehearsal."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (glass, frost, breath, canyon) layer toward a conceptual repricing where the protagonist chooses a "steadily adaptive answer, neither cold nor hot, but annealed." Orientation anchors (luminous glass artist, canyon under stars, after surviving the attempt) appear early. The closure—creating a frost-legible window to testify at the guild—lands as Charged Poise, crystallizing the protagonist's method without executing it on the page. Cost is conceptual (choosing midpoint over destruction or direct accusation) but the felt price remains oblique; the rival's exposure is future-tense, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern repetition (tuning forks, frost, silence) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallizes in "We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the conservatory introduction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist corrects the algorithm by walking the riverbank, reweighting the translation practice. Cost is conceptual and felt (the hush, the drowned choir, the continued effort) but the final image's price reads more affirmed than paid; no on-page option is visibly foreclosed at closure, nudging the Charged Poise toward the softer edge of RR.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clear by the opening beat (mortuary, package, sea); the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through lyric patterning and held through closure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the undertaker commits to giving rest a permanent address, and the final image ("he is at work") crystallizes the shift with conceptual cost (he forgoes return, becomes registry-keeper). The meaningful tightening occurs when the lens hums and reveals the manual, narrowing options from passive receipt to active construction of the beacon. Cost is legible in the etch ("forwarding order") and the open-ended vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes pressure through repeated food runs, patrol encounters, and the bell's evolving meaning, culminating in spring's arrival when "there were fewer lists, fewer boots." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the community endures and the bell is polished "until our faces wobbled there," reweighting the opening image with felt cost. The "constellations" framing and midnight-run mechanics provide legible escalation. One orientation issue: the narrator's identity and the exact geography of "hill village" and "ridge" remain vague through the first third, but the communal lens mitigates confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). The viaduct-blooms-breath pattern accumulates density and the final image ("viaduct breathe easier") reweights the hoarded-love premise with felt cost (the "storage closet unlatch behind my ribs"). Orientation anchors POV, twilight viaduct, and the past-life frame early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass woman turns toward the street, unlocking the storage closet. Cost is legible in the decanting metaphor and the physical sensation of release, though the mechanism remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the halo fragment's repeated activation deepens the narrator's engagement with layered pasts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when the protagonist accepts that "the present is a continual photograph fading" and the fragment becomes a ring. The orientation anchors are present early (hedge maze designer, living bridge garden, halo fragment at throat) and the causality is lyric-associative rather than strictly because/therefore, which fits the lens. Cost is legible: the protagonist surrenders the fantasy of fixed exits for grief and instead accepts perpetual texture and fading. One concern: the middle section's rapid scene-flips (father measuring hedges, library fire, pavilion, underwater vault) risk feeling like a catalog rather than a tightening pressure, though the cumulative weight does recharge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, carnival prize center, wall demolition) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through lyric repetition and image layering, with a cadence shift at closure when Mara distributes seeds and the metaphor crystallizes. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—her carrying seeds forward with "chained liberator" identity intact reweights the opening dust image with visible cost (she remains bound, on the move, work unfinished). One meaningful deepening occurs when she descends to the vault and the abstract mission becomes tactile parcels, altering her immediate task and the story's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the forge work and listening devices gather meaning across beats until the final imprint delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist records trust's prelude rather than its fracture, reweighting the original quest). Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words—but the orchard-forge setting and synesthetic framing eventually stabilize. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (the partner's betrayal is processed but not repaired, and the devices now teach preemptive awareness), though the cost feels more reflective than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (portrait thief), where (emerald station), and when (golden sunset) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and metaphoric layering build toward the final image where moonbeams animate the failed photographs and the mentor is restored, reweighting the theft/return dynamic. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—"from taking to returning"—with conceptual cost legible in the line "which were no longer stolen, only kept until their owners arrived." One meaningful deepening occurs when the jar's use shifts from navigation aid to redemptive tool.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ceremonial narration early and sustains it through closure. Orientation anchors (Arlen, control room, northern ice) land within the first 120 words. The closure—vessels left on the console, the room "brightened at being included," and the final whispered purpose—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Arlen completes his ritual preparation with visible labor cost ("arms shook") and foreclosed solitude. One tightening occurs when he moves from solitary work to planning the gathering. Cost is legible in the physical toll and the commitment to hold space for others' fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a Causal lens: the protagonist decrypts notes, uses bone-break dates as a combination, climbs to the roof, and confronts his brother in a sequence driven by because/therefore linkage. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the brothers "unlocked our shared name by speaking both versions") with felt relational cost. The escalation from discovery to decryption to rooftop confrontation narrows options meaningfully. One structural weakness: the seashell's guidance ("Go to the roof") and the brother's convenient presence there rely on coincidence that borders on convenience plotting, slightly undermining the earned causality of the decryption work.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (oracle, ridge fort, single star). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the oracle stays to finish the map while the courier departs, crystallizing their divergent paths with felt cost (her isolation, his burden). The decision reweights prior material: the map becomes both instrument and testament. One meaningful deepening occurs when the courier admits his mission to burn records, raising stakes and narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (looped timelines, numbered repetitions) and maintains coherent pressure through density increase and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening lines. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist chooses custodial practice over revelation-seeking, foreclosing the investigative path with felt cost ("There is no grand revelation, only the way the ice remembers my fingerprints of attention"). The conceptual price—accepting mundane repetition as the answer—lands legibly in the final third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the violin "draws frost not from air but from me," tightening the stake from external observation to internal participation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the registrar's public confession and the communal repair of the projector crystallize trust with visible cost—they risk their post and the curator/troupe visibly reconcile. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated doodle discoveries, the lens-as-witness motif, and the gathering crowd, then breaks in the bandstand scene where transparency reweights mistrust. Orientation anchors early (registrar, forecourt, night, post-rain) and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (private investigation → public exposure) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (mutual recognition between gardener and garden) with visible cost: the narrator accepts being "mended too, stitched by seasons. / Not whole, but honest enough." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds through ritual repetition, the maze's objection, and the vine's half-blooming state, culminating in the unlatched gate as trust enacted. Orientation anchors (garden, dials, maze) appear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the maze "objected with elegance" and forced confession, narrowing the narrator's options from performance to penance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (frost, compasses ticking, vault singing) and the closure reconfigures the premise—sideways time proven not by data but by affection and the glimpsed doubled self. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (plateau rim, station, frost). One meaningful deepening occurs when Jae inverts the fields and the mantas return, then a second reconfiguration at the ending when he sees his own temporal double and chooses silence, foreclosing the public proof path with felt cost. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands on the page: "liked that the proof arrived as an affection, not a test, and felt forgiven" crystallizes his stance shift. Closure cost is legible but slightly oblique—he gains proof yet withholds it, a renunciation that charges the final image without a sharp visible sacrifice scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (program stains → constellation maps → portrait → batons), and the final beat—conducting rests until the portrait softens and the program rearranges into dawn—reconfigures the dominant stake (breaking the drowning loop) with a cadence shift. Conceptual cost is legible: the musician must honor silence and step only on reflections, a constraint that shapes tactics. One tightening is present (the discovery that the score is "a choreography for silence"), but the closure leans on atmospheric repricing rather than a decisive action that alters options with felt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist names the lie aloud in the oracle's presence, and the final image—the folded gentian with its smudge-map—reweights the swallowed truth with undeniable cost (release of secrecy, acceptance of perpetual sway). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: the gentian and smudge recur with escalating pressure, the scale and anemometer anchor ritual, and the storm's arrival on schedule charges the ending. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening (circling inward to name the lie) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece builds pressure through layered reflection, radio fragments, and the protagonist's gradual engagement with the valve wheel, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—forgiveness of the wheel, not the people, with the act of opening the valve). The closure is clean: "I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open, and the sigh unknotted" forecloses vengeance or blame with a visible physical act and felt cost. Orientation is anchored early (tunnel, alone, valve wheel, radio). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator turns the wheel and imagines the quota day, reweighting the stake from ghost-hunting to confronting complicity. Cost is legible in the refusal to forgive human actors and the choice to correct the mechanical wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of image accumulation and cadence modulation by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper renews the oath to witness without gripping, tethered by regenerative silence. Cost is conceptual—continuation of crumbling peace, isolation, floating reality—but the final image ("renews me as it repairs the fragile world") makes the price of endurance legible. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive early enough. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flood forces retreat and the obsidian room "mends" the keeper, shifting the stakes from passive observation to active partnership with silence. The lens holds, but causality is thin; events accumulate rather than narrowing options in a causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ada's finger tracing the locket curve "to keep it alive" crystallizes her shift from isolation to shared wondering with visible cost—she must hold the question rather than resolve it. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases through sensory layering (cooled air, silvered light, cricket chorus) and culminates in a cadence shift at totality when "the courtyard inhaled together." One meaningful deepening (the locket on the guitar body) narrows Ada's emotional stance and reweights the opening image of her guarding the keepsake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens by the opening tercet and sustains it through layered images and objects. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the historian commits to teaching walls to speak and stitching a world from echoes, foreclosing the option of mere passive collection with visible conceptual cost ("If dreams are finished..."). The cost is legible in the final image of pulse and echo, though quieter than exemplary high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (fortune-writer), where (harbor/lighthouse), and when (after last orders) by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (envelope → specs → sugar-inked fortunes → light projection) and resolves in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "You already know" unfurls on kitchen walls, reweighting the town's open secrets with visible social cost ("everyone finally looked"). The causal chain from taking specs to lighthouse to projecting fortunes holds cleanly. Cost is legible: the agent receives a blank, the town's etiquette shifts, and the protagonist accepts complicity ("their shoulders said thank you for arranging the tide").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (loop pedal stacking silence, rhetorical devices as investigative tools) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara "chose her own name again" after the whisper finds no purchase, with visible cost in the relational and dimensional stakes. Orientation anchors chapel, priest, and Mara by the second paragraph. The escalation proceeds through density increase—anaphora, chiasmus, antithesis—that reweights Mara's agency, and the closure image ("the night relented") reconfigures the dimensional threat with conceptual cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered memory-rooms and sensory motifs until the final paragraph reconfigures fortunes as breath instructions with cost (the diner's ribs will feel the dawn). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the fortune-writing premise is reweighted from riddle to conductor's score—with felt cost implied in "the shell cools, sated by its own echo." Orientation anchors (Glass spire, frozen lake, fortune writer's room) arrive early. One modest density increase when dawn "takes the podium" and the conductor metaphor crystallizes suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern early (drop/ripple interval, procedural generation, rain-guided path) and teaches its lyric recursion through the viaduct walk. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist lowers, lets the tablet erase, and walks without urgency—a renunciation that forecloses flight with visible cost ("erasing the seed I had already harvested," "no urgency to fly"). The orientation is deliberately oblique but coherent by midpoint; causality operates through accumulative reweighting rather than because/therefore linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tablet reveals "my own handwriting" and the message reframes conquest as surrender, which charges the final walk with cost and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara's discovery that listening backward enables moving forward reweights her teaching practice with visible cost—she must now lead students through vulnerability rather than technique. The accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and the backwards-song ritual until the final image of footsteps writing softly crystallizes the shift. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reversed drumbeat "rubbed frost from the bones of the drum, and from the caves inside her chest."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist refuses the pursuer's script, delivers evidence laterally to the archivist, and accepts the role of "witness with a craft" rather than hero—foreclosing confrontation with felt cost. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative touches (weather imagery threads through); the pigeon's second use and the decoy-chart tactic create motivated escalation. Orientation anchors (courtyard, dusk, follower's presence) arrive promptly and the because/therefore chain holds through the final image of the ledger accepting weather "as it pleased."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers encounters—starlight arrival, lantern moment, energy being exchange, vision of clock-prison, mirror confrontation—building density toward the final vow and road re-entry. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the poet forgives the past and accepts the rope as present strength, foreclosing escape-fantasy with conceptual cost ("breathe only if I forgave"). Orientation anchors (grotto, poet, after beings arrive) land early. One deduction: the cost is more conceptual than felt; the mirror beat does not show a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing, only reflection and consent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece braids images (bowl, orchard, shipwrecks, music) toward a final cadence shift where communal practice replaces solitary playing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl fills, the group decides to "visit the halves and the almosts," and footprints remain as "a song that refuses to be done." Cost is conceptual—the chronic hush "loosens one more braid" rather than vanishes—but the final image reweights the opening stake legibly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, conceptual language ("half truths as stable carriers"), and the ritualized exchange. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Rhea's transformation crystallizes in the final image with felt cost ("her future had learned to walk beside others"). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rhea articulates the herd's faith and the narrator responds with the core insight about listening versus pretending to be landscape, which reweights the stakes and leads directly to the affectionate-detachment resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: layers of names, gestures, and harbor-music metaphors build toward a community ledger that reweights earlier isolation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exchange of ledger key and bookmark crystallizes shared custodianship, and the promise to "keep listening" reconfigures the opening silence with undeniable social cost (public accountability now replaces secrecy). However, orientation anchors drift—"breezy library under stars" and "colonnaded roof" compete without settling spatial logic by ~120 words, and the symphony-to-library transition compresses cause/effect linkage. Cost is legible but primarily conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing sharpens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (crystalline orchard, crater, marsh-reed sculptor). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the search for the tag accumulates community participation, and the final discovery ("a repeatable curve...Together") reweights the opening ache with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost—committing practice rather than a finished statue—is legible and closes the circuit. One meaningful deepening (discovery of the posture, ring of bodies) tightens the stake. The elliptical middle (baker, diver legends) risks ornamental drift but the closure pulls material together.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of metaphor-dense observation early and maintains it through closure. The RR lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist unseals the oval, releases the larva, and witnesses the first echo bloom—reconfiguring her relation to borrowed time with felt cost ("the nap tug the seconds from my cuffs"). Causality within the accumulative frame is clean: seeking → finding → borrowing → witnessing → releasing → repaying. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the larvae "needed to be uncaged," narrowing her observational stance to ethical action. Minor tension: the "bells counted a number that did not match the hour" warns of debt but does not visibly constrain the final sketching decision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established by ~80 words (conjurer, cavern orchard, post-moon silence). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he cannot solve the theorem but chooses to carry it, dovetailing the rope into his sleeve as memento and intention—a renunciation with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mosaic yields the cracked theorem and he realizes longing is a variable, reweighting his prior grief. Escalation is gentle but present: the ritual builds through fruit arrangement and eye-threading until the stone "replies" with the theorem, which he then decides to live rather than test.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the dweller's repeated acts of invisible service build toward the girl finding the notebook, reweighting his vow to become visible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the protagonist considers "how visibility might be crafted from service" and etches an arrow, crystallizing his method with the cost felt (remaining unseen). One cost-proof concern: the final withdrawal reads more as confirmation than foreclosure, though the arrow gesture does reconfigure his stance from passive to intentional trace-leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through recurring plant-behavior observations, pattern breaks when Mara stops retying vines, and the cadence shifts from active reconstruction to receptive witnessing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—"keep listening until the garden could hear itself through her"—with visible cost in renouncing her habit of command. Orientation anchors early (nursery owner, storm season, mossy trellis). One meaningful deepening is present: the shift from reconstruction to observation that forecloses the path of control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors solidly (tidal island, post-water-wars, painter with insomnia by line 3). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rain trails thread discovery → exchange → apparition → pact, with each beat deepening the island's contract. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (pact formalized, meaning threshed from endurance) with visible cost: the gnat released, warmth kept, silence accepted. One structural seam: the mother's fog-walk feels convenient rather than causally motivated, yet the pact that follows reweights all prior material and the final image of rain trails carrying the agreement forward delivers undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (singing cave, music choosing the pilgrim) and pays it off when the pearl "births a tone" and walls "inhabit themselves with echoes of bread lines." Orientation anchors by line 3 (clairvoyant, musical crystal cave, pilgrim with map). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the pearl's choice of the pilgrim reweights everyday magic with conceptual cost (the guide's prophecy broken, duty redefined). One minor causality slip: "unseen forces draft a different script" reads as convenience plotting, but the pearl's rolling toward the pilgrim is prepared by his scent of flour.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (archivist, harbor, post-exile). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated" reweights the premise with felt cost (the valve given away, practice instituted). The herald's trumpet valve seeds early, returns with altered meaning, and the final image of tide carrying "our small work" charges prior material. One meaningful deepening: from waiting-for to practicing-with. Cost is conceptual and relational but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first third. The closure unit—stepping through the mouth after laying down maps and receiving them back, then hanging unsaid words as lanterns—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. The phantom punch and arrows recur but their mechanics do not visibly narrow options at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (stargazer's tower, whale migration, narrator as auditor) are clear early. The piece accumulates density through journals, magic square, whale spirals, and Lio's shell until the "room" materializes as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—two chairs set, griefs exchange coats, gravity shares its center. Cost is felt (narrator names losses, professional clean-hands posture softens) and the final image reweights "skeptic with mercy" as Earned Stasis with visible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; closure lands cleanly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (immortal collector), where (prismatic escondite), and the solar storm context within the opening lines. The closure lands on-page: the amulet's curse revises its contract, the immortal gains edges/purpose, and Lio's potential forgiveness reweights the goodbye. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density and metaphoric layering build toward the corridor revelation and the final reconfiguration of goodbye as "blueprint of the next room." One meaningful deepening occurs when the corridor appears and redefines parting as infrastructure. Cost is felt (boredom sharpened, forgiveness deferred) but remains somewhat abstract rather than a concrete forfeiture that forecloses a path with unmistakable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist signs witness with the father's ink, transforming inherited tools of fraud into instruments of testimony, and the "new vowel of fairness" reweights the premise with felt cost (carrying evidence to the clinic attorney, cleaning away Arman's warmth). The lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone: density increases through layered imagery (ink pot, ledger, breach-as-inattention) and the cadence shifts from tense prep-room waiting to the quiet final cleaning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the reset chime dings and the window opens, narrowing options under taught constraint. Orientation anchors early: funeral home prep room, narrator washing a living man pretending to be dead.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes density through layered images (lamp hum, refracted light, bonsai needs, folded stories) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image ("patience answers patience") crystallizes the stationer's role as intermediary with felt cost (surrender of authorial claim). Orientation anchors who/where/what by line 9. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stories "travel downward…into emptied mail slots," reweighting the dominant stake from solitary practice to relational gift. Causality is loose but patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic pattern early (dock wandering, fragment-gathering) and maintains coherent pressure as scraps layer toward confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator places the label "like a small verdict" and walks away, crystallizing the widow's choice and his own nameless listener role with felt cost (he relinquishes claim to identity/justice). Orientation anchors (docks, containers, unnamed narrator) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison-bottle label connects to the widow's inventory, narrowing the narrator's approach and reweighting prior wandering. Cost is legible in the final image: he remains erased, choosing testimony over reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (fog, dome, shell, cello as recurring anchors) and accumulates pressure through density increase and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he accepts that the riddle was "never about certainty, but about kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity," packs the cello, and leaves with "cheerful gloom intact," foreclosing the pursuit of tidy answers with felt cost (the dome keeps humming without him). Orientation is swift (myth buster, abandoned observatory, fog, cliff) by the second paragraph. The accumulative design holds, though the middle could tighten one causal link between hums and the figure's arrival to clarify whether the method summons or simply accompanies the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Nessa's trade with the liaison follows from her encoding work, the chip-press into wet paint enables the raft realignment, which then produces the spending numbers that buy the season. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—steering "through paint and motion, toward a future that would not sell the past without buying our consent"—lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (one season bought, grammar teachable but not controllable). One persistent constraint (the foundation stone chip as authentication token) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the moth's flight and the narrator's realization that "keeping watch did not save the night, it simply kept the night from leaving alone" reweights the documentation task with visible emotional cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—density builds through layered sensory detail and timed chemical messages, then breaks in the final moth appearance. Orientation anchors (moonlit summit, crater, narrator alone) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the white vial exhales and the moth lifts, crystallizing the narrator's stance toward loss and witness with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the artisan completes the maiden voyage coupling through adaptive technique, the depot "exhales," and her smile mirrors the settled wheels—a legible before/after with felt cost (the fog crisis, the patch midair, the precision demanded). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering (mist, bowls, pips, anchor chain) until the fog thickens, forcing a tightening (more bowls, code patch), then resolution. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (artisan, depot, maiden voyage timing). One meaningful deepening (fog fold, hesitation, precision response) sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through layered pattern—breath on glass, condensation, the phrasebook's verbs—that converges when the editor turns the valve and "rivulets accepted their siblings." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the editor records the convergence, accepts the cost that "water that begins as one must learn to part again," and commits to following departure. Cost is conceptual and vocational (the map will breathe differently), legible in the final ledger-close and tomorrow's promise. One tightening deepens the stake from tracing to governance to departure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered ritual gestures and a widening circle of participation, culminating in the bell's ringing and the community's tentative agreement to continue. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the town commits to "the unglamorous rhythm of return" with the cost legible in the conditional phrasing ("perhaps a winter") and the refusal of victory. Orientation is delayed but functional; the archway and town are anchored by ~10% with purposeful lyric compression. One minor causality slip: the bell "spoke" and "reached into kitchens...uncurled the smell of thyme" without prior setup of how sound triggers olfactory memory in this world.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the hush gathers, the signal "takes," and the final image reweights the premise (rescue coaxed from ephemera) with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the temple fades "like a star at noon," options reconfigured with visible cost (the dive, the risk, the crew's survival still uncertain). One meaningful deepening occurs when the signal rides the hush outward and an answer thrums above, narrowing options and charging the final swim.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. The piece teaches its pattern early (metaphor-dense, image-driven) and accumulates pressure through spatial ascent and tightening focus on the drain. Closure arrives when the lattice is placed over the drain and "the muffled thing beneath it surrendered," but the cost remains oblique—no clear before/after in options or knowledge. The Orientation Test is narrowly satisfied by ~120 words (lighthouse prison, reef, narrator rowing, carrying lattice), though "before they find the bodies" introduces a time frame that never tightens tactics on the page, reducing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard's gradual awakening—bead drop, chime sway, sap bottling—builds pressure through density and cadence until the ghost bride dissolves and the keeper hangs the bead, reweighting the premise with felt cost (loss and completion in "mournful elation"). Orientation anchors who (keeper), where (greenhouse), and what (night orchard) by line six. The backstory ("Once you carried me from a river") arrives past midpoint and is exposition-heavy, but it primes the closure image of debt repaid. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the orchard learns to warm its own dark, the keeper keeps her vow) lands on the page with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story employs an accumulative/textural lens with lyric compression, and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Sera opens the sluices, the harbor refills, and the town answers with "small, continual yeses." Cost is implied (she leaves the plate, carries the tether) but not viscerally felt on the page—the final image is more symbolic than causal. Orientation anchors ("I am Sera," "the harbor has thinned," "the labyrinth mouth") arrive early, satisfying the Orientation Test. The escalation is textural (deepening ritual detail) rather than causal narrowing, appropriate to the lens, but the cost legibility is soft: the reader must infer sacrifice rather than see it embodied in a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric elision. Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, diaspora returnee, excavation) land by the third paragraph. The piece accretes pressure through recurring images (interrupted journeys, the sundial, roots braiding bones) that tighten around the faith-restoration stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator remains, tending trees and circling the stele—a renunciation of departure that forecloses the return abroad with visible cost in "my journey unbroken." The final orbit image reweights prior wandering motifs. One ambiguity: the flood that "swallowed the road" for the caravan guide feels like a late symbolic echo rather than a causal constraint on present action, slightly muddying whether the orchard's interruptions are historical metaphor or live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with purposeful pattern-teaching through chalk codes, margins, and the ebony clipboard as recurring anchors. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the protagonist holds the envelope above the slot, meaning "arranges itself like a flock," and pressure is undeniable in the final breath. Cost is felt but oblique—the hesitation implies risk and the weight of responsibility—though a sharper on-page consequence (a forfeited option, a visible price paid) would elevate clarity. The nostalgic reveal that the protagonist once left chalk marks as an apprentice reweights earlier material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt observatory, autumn, narrator with satchel) arrive promptly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator accepts blame and carries the rumor forward, crystallizing stance with the cost of future scapegoating made explicit ("You will be blamed"). The escalation accumulates through stitching → whisper → names in ash → keeper's warning, and the final image (eternal candle set to watch) reweights prior vigilance motifs. One persistent gap: the coup "rehearses each night in the dust" but remains abstract; the consequence of carrying the embroidery is asserted more than dramatized, slightly softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through interleaved reflection and present sensory anchor (skiff, lantern, shard, spirits' voices), deepening the narrator's stance from evasion to accountability. Orientation anchors arrive by the first paragraph (mangrove labyrinth, skiff, spirits). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator commits to "share the hinge and let it breathe us," reweighting the dominant stake (apology and relational repair) with felt cost—acknowledging shame and the risk of vulnerability. The cost is conceptual and relational, legible in "let silence not be armor" and the decision to speak the unsent letters aloud to the grove, then carry that act home. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator moves from seeking reversal to accepting "healing is not reversal, only a readable surface where new sentences can risk arriving."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes meaning through the cast's smudged notes, coral grooves, and shared anxieties, then reweights them in the mother's repetition of the Reka word and the uncle's nod. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (translator, atrium, boy wheeled away). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rain-treaty moment and coral-as-gift reconfigure the conflict without explicit resolution, and the cost is felt in the mother reaching for the uncle's sleeve. The final image of the translator leaving "my hand ungloved so the coral's memory keeps speaking" charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's boats are read by both families, tightening the shared stake.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene in accumulative/textural mode. A meaningful deepening occurs when the knowledge network corrects the damaged frames, reweighting the film from "merely exposed" to "revealing." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of "a ribbon in the fog" reweights the quest with undeniable conceptual cost (the work is ongoing, not complete). The lens holds, but the cost is oblique—no on-page forfeiture of a live option—limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (nested awakenings, layered images) and held through closure. The story deepens through three distinct image-layers (mason's daughter, dancing pair, patron's feast), each triggered by the protagonist's questions and choices. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph's "keeps asking, so that I keep waking, and the map keeps unfolding" crystallizes the exchange of certainty for ongoing curiosity with felt cost (lighter step, loosened certainty). Cost is legible in the protagonist's admission and the mural's open-ended state. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line ~60 words cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late causal push. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric compression, metaphor-as-fact, and mosaic world-building by the first third; the greenhouse setting, tax premise, and secret-language method are signaled early. Escalation operates through density increase (bees → gardens → city-wide warp) and a cadence shift at the climax (the collectors arrive, the singing begins). Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the officers laugh and "cancel their own levy" by performing intention, reweighting the premise's rule-set with visible social cost (the law's loophole exploited, the city's gardens networked). The cost is legible on the page in the officers' laughter and the bees carrying the refrain citywide. Minor orientation debt: "who" (the narrator's name, role) and "when" (calendar time, how long after taxation began) remain vague past 120 words, though the greenhouse and tax-tower world are anchored. Applying Orientation Test: −0.3 for delayed personal anchor; however, the disorientation serves the lyric mode and does not obscure the closure effect, so I waive the Q3 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (shell, postcard, lullabies, gardens) toward a final cadence shift where the poet "still wakes often, but rises gentler." Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the treaty and tending practice crystallize a new stance), but the cost is declared rather than shown: no on-page moment demonstrates what the poet sacrificed or forfeited to reach this armistice. The final image reweights prior material, yet the price remains conceptual and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**: repeated motifs (foxglove regret, glass-orchid, echo catalog) accumulate density and the final act reweights the opening's "humming with foxglove regret" through the protagonist's whispered self-test and the chime's grace-note answer. Orientation anchors (opal library, caretaker role, floating mooring) arrive by line 7, satisfying the waiver. The closure is a **Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)**: the protagonist whispers her own name to test forgetting, the chime answers, and she feels "permitted to sleep"—a crystallized stance where the cost (vigilance, the prior failure) charges the moment. The cost, however, is implied rather than visibly paid on the page in that beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Orientation anchors (arcane linguist, extinct language archive, pre-dawn arrival) land clearly in the opening. The piece accumulates pressure through the composition of the three-movement score, Lio's emergence, and the joint revision, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis evolving into Charged Poise) when both characters "set the Breviary back and let the archive breathe." Cost is visible in the shift from "terrible courtesy" to collaborative vulnerability and the explicitly rewritten coda that asks them to "confess doubts aloud." One notable gap: the stele incident is recounted but its causal link to Lio's three-year absence remains somewhat fuzzy, slightly weakening the because/therefore chain at the story's emotional hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (amphitheater, volcano, council gathering) arrive within the first ~100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the envelope discovery, the hidden sluice revelation, and the chain measurement, culminating in a tuning that harmonizes competing claims. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist achieves equilibrium and pledges transparent logging, foreclosing further secrecy with conceptual cost legible in "encrypted compassion still needs lungs to become weather." One meaningful deepening occurs when the envelope's residue reveals the forbidden union, reweighting the stakes from simple water allocation to compassion-as-code. Minor causality softness: the child's two appearances feel slightly coincidental rather than causally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the protagonist stands in the attic, feels "a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut," and the final image—"pigeons carry us both ways at once, toward remembering and toward mercy"—reweights the dominant stake (learning to trust) with felt cost (vulnerability, the thinning bookshop, risk of theft). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases via layered images (dust, chips, songs, pigeons) and the pattern of "blooming withering" recurs to charge the ending. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (attic, noon, pigeons, the bookshop context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bookseller announces the attic will be cleared, tightening urgency and forcing the protagonist to act.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early: density builds through wood grain, weather codes, and the terrace's prismatic quality, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator chooses to preserve distance as sacred interval. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (terrace, post-butterfly-effect floodplain, corn maze architect's child). The closure unit—"I kept the distance…the threshold become a companion rather than a wall"—reweights the dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) with conceptual cost (forgoing reunion to maintain the maze's necessary distance). One escalation beat (codes align with grain, seam opens to reveal the scarecrow-father below) deepens understanding and narrows options to descent or preservation. The cost is felt but oblique; the final image of the postponed welcome and the bench "keeping the pattern for whoever comes next" charges the ending without requiring a decisive physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (silt constellations, glass fronds, memory engine) and the closure reconfigures the protagonist's maps from "destinations" to "companions" with a cadence shift in the final lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the algorithm invites rest and the protagonist realizes belonging as shared rhythm. Cost is felt but oblique—the piece signals consent and patience rather than a sharp forfeiture—qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.7)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and interpretive beats toward a thematic conclusion. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—paths close "because the earth was blinking," trust is "the secret architecture under every useful disappearance"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, never felt or foregrounded on the page. Orientation is delayed (cave interior, tools, and task clarify gradually over the first third), and the causal spine is thin: the recollectionist receives a task, listens to glass, follows seeds, sees a vision, and returns with an explanation. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting prior material through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern, detail accretion, and the recursive return of the bishop motif. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (arcade, night, between acts). The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative mode early and maintains it. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final lines crystallize the performer's ongoing dance with chance and care, reweighting "between acts" as the true performance. Cost is conceptual but legible—the protagonist must continuously curate rather than rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the janitor's grief surfaces and the bishop becomes a shared symbol. However, no decisive on-page change narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending restates the premise rather than transforming it, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and maintains spatial coherence in the garden scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tattooing ritual densifies through poetic layering and the final image ("obsidian grace that could pass for ordinary until the next shoulder asked to sing") reconfigures the exile stake into a covert vocation with conceptual cost (living under surveillance, carrying contraband memory). The cost is felt but oblique—the price of continued exile and risk is implied rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the verse completes and the protagonist reframes exile as calling, satisfying the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers pond-stone communion, bay gossip, noctilucent ledger imagery, and the atrium commission into a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors who (glazier), where (Pearl Bay), and when (dawn, before demolition) within the opening lines. The closure unit is Charged Poise: the narrator will "argue for voltage that hums like rain" and "railings polished by hands so no one feels uninvited," crystallizing the stance of rescuing ordinary luminosity within the new structure. Cost is conceptual—the glazier stakes professional credibility on a vision the architect and investor may reject—and the final image ("we were its light first") reweights the atrium as communal memory rather than spectacle. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's stone-throw yields the decision to incorporate old ferry boards, shifting tactics from resistance to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clear by the opening: scarred firefighter on moonlit ridge with porcelain box. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered reflection, object handling, and the mother's arrival, culminating in the shared repair of the paper chain and the agreement to teach children. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of carrying the empty box "calibrating his steps to the heavens" reweights the opening bargain with felt cost—he moves from solitary keeper to collaborative teacher. One meaningful deepening occurs when they unfold and repair the chain together, transforming individual guilt into shared purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The grotto work accumulates pressure through repeated pattern-making, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the gauge holds steady and the protagonist resolves to teach the village. Cost is legible: the protagonist stakes credibility ("Not superstition... but calibration") and commits to ongoing collective work. The closure reweights the opening despair with a serene upheaval made tactile. One meaningful deepening occurs when multiple parallel selves collaborate, narrowing the solution space. Minor slip: the transition from solo experimentation to collective teaching could be more causally grounded in an on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes images (ivy, negative, letter, hopscotch) and the final sigh ("the house rose slightly on its stilts of memory") reweights the premise with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is swift (cartographer, drowned district, post-climate shift), and the single-scene window holds. Cost is oblique—the protagonist accepts the shawl of echoes and promises to return—but the final image of the house rising suggests that the burden is now shared, a conceptual price paid. One deduction: the closure reconfigures meaning but the felt cost is more implied than dramatically visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (terrace, prism, water-studio, mirrors) and the closure reweights the opening pallor/defeat with possibilities ("kitchen with sun," "window instead of curtains"). Orientation anchors who/where/why by the first two paragraphs; the single-scene frame with interiors-as-transition holds legibly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass trembles and shows the dancer's turning, then the narrator's own reaching-out image, reconfiguring the stake from begging instruction to coaxing futures forward. Cost is felt but oblique—no on-page action is foreclosed, only a tonal shift from desperation to steadier breath, which qualifies as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens but leaves the price largely implied rather than concretely demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by line 2 (negotiator, ancient terrace, midsummer). Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual additions (olive branches, lockpicks, red thread, shell casings, lemon water) and cadence shifts (debate → silence → drafting breathing → final vow). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl of casings becomes portable memory, agreements breathe provisionally, the forever war "loosens its grip"—a reweighting with felt cost (annual return, feeding tomorrow, judging by how enemies sleep). One meaningful deepening is clear: moving from distrust and razors of syllables to a shared stance by the sea. Cost is conceptual and social but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual action (tuning fork, speakers, egg's powder release) toward a final image that reweights the protagonist's project. Orientation anchors quickly (salt flat, alone, leather case, distant thunder). The closure—rain arriving as "manufactured, and somehow nearly forgiven"—reconfigures the dominant stake (preserving echoes vs. manufactured drought) with conceptual cost legible in "proof is all echoes ever demand." One meaningful deepening through the egg's transformation satisfies length requirements, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative lens: threads gathered → echoes harvested → looms rethreaded → sleepers wake → bowl returned. One meaningful deepening occurs when the underground looms convert whispers into a counterchant that wakes the city. Cost is conceptual—the city "learns slowly how to refuse and still sing"—but the final image does not make the protagonist's personal price undeniable on the page; the closure reads as thematic repricing without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for the courtesan herself.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dome's hush and the story stick accumulate pressure toward the woman's arrival and her reweighting of the puppet show's ethics. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator learns to follow rather than lead—but the cost is asserted ("uncommonly serene…because I had finally learned") rather than made visceral on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The tightening from argument to invitation to opening night reads as deepening, satisfying the lens, but the final image lacks a sharp felt price that would elevate the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered signals (reeds, pebbles, pollen, moth wing, fern stems) and the monarch's arrival. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator promises to "stitch their names from moss and echo" and the monarch blesses the method, crystallizing the stance. Cost is felt (the vulnerability of temporary structures, the weight of witnessing extinction) but remains somewhat oblique; the final image of lying in stillness does not decisively reweight prior material with unmistakable pressure. One meaningful deepening is present.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence build toward the final triangle of bells that speak names. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist stays, listens, and accepts the ongoing task with visible cost (exhaustion, sleep on the floor). Orientation is late (furnace/sanctum/aurora anchored ~15% in; "icebound sanctum" named only at line 3). The lens holds and closure lands with felt cost, but early disorientation and the slight cost-visibility gap (weariness implied more than shown) keep this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Foresight Hindsight Only), where (vine-draped bunker), and when (storm approaches) within the first ~100 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered dream-translation, wafer-seal breaking, and archive dialogue until the final door opening reweights "directive" into "invitation" with visible cost (the bunker exhales, satisfied; the name stops being a maze). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist steps through with "ethereal grit, precisely playful," and the cost is legible in the transition from captive to chosen walker. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archive remembers "to shepherd," narrowing the path's meaning and the protagonist's role.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator writes their name in faint strokes, pledges scarce resources, and accepts stewardship "without grandeur," forecloses spectacle with visible cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through overlaid schematics, converging arcs, wire alignments, water channels—and the cadence shift at "The room exhaled" reweights the dominant stake (to seal a covenant with maintenance, not power). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dusk, courtyards, palace reimagined as observatory) and causality holds under the accumulative lens; the final pledge is motivated by prior particulars (the tile, the alcove, the disk). One hairline concern: the urn-and-disk sequence introduces multiple nested objects in quick succession, risking slight reader lag, but each step is motivated and the closure image ("thrift…keeps its end of quiet") charges prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (narrator), where (sanctuary), and what (Rell's arrival) by the first paragraph; the piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early through lyric patterning and metaphor density. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Rell's resentment loosens, he receives the box, the narrator feels the unsung melody)—the final image reweights prior material and the cost is felt in the narrator's solitude and Rell's departure carrying the broken pin. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rell's cellular memory opens the factory corridor and he gathers his mother's breath, narrowing his stance from blame to forgiveness. Causality is impressionistic but coherent under the accumulative lens; the sanctuary's mechanics (shifting grace, soundless music) remain abstract yet stable.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes early stakes (capture the dream before it tears the district loose), and the corridor-building sequence accumulates pressure through synchronized breathing beats that narrow focus from orchard rows to the chipped lens to the final glint. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the dream settles into the hammock-glint, boundaries soften where harshness had pretended to be order, and the orchard exhales—a reweighting of "capture" into "care" with visible spatial consequence (fog seam bright as glass mountains). Cost is conceptual and relational rather than visceral: fences do not all return, cruel edges soften. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Ilen, orchard district, twilight frost, Noor waiting). One meaningful deepening occurs when the corridor wobbles and Ilen steadies the rhythm, teaching the dream to listen rather than thrash. The accumulative method holds; the ending reconfigures the premise with felt restraint rather than declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the narrator leaves the tin unopened, grafts with the ribbon, and the orchard's deciduous vows resume—a final image that reweights prior refusal with visible emotional and relational cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through ritual beats, leaf-shedding, and the bell ringing with the ribbon, then the final image crystallizes the generational bridge. Orientation is swift (cathedral, orchard, breach-of-contract context by line 2). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. The cost is legible: the father waits rather than forces contact, forecloses reunion on his terms. No causality breaks. High-band entry tests met (Q2 criterion, lens held, cost on-page), but the Cost proof test shows the ribbon-graft and unopened-tin lines carry the cost; pointing to "I left the tin unopened, because sometimes a father must wait" confirms felt price, satisfying the 8.5+ gate without reaching 9.0 due to slight abstraction in the explanatory clause.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words we have "astral orchard" and "lonely asteroid" but no clear temporal or spatial anchors for the curator's movements until the bathroom pod appears. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (cameo warming, grove closing, pages turning)—and a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when he presses the cameo into the tree and accepts his role to "curate the between." However, the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page; the final smile and silver pod invitation feel more like lyric closure than a lived price. Minor orientation debt and the abstract quality of the final reconfiguration prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within opening lines; the pattern of gap-reading and diary-navigation is taught early and recurs. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the apprentice is found and the library opens, providing Resonant Reconfiguration (the relief of being allowed to err). However, cost remains oblique: no concrete forfeiture or foreclosed path is legible on the page at closure—"gentler futures from the overlooked" reads as conceptual comfort rather than felt price. The mosaic structure (travel through caverns, lamplighter encounter, apprentice rescue, summit arrival) holds coherent pressure but the final image diffuses stakes rather than crystallizing them with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the carnival ship and fog establish place immediately. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (carousel, funhouse, ferris wheel, prize room) toward a final reconfiguration when the protagonist releases the jar and the garden "spelt nothing, which was everything." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the self "unclasped," one identity relinquished), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible on the page. The "narrative threads" method and recursive "as memories alter" refrain teach a pattern, yet causality stays loose: the card's mechanics (how green reflections "mapped constellations") and the garden's arrival feel convenience-driven rather than motivated by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (gaps, rope braids, seal impression) that converge at closure when the ledger is corrected and the doorway "gentled back to an honest wall." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—absence translated into presence, confusion into clarity—with conceptual cost legible in the final image ("bridges are only doors that learned to stay"). One minor slip: the causal link between rope reconfiguration and doorway behavior reads metaphorical rather than mechanically grounded, slightly softening the felt necessity of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, fragment-sentences, hammered images—and holds it cleanly through closure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the bloom closes, the beings learn where to be quiet, the mapkeeper commits to tending the pattern with stone and chart. Cost is legible on the page—sustained vigilance, the map now a responsibility, the ongoing need to read ice—and the final image reweights the opening premise without moralizing. One meaningful deepening (the bloom's planting and the beings' softening) tightens the dominant stake under the accumulative lens. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough for comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational accents. The piece accumulates layered particulars (star paths, prism, shard, Lio's map) toward a tightening at the repair and rekindling that reweights the opening isolation into communal belonging. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise leaning toward Earned Stasis)—the protagonist remains custodian, the pavilion "sang us forward," and the cost is oblique but present in "the silence between hums I heard purpose click into place." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The accumulation is purposeful, though the final third leans toward summary ("By morning the dunes shook with feet") rather than a single decisive image, softening the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator's stance deepens through layered imagery (monoliths, forecourt, quill) and a cadence shift at the plum revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to integration): the narrator steps into the forecourt, shares personal memory, and earns a place in the archive with visible cost (vulnerability, the "temporary seam"). Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the timeframe "after fog becomes solid" is poetic but legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator moves from observer to participant, reweighting prior doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through mosaic imagery (note in mosaic → fireworks sequence → ash-drinking blooms) with a coherent pattern taught early. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the knot re-tied and walls rechanted, reweighting the opening hopelessness with "what remained possible." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The weakness: cost is conceptual and felt rather than a visible forfeiture on the page—the keeper stands straighter, vines tremble, but no trade-off or sacrifice forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening (discovery of the knot and collaborative performance) narrows options under the lens, meeting the 600–800 word requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (tidal-pool chronicler), where (ancient grotto), and the relationship stakes early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered reflection, future visions, and the pause itself, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The narrator's "Yes" at closure reweights the pause from hesitation to hinge, and the final image ("arch had formed, patient, exact, and finally passable") crystallizes the transformation with felt cost (leaving the coast, redefining identity). Cost is legible in "to extend it" and "learning new littorals"—renunciation of the familiar shoreline is clear. One meaningful deepening (the cicada's metaphor applied to the relationship choice) suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece gathers varieties of silence through a catalogue structure, then deepens when the protagonist shares one with her father, reweighting safety from "blast doors" to "home." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of redrawing entrances together, with the doll cooling as "a small heart learning new beats," reconfigures the father's bunker logic and the daughter's understanding of openings. Orientation anchors early (bunker builder's child, monthly gravity inversion, trellis). The cost is conceptual and relational—the protagonist risks her own safety ("too much gilded hush and I stop wanting doors") and bridges her father's concrete world with her own sensory one, visible in his softened blueprints and the collaborative redesign.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory particulars (storm glass crystals, train whistles, felt-wrapped notes) and builds through pattern repetition toward a final cadence shift where "the motion now is kin to rest." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mathematician's transition from computational analysis to embodied presence, crystallized in "the not speaking is not a wall but a window," with the conceptual cost of abandoning proof-seeking legible in her closing her eyes and ceasing calculation. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The tightening is modest—one meaningful deepening when she stops computing angles—but sufficient for this length and lens. Cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early—mythic quest mapped through lyric fragments—and escalates via density increase (rumor → waterfall → orchard → mural-peel → hatch → stairway → throne chamber). Orientation anchors arrive by ~100 words (Halo Nine, lore keeper, Quin, sunrise deadline, throne). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist refuses singular rule, negotiates a duet, and leaves the throne empty; the final image ("apples exhale their messages, all those unrealized futures turning into seeds we could finally plant") reweights the premise with conceptual cost (sovereignty deferred, options preserved). Cost is legible but oblique: the throne remains unclaimed, governance is shared and seasonal, and the city "settle[s] into a kinder rhythm" rather than achieving decisive power. One persistent ambiguity: the "stairway of ascension" is discovered but then inverts ("did not rise; it inverted, spiraling down"), which poetically suggests ascent-as-descent but could confuse readers expecting spatial coherence; the piece does not signal this inversion early enough to teach the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure—stepping aside so the girl "could cross unescorted"—functions as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the narrator's solitude and the ritualized waiting). The cost is legible on the page ("that was the prayer I wanted"), and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the student places her palm on the narrator's, linking through scars, which reweights the earlier solitary stance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered imagery (bolt, promise, ghostly texts, diamond-bearing mushrooms) and a decisive cadence shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words; the compression chamber crisis deepens once meaningfully when the narrator installs the bolt and "signs" their name, crystallizing responsibility with visible consequence (diamonds bloom, ledger dissolves). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of reflection "briefly tidal and new" and the delivered crate reconfigure the opening scars and pyramid-scheme past into generative trust. Cost is legible in the refusal to patent ("only payable in trust and lungs") and the voluntary charity action that follows acceptance of the raise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist ratifies the dynasty's pre-planned ending and transforms it from shame into mercy, forecloses restoration with visible cost (seal abandonment, crank as gavel). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph ("dynasty ender," "sepia reading room," "first yawn of evening"). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layers of ash-writing, gramophone mechanics, and sensory density build toward the final cadence shift where "dynasty ender" reprices to "finally beginning." One meaningful deepening occurs when the confession rewrites the protagonist's understanding of the fall, altering stance with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (withdrawn knight, alchemical orchard greenhouse) land early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (stage directions, constellation-trees, mother's script) and culminates in the kernel choice that reweights possibility into "homecoming." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the knight chooses one shape of possibility, and the cost (drowning in "statistics of miracles" if he does not choose) is legible. One minor friction: the orchard's mechanics (how grafts cultivate shapes of possibility) remain abstract, relying on atmospheric accumulation rather than dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds pressure through dust-reading, the button discovery, file review, and addendum-writing; each beat deepens the archivist's engagement with Micah's unknown fate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of dust "composing tomorrow's map" reweights the archive from cavern to corridor, with the cost legible in "my heart still hurt" and the vulnerability of waiting. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (archivist, file room, before fluorescents flicker). One meaningful tightening occurs when the button's discovery transforms record-keeping into active hope.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric patterning, and the final image attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise ("the hinge, the turn, the steady hum"). However, the Orientation Test fails: who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word threshold, with "the night," "a quiet clerk," and "the museum" offering insufficient spatial and temporal anchors. The closure unit—voices returning to the lagoon and captions beginning to "sweat"—implies cost but does not show a visible forfeiture or alteration of Mara's options on the page. Escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads accumulative/textural: each prophetic line forms, the protagonist intervenes with sound, the sentence stutters or fogs over, and pressure accretes through repetition with cadence shifts ("A second line descends, colder…"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis: the protagonist leaves with the oath still held and the absence made visible, a refusal that forecloses completion of the prophecy with felt cost (eerie nostalgia persists, memory smells of ash). The cost is legible in the final image of the withdrawn mist and the carried instrument, though the price is oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (orderly seed sorter, skyborne arbor, hush timeframe). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered image and ritual, culminating in the insight "what emerges transformed always is the hearer." However, the closure unit—while philosophically resonant—lacks a visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page; the narrator's role and stance remain unchanged, and no prior option is foreclosed. The final laugh and descent feel celebratory rather than charged with sacrifice or renunciation, making the RR incomplete under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, shifting from fragmented search to immersive discovery to integration. Orientation anchors by line 3 (workshop ruins, city context). The piece moves through discrete pressure beats—finding the compass, following it, entering the greenhouse, descending, reading the journal, building the water clock—each adding density and reweighting the dominant stake (how to repair time/clocks after failure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes a new stance ("hours that refuse cages") with conceptual cost (abandoning precision for flow). The lyric mode teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure. One persistent constraint (the waterfall's rhythm) shapes the climactic act. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the old method and the commitment to "improvise."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator tempers grief into balanced remembrance with concrete cost ("heavier without gaining mass"). The accumulative/textural lens holds: each alchemical step deepens the dominant stake (redemption through measurement). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cup test reveals names have mass, narrowing options toward the fusion act. Cost is legible in "I am not healed, but I am held together."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and motif density increase toward the ending, where the woman's laughter "braids with the river's recollection" and climbs "the harp's crooked ladder." Orientation anchors who and where early (lost soul collector, echo gorge), though "when" remains vague beyond "hidden sunrise." The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's departure charged by prior listening work), but cost is implied rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint follows her release, only atmospheric brightening. The harp and crocodile's tooth recur with shifted meaning, meeting the Accumulative requirement, but the final "benediction of bent music" asserts resolution without an exact sentence proving cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes Accumulative/Textural mode through ultraviolet forest imagery and proprioceptive mapping. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the prose teaches its lyric pattern. However, the closure—etching the rule on bark and carrying the forest inward—reads as Conceptual Repricing without a legible cost on the page; the protagonist simply walks away enriched, not diminished. The "mathematics of mercy" is asserted rather than derived through on-page constraint or sacrifice, and the final turn does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the market stroll, lens ritual, and name recovery build density toward a final image where speaking the child's name reweights the painting's anonymity with felt cost ("suddenly the scene quit drowning in anonymity"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the name's return charges the frame and steadies the market wind), cost is relational and conceptual (the painter "lowered his eyes, hearing what he had hidden"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~90 words without penalty. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the lens "tasted the light" and fed coordinates, deepening the ritual's stakes. Minor elision: the precise mechanism of how letters "rose like fish" is lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist releases the trapped hours, the room "seems lighter by the weight it lost," and the act forecloses further haunting with visible cost ("slipped the mainspring barrel into my tool bag…as a receipt"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—dust patterns, ceiling details, and the coiled steel build pressure that the unwinding releases. Orientation anchors (abandoned ticket office, ghost-arguing elevator tech) arrive promptly, and the escalation (discovery → engagement → release) tightens options under the chosen lens without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a decisive final choice. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (glass books, negotiable reality, wobble-as-law) and accumulates pressure through frost-script, whisper-release, and the library's creaking response. Closure lands on-page: printing the compressed moment tastes perfection, the library stills, then rejects stasis and resumes motion—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wobble-law reasserted) with conceptual cost legible in "Perfection...weighed more than buoyancy." Orientation anchors (operator, press, glass orchard, cloud sea) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the whisper "lined the type" and the operator commits to the clause.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the shard's "breathing" accumulates meaning through ritual, public reading, council demonstration, then fractures. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): "my revolution remained defunct...but the civilization we shared looked different in the light" + final crack embodies visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; causality flows cleanly from discovery through method to adjudication. One meaningful deepening (shard song → council revision) with felt cost at closure satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shadow steps away, the covenant shifts from rust-as-theft to rust-as-patina, and light returns tethered to listening rather than ownership—visible cost (shadowless labor) and a coherent reweighting under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causality is legible: confession steadies → chip resonates → shadow trades → light binds to attention. Orientation anchors (chamber, city dimmed three rotations, repairman's craft) arrive early. One friction: the midpoint threading of mechanics ("stitching futures before they fray") reads more as assertion than dramatized constraint, but the closure image pays off the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator sits with the lagoon, releases scent-memory, and the cave opens a ledge with scarf—an awakening that pivots on love and courage rather than explanation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through psychometry flashes, scent releases, and hinged openings until the final ledge discovery reweights all prior delving. The cost is legible in the line "some awakenings hinge on love, and the door they open leads only back to courage"—a renunciation of mechanistic answers with felt grief. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length and the closure image (scarf, ledge, chalk mark) charges prior motifs without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (GPS failure → storm → lantern slide → gate construction) and ends with a Resonant Reconfiguration (vow to build bridges). Closure is legible as Charged Poise: the protagonist crystallizes a stance with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (breakwater, skiff, archway). The main issue: the cartographer's words and the slide's instructions remove protagonist struggle, flattening the escalation into a guided tutorial rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered perception (glass, postcards, scent) that culminates in the pavilion moment where grandmother's final card reweights all prior material. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "my murals were doors" crystallizes the threshold between artist and ancestor with conceptual cost (the work is no longer solely hers). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (studio, cathedral, winter). One meaningful deepening occurs when the draft carries tobacco scent and the mural unfolds inside the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (zeppelin → shore → lagoon → reverie → return) and maintains legible transitions. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archivist remains partially trapped yet walks forward, the city learning to read itself—a reconfiguration with felt cost made visible in "half-retrocognitively trapped" and the ongoing embodiment of courage. Orientation anchors (archivist, zeppelin, coast) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the clerk descends with stenograph punches, unlocking suppressed testimony and narrowing options toward public record. The cost is conceptual and relational (officials face signatures, the archivist carries permanent split presence), legible in the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles a mosaic of acts—lighting lanterns, writing charters, ringing the bell—that increase density and shift cadence toward collective action by the end. Orientation anchors who (Iria), where (paper-lantern cove), and when (after the last wish) within the opening lines. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the faint ticking in the amber bottle and the phrase "no one needed wishes anymore" reweight prior material with conceptual cost (the end of miracles, the start of labor). The cost is felt in the shift from magic to sweat, though the final image is more asserted than viscerally shown.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (oath scribe), where (rooftop orchard), and the dominant stake (whether to record a harmful prophecy) by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered memory, basin ritual, and prophecy emergence until the final renunciation reconfigures the orchard's fruit and the child's breath with felt cost (unarchived work, professional departure). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): refusal to record forecloses the scribe's usual path and shelters the child, paying off the harbor-tower setup. One persistent weakness: the prophecy arrives via voice-from-tomorrow without clear mechanics taught early, creating a small causality gap that doesn't break closure but leaves the "how" slightly magical rather than method-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual beats—egg hatching, naming, placement of the cap, journey through seasons—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the protagonist plants the cap and commits to teaching the next keeper). The cost is legible in the line "when it loosens, I will teach the next pair of hands the song," foreclosing permanent possession. One tightening occurs when Return "pours a draft of invisible pollen" and the protagonist sees the orchard unborn, reweighting the task from storage to transmission. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (release rather than hoarding) under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's decision to favor listening over noise alters the storm's trajectory and reweights the sanctuary's function with visible social cost ("we had switched our posture"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases through layered images (glue drying, rope memory, bell echo) that converge at the ending to reconfigure the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (windblown sanctuary, solstice night, console) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the corridor "faltered, split, and sidled away" under attentive observation, narrowing options and confirming the tactical shift. Cost is legible on the page: the ferryman's clock depends on the bell, not the siren grid, and the valley station's question ("asked if we had switched the grid") underscores the institutional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (stardust, lantern glass, meteors, stillness) that reweight the dominant stake by the ending. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist's stance crystallizes in the final image ("the station and I entered a flourishing stillness again, not empty, but full of spared collision"), reweighting prior material with felt cost—the long wait, the cracked heart, the choice to honor an old boundary rather than chase. One meaningful deepening occurs when the power fails and the protagonist speaks the engineers' names, unlocking the station's trust and revealing the meteor corridor. However, the final reversal (meteors angling away, respecting the boundary) leans slightly passive—the protagonist's attention and honoring choice enable it, but the causality of the meteors' response feels more mystical than tightly motivated, reducing tension in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (shimmering ghosts, daily ritual, archive logic) and sustains it through deepening—each object placed in the box reweights the covenant until the queen's arrival forces a reckoning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): opening the hidden panel and marking the hexagon crystallizes his role as custodian with conceptual cost legible in "the archive accepted the burden without smoldering." Orientation anchors (recluse, apiary wasteland, post-catastrophe) arrive within the first 100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the queen gestures to the box asking "if its archive could hold heat"—the question narrows his options from passive witness to active participant who must answer for his complicity. Cost is visible: the tolerable bee stings that "thread the present to the archive" and the hexagon sigil that commits him to indefinite custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and what early enough; the piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by the second paragraph and holds it cleanly through closure. The capsule discovery → Lio's arrival → collaborative walking/reading → childhood memory recovery → communal calendar-building sequence shows clear causal linkage and one meaningful deepening when the footprint-letter unlocks the narrator's forgotten pulse-listening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator opts to remain in wonder-timed waiting with visible cost—abandoning numerical certainty—and the final cricket/boot posting reweights the opening silo task. Cost is conceptual and felt but not physically dramatized, which keeps the score from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet's philosophy of tending incompleteness is seeded early, tested when the boy loses his kite, and deepened through the ritual of writing and raft-building. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy runs to his mother "spool light in his palm, ribbonless yet tethered to a new listening," crystallizing his shift from loss to attentive presence. The cost is oblique—he does not recover the kite, and the poet's final line "lets the ink say less than silence can" signals renunciation of complete articulation. One meaningful deepening (the boy's chest evens, birds resume) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (island caretaker, temple orchard, morning) land early; the piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% through layered sensory detail and recurring motifs (copper, diary, pillars). Closure reads as Earned Stasis: the protagonist completes the remodel and lies down, returning to "the woven map we had made" with visible cost (exhaustion, the winding of the final copper circle, the diary left beneath the oak). Cost is legible but oblique—the ending offers resonance over sharp sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orchard begins to respond (pillars shading seedlings, oaks leaning), tightening the protagonist's commitment. The late communal shift (council, otters, neighbors) introduces new material without clear escalation, diluting singular pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, ceremonial pattern early (rainwashed tower, convergence, basin ritual) and accumulates sensory and conceptual density toward the window-touch closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (tower, spring, post-contact). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via the metaphor "home is a rate constant"—a conceptual repricing that reweights the pilgrimage premise—but the cost remains oblique: no specific renunciation or trade-off is named on the page, only a shift in understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the amber touch triggers the scent and pulse, narrowing the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (reef death, battlefield reclamation, dead languages, bird-guided planting) and the final image reconfigures the jetty as "narrow as mercy," reweighting the opening "narrow vastness." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the garden's hold quiets ghosts without dismissing them—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific forfeiture. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "after the reef dies" provides temporal context without dramatic urgency. The piece coheres under its lens but the ending image, while charged, lacks a sharp visible or felt price that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the relay conversation and sister's message reweight distance with felt relational cost and the final walk back delivers Harbor's nodding acknowledgment that scars speak in colors. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred early (poetic density, sensory layering) and holds through the lyric ending. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift: market riddle unlocks cylinder method, dusk ritual charges the relay, and the exchange reconfigures the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (Sluice, scrapyard, narrator-I-Harbor). One micro turn (vendor's riddle) sets up closure without introducing a second decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist constructs a "navigable field where confusion once thrashed" through layered sketches, establishing a vein of intention as true north. Cost is conceptual and felt—she accepts the pariah role, transforms solitary drawing into devotion, and meets dawn "with steady eyes" after refusing perfection. Orientation is prompt (deck, post-shutdown context anchored by ~100 words). One meaningful deepening: the compass rose shifts from ornament to four-armed map (past/present/elsewhere/return), reweighting the anniversary custom and foreclosing drift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: the board "inhales" the wrongness out, mountains return, and the sky is amended—a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the protagonist has bound themselves to future travel and mending). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the sequence of chess-piece swaps that each release weather knotted to memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the queen reveals a letter addressed to the protagonist before birth, reweighting the stakes from mechanical repair to existential vocation. However, orientation is delayed—"who" is clear early, but "where" (inside the spire corridor) and "when" (sky is wrong, but no temporal anchor) are diffuse until the chessboard beat, pushing past the ~120-word guideline without clear payoff for the delay; apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered walking-spelling rituals, and the final image of following the nomadic penumbra reweights the opening's "luminous absence." Orientation anchors are present by the first paragraph (whispering gallery, interregnum timeframe, crisis actor turned historian). Closure takes the form of Conceptual Repricing—the narrator will "travel with the nomadic penumbra, following where small gestures shine"—which reconfigures the stakes from archiving to becoming part of the transient record. The cost is conceptual (leaving only objects behind, becoming ungoverned) rather than viscerally felt, and the final beat's assertion "They will think I vanished" tells more than it shows, but the lens holds and the pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (bookstore, mountain, narrator seeking the seer). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist speaks "my first true hello" and the mountain answers, reweighting home as practice rather than place. Cost is conceptual—burying the accent forfeited talents—but the final image makes the reconfiguration undeniable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone triggers the courtyard vision and the narrator confronts the buried accent. Minor deduction: the seer's nightly "substitution" introduces a reality-warping mechanism that complicates but does not causally enable the closure, adding texture without tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal escalation at closure. Orientation anchors (exiled chess tutor, time-frozen village, fountain square) land cleanly by ~100 words. The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early and maintains coherent pressure: each thread loosened returns a fraction of time, building density until the protagonist chooses incremental release over brilliant sacrifice. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—the tutor accepts the longer pedagogical method, visible cost paid in rejecting satisfying catharsis. The cost is legible: "I left only the clocktower pigeons still as thoughts, so that I might always remember that some flights must wait for weather." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (towers, spire, artist arrives with satchel). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the canyon redefines the price from voice-theft to shared color-fragments, and the artist surrenders "the gold of his mentor's last morning" with visible release. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's dividing chant disperses the doubled price into many. Cost is legible in the color-giving and the artist's unclench. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors early: workshop, acid sea, alchemist present. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered tactile beats (measurements, bell-humming, soldering) until the final image reweights the opening promise with audible cost—"low music keeps me from the edge." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the engine speaks, names the pattern, and the protagonist commits to tomorrow's work with "sharpened hope," forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: "She did not give me her, but it gives me the pattern of her choosing." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with Resonant Reconfiguration: the painter completes the hidden promise by adding "a single curve" and then leaves, forecloses living in the painting, and returns to the quay transformed. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—layered images (mirror crack, shell, pool, corridor) cohere and reweight at the ending when the painter "paints the harbor as it inhales and exhales, once and forever." Causality is motivation-driven rather than plot-mechanical, but the progression holds: cracked mirror → cave entry → oasis reveal → corridor opens → single brushstroke → voluntary exit. Orientation is swift (studio above harbor, quay painter, cracked mirror) and the cost—refusing to stay—charges the final image without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly (cobalt lighthouse, dawn, assistant keeper) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the freighter captain's salute and the mentor's silent acknowledgment crystallize the narrator's stance, reweighting "screaming tenderness" with felt cost (vulnerability, the mentor's exhausted concession). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent-beckoning succeeds and the mentor witnesses the hum. Cost is legible in the mentor's muttered concession and the narrator's sustained vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (station → phone calls → inland journey → shelter) with clear transitions and a coherent lens throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist commits to perpetual reverse migration—"ready to build the next necessary mercy"—foreclosing recovery with visible cost ("the path we etched will hold like a seam"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first two paragraphs. One pressure point: the beacon shifts from sweeping to pointing, narrowing the navigator's route and forcing the inland journey. Cost is legible in the final stanza: the station will dim, the pulse will famish, but the ache is now mapped as route, not destination.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and cadence shift—opening with ravine and orchard threat, layering the smuggled eye and textbook method, tensing with the patrol encounter, and closing with the girl's unburdening and the group's collective endurance. Closure reads as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: "we learned to breathe while it looked at us from the keeper, and the orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured" registers visible cost (the unresolved pain, the precarious orchard) and forecloses easy remedy. Orientation anchors early (hanging orchard, ravine, post-empathy-virus world, truffle forager). One deduction: the inspector encounter resolves slightly too easily—they "shrugged" and left after full disclosure of contraband without dramatized consequence, reducing friction at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through layered observation (notch, chevrons, borrowed memory) and deepens when the keeper decodes the inversion ("the signal runs both ways"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he sweeps the notch, writes the name, holds the promise "that can be borrowed but not owned"—with felt cost in the permanent witness duty. The orientation is clear by the opening beat (keeper, dock, twilight), and the final lantern-swing and ledger act reweight all prior material without resort to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors early (map dealer, shop, midsummer approach). Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through years of stillness, the rebuilt bridge, ant-following, cavern discovery, and the hallway of reflections. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist removes the chip and crosses the creek, crystallizing options with felt cost ("promise had not ended; it had finished transforming"). The walk-out and creek-crossing supply visible consequence. One hairline issue: the hallway-of-mirrors segment risks exposition, but the final image reweights prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "queen," "palace," "mountains" in the opening, but spatial anchors drift (orchards, ridge, ledges, pool) without stable choreography until the cobalt grotto. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—images and motifs (bleeding starlight, moth/flame, crescent key) accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure attempts Charged Poise: the queen "unstitch[es]" and the starlight pool "stopped bleeding, calm as an eye that had decided to watch." However, the cost is not legible on the page; we're told she wears dreams "like a ring that remembered every finger," but what she renounces or forfeits remains abstract. The wanderer's departure and the pool's calm offer atmospheric closure, not a visible decision or price.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the "thimble of light" proves "presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry," reweighting the opening dare. Orientation anchors (ember nexus, two friends, twilight) land early. However, the escalation reads as accumulative texture rather than a tightening that narrows options; the experiment proceeds without meaningful reversal or complication. Cost is conceptual (the secret "not endangered anymore") but felt cost—what was risked or forfeited—remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered dream logic, the scroll's dates "loop backward, forward, sideways," and the final image reweights the opening grave with the narrator packing the scroll and patrolling forward. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—the narrator accepts chronological confusion and continues without resurrection, forecloses correction with felt cost ("let the narrative soar somewhere just ahead, dragging you kindly"). One meaningful deepening when the dream-flight over the grave transforms the stones into question marks. Cost is legible in the choice to walk forward after one's own funeral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the repaired clepsydra pulses with "new humility," the father cradles time as metaphor for birth, and the text message confirms the trio's arrival, reweighting the opening stake ("unveil ordinary miracles") with felt cost in the screw's irreplaceability and the father's released fear. Orientation anchors (narrator, shop, morning fog) land cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the midwife's screw fits the broken clock, converting inherited grief into present function. The accumulative texture—drips as vowels, ripples as lenses, breath as permission—coheres through the ending, but cost remains oblique (more conceptual than visceral on the page).

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered ceremonial moves early and holds it to closure. Orientation is swift (floating platform, rune scholar, tea rite). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final drink and settling of runes reweights the scars with felt cost—breath exhaustion and the embodied act of ingestion carry pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs as each rune is drawn and the breath-hold tightens. Cost is legible in "my breath thunders in its cage" and the final swallow, though the cost could be more viscerally foregrounded in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who: gossip columnist/exorcist; where: sheet music archive; when: night before orchard cutting). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression; the closure operates as Charged Poise—the imperfect nocturne played while the foreman curses represents a crystallized stance with felt cost (career risk, incomplete reunion). The lens holds and the final image reweights prior metaphors (imperfect miracles, coastal-town forgiveness) without stated resolution. Cost is legible in the foreman call and the "clumsy" performance that remains "ours."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the spiral walk accumulates pressure through density increase and pattern layering, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator shifts from "end" to "hinge," a stance crystallization with conceptual cost visible in the margin note revision). Orientation anchors arrive early (temple library, dictionary, spiral mosaic) and the lens holds through closure. The cost is legible in the reweighting of the task and the acknowledgment that certainty must be given away, though the conceptual price is more oblique than felt—no path is visibly foreclosed, only redefined.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, image recurrence—and holds it cleanly to closure. Orientation anchors appear by line 2 (fjord station, night watch, hydraulic clocks). Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: "not to pace minutes but to shepherd edges" reweights the premise with felt cost (the bleeding finger, the uncorrected boundary event). The stylus-knit-darkness final image crystallizes the reconfigured understanding. One escalation point (Basin Three lag → backward counting → blood-marked key → conceptual shift) suffices for this textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist leaves with the theorem stub, waiting for the bus to tell her father "his system had finally done some good," and the line "I felt the odds change, mercifully and slowly" crystallizes a reweighted stance with conceptual cost (accepting his legacy, forgoing pure rejection). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: details and motifs (lantern, subway scrawls, rain, Martingale) layer toward the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive early (library at midsummer, post-heart-attack frame, narrator identity). Minor deduction: the subway-scrawl navigation mechanic is set up but its literal traversal in the library alcove feels slightly convenience-plotted rather than purely causal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (Rojo Tuesdays, Flora's night calls) and deepens through the emergency-line crisis that crystallizes Mara's method. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she records the night, resumes her stance, and the final image—"endings walked down the stairs...Mara stayed standing"—reweights her cultivated estrangement with conceptual cost (permanent separation). Orientation anchors arrive within the first two lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the third rail arcs and she must route the child through her network, raising the stakes of her estrangement practice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (locket, thermos, jetty bloom) and the archivist's ritual compresses memory into present anchors. The reunion arrives as situational coincidence (footsteps at dusk) rather than causally earned by the woman's or archivist's prior moves, weakening the closure's felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (jetty, archivist role, woman with locket). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (couple's ladder rebuilt through proximate causes) with thematic cost legible in the archivist's sealing act, though the coincidental timing prevents full 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (disused station, ivy, chalk). The piece accumulates density through layered images and recursive motifs (moon rock, rumor, postcards) that converge at the trolley's arrival and the logistician's quiet exit. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the logistician withdraws after the system sustains itself, a renunciation with conceptual cost legible in "quietly mislaid their own name." The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, and the accumulative pattern holds without contradiction through the ending image of the station as "a ledger of kindness disguised as light."

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory metaphors and reflective loops toward a thematic reconfiguration at the stillpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first third. However, the closure unit—"The stillpoint is not escape but axis"—is stated rather than dramatized, and cost remains conceptual without a specific forfeited path or altered tactic on the page. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final image ("night steps with me") reiterates theme without reweighting prior material through a concrete choice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors by line 10 (station, Quiet, role). The story teaches a pattern of contingent editing early ("We do not receive; we edit") and pays it off when the protagonist's terraced lines interfere with the broadcast to produce seed shipments dated months ago. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: history has been edited, the cost is the protagonist's acceptance of uncertain agency ("maybe us, maybe the Quiet, maybe the treaty within me"), and the final image reweights the premise without stating a moral. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from passive listening to active inscription, narrowing options and altering knowledge. Cost is legible in the addendum and the protagonist's shift to "still confident enough to bear it."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of lyric imagery building toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is present by ~120 words (harbor, pier, Arin). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Arin walks home having "tuned" memory by mapping silence, with the promise to carry the song forward—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than sharp. The final bow and walk feel like graceful exit rather than a stakes-reweighting moment with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: a trail of artistic clues accumulates toward a final thematic reconfiguration where the arson becomes "primer" and the city a "vow kept." Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "after going off the grid" remains vague in duration and consequence. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the seeds write names onto wind, reweighting the arson as preservation—but the cost (what the protagonist forfeits or risks by planting seeds in a ruin) is asserted rather than dramatically legible. One tightening occurs when the tapestry fragment aligns with the canvas gouge, opening the stair, but subsequent beats feel like successive revelations without narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres under accumulative pressure—drumming, sensory layering, and the lagoon ritual intensify until the final image of Mira's awakening and the narrator's acceptance of the donors reweights the stakes with undeniable cost. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "We would not return to before, but we would honor the after by learning its music" crystallizes options and reconfigures meaning with felt pressure. Orientation anchors (experimental wing, narrator perched on rails, nighttime ritual) arrive within the opening lines; spatial choreography (garden, lagoon, ward, Mira's bed) remains legible across transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat (night, geomagnetic storm, port labyrinth, Ivo's rounds). The causal lens holds: Ivo accepts Rade's challenge, applies his brass-key whisper method, the courier responds, and the gate opens through the zodiac coin's vibration-sensing use—each step narrows options and raises the wager's cost. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rade's surrender and question crystallize the lesson without resolving the larger storm or port chaos, and the cost is relational (authority ceded). One meaningful tightening (challenge accepted → whisper deployed → courier found) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator refuses the brother's "old pull" and the final walk together reweights the opening isolation with conceptual cost (the city "felt slightly less alone" implies ongoing work, not resolution). Accumulative lens is taught early (rain, mirror flickers, shutter sequences build density) and holds through the ending image. Orientation anchors cobalt dock, post-rain, and two figures by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator receives the mirror and turns light toward the drowned arches, shifting from witness to agent. Cost is legible: "my voice returned like floodwater, slow and brown, carrying what was lost to banks again."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (mist, benches, library as recurring anchors) and attempts closure through a pattern of slowing and reflection. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words—but the mist/library frame eventually pays off, so I waive the Orientation Test penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the town "cradles questions"), yet the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; I cannot point to a single on-page sentence where a specific price is paid or a live option foreclosed. The final image ("leaves promising shade") reweights the opening but lacks the sharpness required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, image-dense pattern early and sustains it; the final crossing constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the protagonist's self-naming crystallizes the island and unlocks the community's approach. Cost is present in the line "the one without hardshell, the one that bends like sunlight on scales"—a renunciation of protective identity. Orientation is legible by ~100 words (dock, island, coast setting, single POV). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scrimshaw "rang" and the whale's call answered, tightening the stakes toward the crossing. The closure reconfigures the opening restraint motif ("even the waves learn restraint") into active tenderness ("to love with seawater still drying in our hair"), charging prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of narrated performance layered with private resistance; closure arrives when the protagonist names the distinction on-camera ("not joy, but lightness") and the remade hush "held with it." Cost is conceptual and social—risking inspectorate scrutiny by articulating the unstated. The final beat reweights the dominant stake (cultivating lightness versus mandated happiness) with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by the third paragraph. One meaningful deepening through the private lesson with muted microphones suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, post-ban gathering) arrive early. The piece accumulates symbolic density through recurring motifs (humming colonnade, lantern-moth hush, dissolving boundaries) and builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the group steps onto the ice, reweighting permission and fear. However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page—no concrete forfeiture or consequence is visible in the final image. The RR reads as thematic assertion (boundaries dissolve "responsibly") without dramatized price, weakening closure under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—plant-based communication, poetic compression, lyric repetition of "after the phoenix rises"—and accumulates meaning through layered images. Orientation anchors (glassblower's courtyard, Ivo, post-phoenix setting) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ivo moves from searching to being found by the imperfect song, a stance crystallization with felt cost (he surrenders the hunt and accepts dwelling in brokenness). The cost is conceptual and embodied in the final plant arrangement and the line "he is no longer searching because the imperfect song finds him." One meaningful deepening occurs when the reed doesn't give him color names but teaches him rhythm, reweighting his stake. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (laboratory, post-outage, bell ringer narrator) within the opening beats and teaches an accumulative/textural lens through the pilgrimage's stations. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the city "tuning itself to hope," but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than legible as a foreclosed path or felt price. The lack of a clear before/after in the narrator's options or knowledge weakens the closure effect under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (observatory, tin of beads, "after Devin died"). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated origami placements, visitor scenes, and the lily projection deepening across uses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist settles into an open-ended vigil ("to wait") with visible cost (rock bottom acknowledged, ongoing solitude). One visible cost: the protagonist remains alone, tending an observatory that may never fill. The structure uses a two-phase shard (past grief → present ritual) within one contiguous window, legible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered client visits, each reweighting the cartomancer's methodology until the final "chorus that will let her sing alone" reprices solitary practice as communal echo. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost implied through the woman's isolation transformed into sustainable solo performance. One pressure tightening (cryptocurrency crash → barter economy) narrows client resources and forces methodological adaptation, satisfying the length's escalation requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established by ~80 words (archive, historian credentials, forbidden knowledge). The piece accumulates density through vertical ascent and intensifying imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator emerges "calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths" and teaches students to "avoid patterns." Cost is conceptual—no publication, a shift from citation-seeking to alignment—but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the narrator simply carries questions and teaches. The closure reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive tightening or charged poise moment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mira sacrifices her unlived life to restore Ilen's shadow, foreclosing her own "roads she never walked," and the library accepts the bargain by inking her name into the sky—cost is visible and felt. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vines tighten and Mira trades her dreams; the cadence shift and charged final image reweight the dominant stake. A micro causal slip: the river stone "anchors" the shadow, but the mechanics of how memory acquires mass remain gestural rather than earned by prior rule-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors POV, workshop, and post-con timeframe by line 5. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the handler commits to plain testimony over grand redemption, places relics side-by-side, and accepts scrutiny—"you will decide how much to believe"—foreclosing performative rescue with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tail removal parallels shedding ornament. Deduction: the con backstory is summarized in four lines mid-story, flattening causal linkage; the broker vanishes off-page, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands on-page with felt cost: planting the ivy in the fossil ring and releasing the hourglass sand is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting toward healing) that forecloses the wound-opening pattern. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through repeated images (ivy, coffee rings, hourglass, meteor hush) that reweight at closure. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (quiet tower at dawn, post-anesthesia wake). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist descends into the tunnel and reads the fossil ring, narrowing from seeking closure to offering it.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful pattern-teaching through recurring warehouse imagery and the film/letter interweaving. Orientation is clean: who (crystal gazer), where (projection booth), and when (storm night) anchor by the second paragraph. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final image of her writing a new goodbye that says "stay" crystallizes the warehouse metaphor and reconfigures "unused love" from stored-away to threshold-waiting with felt emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers her own name on the shelves, shifting from professional distance to personal stakes. The cost is conceptually clear (abandoning expertise-as-armor) though the tactical consequence of "stay" remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated archway circuits, meteor tracings, and the sculptor's release. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when clarify only after ~150 words of abstract aurora description. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculptor carves again, windows open) with felt cost (the instrument calls the narrator back), but the final paragraph drifts into thematic summary ("the night itself learns to speak") rather than holding a charged image. One meaningful deepening is present but weakened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the guard's charm gradually coaxes the archive from "occasionally everywhere" to "almost," culminating in spore deployment that transforms the train into a "greenhouse moving north." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the guard accepts dreamless duty as the cost of cultivating sparks, visible in "I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere, exactly where sparks are needed." Orientation anchors by line 3 (freight guard, rail, glowing dune). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the ending image reweights the opening's desolation with patient labor.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late causal micro-turn. Orientation anchors (philosopher, mechanical rainforest, post-sixth-sense-awakening) arrive early. The piece accumulates density through sensory particulars and wind-listening method until the gear-placement beat triggers a decisive shift: the hum resolves, the map appears, the shelter is revealed. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist gains a map and accepts the translocation cycle with visible cost ("I knew I would translocate during sleep again, delivered to tomorrow like a note"). One meaningful tightening occurs when pressing the gear home unravels the snag and opens the corridor. Cost is legible: the protagonist surrenders the comfort of ruin-as-teacher and accepts ongoing displacement as education.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through layered images (leash, star, skiff, ridgeway) that progressively reweight the vigil from ache to agency. The closure—reaching for the shimmer that "takes my hand"—crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's refusal ends and courage is claimed. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (bay, twilight, broken leash). Cost is felt ("I did not live," "I never opened") and the final act forecloses passivity, though the price remains oblique rather than viscerally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure building through recurring motifs (radiator clicks, cobalt windows, the bolt) until the final image crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration: silence remains but no longer demands forgiveness, and the protagonist's small action (touching the window, leaving a faint print) reweights the fortress's rule. Orientation anchors who (injured guest), where (cobalt fortress), and when (winter, nerve regeneration) by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the protagonist endures winter, accepts cold hope, and through "stubborn listening" shifts the terms of safety without breaking the silence. One meaningful deepening occurs (week seven, radiators translate, the humming choir returns) and the cost is legible: patience, sensation, and the acceptance that hope can be cold.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (library breathing, dust motes as stars, the rune of drift) and sustains it through layered imagery. Orientation anchors—who (Lyr, Serane), where (temple library), when (across shifting constellations)—arrive by ~15% but remain atmospheric rather than concrete, generating mild disorientation that resolves by midpoint without penalty since the pattern serves the lyric design. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Serane withdraws her claim, Lyr seals the scrap in a glossary, and the library's recursive calm returns—Earned Stasis with visible social cost (the prevented coronation, her public undoing). The rune of drift functions as both mechanism and thematic anchor, aligning past and present to force truth, which tightens options and charges the ending image of the ink pellet "like potential thunder."

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the corridor's breathing pattern is discovered, marked with lanterns, and affirmed to return predictably—the narrator and station share "one pulse, drifting moored." Cost is legible in the atlas page that "had to live alone" and the acceptance that assembled structures must move to survive. The accumulative lens holds cleanly from beat to beat, with the tapping rhythm serving as the through-line that stitches discovery to action. Orientation is anchored early (monitoring station, new keeper, post-ban world) and the causal chain from bleaching → wave-shift → corridor emergence is motivated and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's decision to broadcast the Lark's route reconfigures the rebellion from rage to orientation, with visible cost (exposure, "waking whoever had silenced them"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (stones-stars, hum-breath, opera glasses as chronology), culminating in the projector banner that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors early (spaceport, barefoot stargazer, father's disappearance). One meaningful tightening occurs when she closes the circuit with her palms, and the bay answers with the star map. Cost is legible: she steps into hangar light "barefoot and sure," carrying the risk forward.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Lida's discovery of the kite → decoding → unsealing the embryo → the seedling's growth forms a clear because/therefore chain, while the plant-whisper motif accumulates density and charges the final image. Orientation anchors (Lida, hot springs, reconstruction era) land by the second paragraph. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—crystallizes the choice between preserved destiny and steered tradition; the seedling's scaffold and children's laughter reweight prior pressure. Cost is visible (council opposition, solitary defiance) but felt cost at the moment of unsealing could be more acute; the amber "softened like honey" reads smooth rather than wrenching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council refuses and Lida acts alone, narrowing options with social and philosophical price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The story accumulates pressure through repeated encounters with triggers (vent fans, helicopter, photograph unfolding) and converges on the final image: "folded the photograph once more, the paper new only in the way his hands now held it, steady as a trellis in wind." Cost is visible—he can now hold the wound steadily rather than avoid it, foreclosing the path of pure avoidance. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (arboretum, cliff, Rafi). The mid-story gull rescue provides one meaningful tightening where freeze becomes functional action, and the logbook exhibit deepens stakes by externalizing his internal project. The photograph's final handling charges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, library, lighthouse) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The closure—Mara lighting the wick and writing in the ledger—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis): she commits to keep the light with visible cost (foregoing flight, accepting the keeper's mantle). The textural deepening through thread-lattice, card-threading, and wick-braiding tightens options and reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible on the page: "I will keep the light tonight, and I will keep the faces that come to it."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the protagonist refuses the metronome's throne and exits, causing it to "forget how to count"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (refusal that forecloses a path). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ephemeral ink patterns cohere into spatial architecture, the hummingbird's song makes invisible maps bloom, and the final act of lying in the ink and disappearing reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual and visible: the protagonist becomes outline-less, the market ends. One meaningful deepening occurs when the footfall maps reveal "a second set that walks perfectly between them"—the algorithm's hunger—which narrows the question from "who profits" to confronting the non-human buyer.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the letter is released through dormant networks, transforming the city's "dizzying quiet" into "tiny decisions" and "walking changed," with visible cost ("I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—density increases via braided images (frost, letters, conduits, breath) that converge at the midnight release. Orientation anchors (library, snow, archivist role) arrive early. One minor slip: the transition from reading the letter's historical content to deciding to release it compresses motivation slightly, though the "ritual from hesitation" passage bridges adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator ties the father's letter to the sandbag scrap, tells the rose the values again, and commits to tending "the breathing knives" until the city learns—a crystallized stance that forecloses reunion with visible cost ("He will return when the city learns...Until then"). The pattern of visitors → ritual → conversion accumulates density and the final vow reweights all prior particulars. Cost is legible in the father's exile and the narrator's solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (fisher) and what (sound-wave sea, goddess echo) by the second paragraph, meeting the ~120-word test. The piece accumulates density through braided imagery—rail spike as tuning fork, constellations as sleepwalkers—and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fisher returns the map to the tide rather than hoarding it, a renunciation that forecloses ownership with on-page cost ("let the map spill back"). However, the mechanics of "voicing silence" and how the spike "transliterates emotions" remain impressionistic; the reader infers rather than witnesses cause-and-effect. One meaningful deepening occurs when the constellations examine the spike and the garden shudders, reweighting the goddess's presence from echo to active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: the journalist's cut line → climb → wager → lens closing → world stalling → board call forms a because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she commits the family apparatus to open data and reorients power ("gravity is a fine servant and a poor god"), foreclosing the old complicity. Orientation anchors by line 2 (spiral observatory, heiress, father's pen nib). The wager functions as a clean reversal that narrows options and the ending call reweights all prior material with social cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator moves through a night of translation work, layering encounters with letters, recorder, amber, client, and finally self-inscription until the final image reweights the guilt motif. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning toward tentative action): the protagonist tattoos himself, accepts the amber, and commits to staying "until the dissonance finally unmade itself"—a renunciation of flight with visible cost ("I am not forgiven, not yet"). Orientation anchors are present early (tattooist, lab, letters) and causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each object and encounter adds density until the final beat. One minor cost-legibility issue: the exact nature of what the protagonist forfeits by staying could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mandala ritual gathers voices, the tile flake shifts listening, and the final image ("emergent hush rode home in breathing") reweights the opening mist and chalk with felt cost—the assignment outlasting ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the child's dictum crystallizes the unlearning's rule without decisive action, and the cost is conceptual (ongoing mess, no tidy resolution). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bearded man's confession shifts the mandala's "groove of speaking." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who: steel-armed narrator; where: ancient plaza; when: after fire) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the renaming ritual deepens from boy to perpetrators, and the tessera returns with reweighted meaning in the final line. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the past "loosens" after the men are rebound to labor), but the cost remains atmospheric—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page makes the "loosening" legible as a before/after with price paid. The dominant stake (mending through renaming) coheres, and one meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator moves from helping the boy to confronting the arsonists.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory ritual and recurring motifs (coin, echoes, orchard) that deepen toward the final shared bow. Orientation anchors quickly: locked theater, orchard, amphitheater. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the ghost rehearsing "a last bow for tomorrow, promising to return only if we can finish letting go together" crystallizes the iterative, mutual release with felt emotional cost—nostalgia must end to free both. The cost is legible in "learning our rhythm" and "letting go," though the mechanics of what changes tomorrow remain implicit. One meaningful deepening (from nightly repetition to intentional closure rehearsal) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the pair completes the ritual, leaves the sliver "gladly set aside," and embodies a method of return "not by force but by kindness." The cost is legible—relief rather than erasure, acceptance rather than reversal—and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern layering toward a cadence shift). Orientation anchors early (studio, after shock, two figures) and the lens holds through the ending. Subtracting minor non-closure points: the middle beats loop certain images without adding decisive pressure, and the phrase "devised a way to return" in the final paragraph leans toward summary rather than a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—sensory mapping, negotiation through objects, layered memories—and accumulates pressure through the storm surge and the protagonist's repeated micro-negotiations with the cave. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the contract holds," "partnered, and my voice learns restraint." The fossil's relocation and the protagonist's logged promise constitute a visible cost (relinquishing ownership, accepting partnership terms). Orientation anchors are present by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the fossil's permanent placement, reweighting the relationship from carried token to resident contract.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (warehouse, hourglass turner, canyon echo jar) arrive early. The piece accumulates density through the button-cataloging sequence and culminates in the warehouse opening and villagers arriving, which reconfigures the prophecy from "lock" to "loom" and the protagonist's role from enforcer to offerer. Cost is conceptual and social (confession without punishment, shared carrying) but remains oblique—no single on-page sentence makes the forfeited path or price undeniable. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but lacks the sharp cost proof required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal threads. Orientation anchors early (burned spy, zephyr bluff, mist, spring's tilt). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Ansel retires the microfilm to the sea, keeps the ring, and accepts Len's offer of quieter work—a visible renunciation that forecloses spectacle and reweights "courage" from fireworks to endurance. Cost is on the page: he lets go of secrets and former identity for safehouses and mending work. The lens holds; textural density (silver hush, pressure metaphors) accumulates and the final image (ring over scars, walking home renewed) reconfigures the opening exile.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (fog-bound crossing, coachman beside trap, Wren approaching) land within 120 words, meeting the test. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (palimpsest, yarn needle, map-stitching) and the final line—"the day moved forward with them"—offers Charged Poise where the map-sail trembles with earned serenity and the road "looks less like burdens and more like breathing." Cost is felt in the ambient transition from gloom to breath, supported by "not erasing, but warming the scars." One meaningful deepening (the stitching ritual that braids fear into motion) suffices at this length, though the turn is gradual rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece braids observation, ritual action, and timeline shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise). Orientation anchors quickly (wasteland, oasis, hives). The lantern glass enables escalation by revealing three threads, and the potter's actions (water, cleaning, song, cups) accumulate pressure that crystallizes in "the place resisted change by practicing it gently"—a conceptual repricing with felt cost (she leaves the cups and walks away). One causal seam: the thrumming "climbed the note" feels slightly unmotivated, emerging more from lyric will than scene logic, but the closure lands with cost intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (petals, harbor, flame) and a cadence shift at the lighthouse that reweights the protagonist's grief into active care. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the beam sweeping the harbor and the child's pointing prayer crystallize the protagonist's commitment to "instill in the bricks a habit of kindness." Orientation anchors (fire escape, harbor, lighthouse) appear early and remain stable. The cost—accepting the mother's decline and choosing to act despite delay—is legible in the match-strike and beam-sweep, though it could be sharpened with a more explicit forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (librarian-narrator), where (tidal library above clouds), and the stake (maintaining independence through resonance with extinct voices) within the first third. The crisis—stone circle faltering, shelves dropping—provides a meaningful pressure point, and the narrator's sung herd call stabilizes the system, constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the narrator maintains independence by active tuning rather than passive waiting). Cost is felt in the effort and the acceptance of ongoing solitude with purpose. The piece coheres under its lens, though the escalation is a single deepening rather than a cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered image and recursive phrasing until the lovers rejoin at the bowl, fulfilling the installation's design. Orientation anchors (lotus temple, after rain, ghostwriter narrator) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—lovers stepping closer and holding "a shared sentence"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the social/emotional cost is felt in the crowd's hush and the exposure of private letters. One slight slip: the lovers' convergence feels choreographed by the narrator's setup rather than driven by their own agency, which softens causal pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening lines (midnight shift, university radio station, election season). The narrative follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: the protagonist detects the signal, traces it to the booster, diagnoses manipulation, then counteracts it through subsonic counter-tuning—each beat tightens options and raises stakes. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the protagonist refuses the committee chair, accepts messiness over control, and labels a channel for emergencies. The final annotation "to outwit cosmic tricksters, teach people their breath" reconfigures the premise with felt weight. One hairline gap: the wave's "receding" after the protagonist's refusal could have shown more on-page friction or consequence to fully land the cost of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, metaphor-dense narration, spatial poetics—and the closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist sets the key, the door sighs open, and the telescope reveals the mutiny as "a hunger to be heard," reweighting the spatial conflict without requiring a decisive external change. Orientation anchors (who, shadowed nexus, fallow period) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the organ's reverberation "transfixes" the triangle and the alleys "sit straighter," tightening spatial agency. Cost is conceptual and felt: the protagonist defies the Council and commits to "wistful rebellion," and the final image of the aligned cobbles registers as a truce whose price is the protagonist's ongoing defiance. The accumulation of metaphor and the reliance on implied spatial rules create minor friction, but the closure effect is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates evidence fragments—ribbon, phone case, vial—building a pattern that reweights Mara's disappearance from vanishing victim to willing sacrifice. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the painting and subsequent letter reframe the night as "fear met gentleness...and both stepped back." Orientation anchors early (quarry, mist, narrator's condition). One meaningful deepening occurs when the blue ribbon contradicts the file's red fox mask, forcing a tactical shift in the narrator's theory. Cost is conceptual and felt in the final image of forgiveness, though the letter mechanism distances the reader from witnessing the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—inserting the nail to reverse exile and return the exiled—lands on the page with causal setup (coded stanzas lead to the panel, ancestor designed the system). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (weather station, jet stream shift, reversible exile program). The dominant lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture; the nail insertion is a motivated turn that changes the station's state. However, cost at closure is primarily external (director's anger, returned exiles) rather than a visible personal forfeit or foreclosed path for the narrator, and the director's "raved about safety" confrontation deflates quickly without sustained friction or lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (glass, scaffold, bridge) gather weight and converge at closure when the fiddler plays "the measure that forgives" and the hitchhiker resolves into presence. Orientation anchors (pullout, post-vanishing) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image reconfigures loss into conditional return—with conceptual cost legible in "the ledger closes, if only until another crossing." One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass shard clarifies and the system "signs a receipt," tightening possibility. Causality within the lyric mode is elliptical but purposeful, taught by scaffold metaphors and paid off at the river meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the startup arc and culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the tiger-car rut and the final realization reweight the central question with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors appear by the third sentence (abandoned circus train, twilight, salt flats). The escalation reads as cadence shift and pattern accumulation rather than causal narrowing, appropriate to the lens. Cost is visible in the shutdown and the narrator's lingering, though the final insight could benefit from sharper on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds density through recurring star-reading, the telegram opens at midpoint, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "through shared burdens we learned meaning" crystallizes the practice with conceptual cost (the temple as listening witness). Orientation is clean by line 4. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara speaks back and the inscriptions yield unexpected chambers, reweighting the decoding stake. Conceptual cost is legible in the final image of "healing travels fastest by ordinary words."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—expanding circles, layered imagery—and builds density through the descent into the lake's well of lost things. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mayor breathes the truth, the orchard unspools, and the protagonist pockets a coin as "receipt for deliverance." Cost is visible in the mayor's trembling and the crowd's shift from spectators to witnesses. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed eats the lie and the truth stands "like a soldier at ease."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure) and teaches its pattern early: lyric compression, future-arrived-early time logic, and scar-linking as the method of navigation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise): the new vow "recorded in cambium" and the mirrored crossroads reconfigure the covenant with conceptual cost (the gardeners lower their shears, time becomes conditional "sometimes"). The orientation is adequate by ~120 words (narrator grafted to mapletree, cobalt glade at dusk, post-eclipse), though "after the future arrives early" remains abstract until the woman's arrival clarifies it. Escalation proceeds through the scar-linking, maze-walking, and final confrontation with the gardeners, but the causal pressure is softer than the texture; many beats accumulate atmosphere rather than narrowing options with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist plants what she will never keep, accepts her ongoing role as tender of listening seeds, with visible cost (scattering grandmother's stories into roots). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (bone-hand, ash map, listening seeds) that reweight the "patch holes in the soul" stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's destiny is bartered and the protagonist's seam closes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates through layered reflection anchored to present objects (locker contents), building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist writes a recommendation that honors memory over market value, foreclosing pure professional distance with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (quarry office, narrator alone with Bowers, post-radio-failure timeframe) arrive within the first ~10% and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scrap "insisted on naming itself" and the narrator decides "facts could hold space without bricking it shut," shifting from emotional insulation to integration. Cost is legible in the final catalog entry and the phrase "sometimes you keep a rock not for hardness but for echo."

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the haunted ambitions quiet into "a patient corridor") with visible cost: the protagonist abandons ownership of transition and accepts a companionship role. The arbor-as-sentence metaphor coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure builds through voice-tuning and node adjustments to reestablish the serenade. Orientation is swift (magnetic arbor, clay tablets, suspended trunks). One tightening—reestablishing harmonic guidance before trunks spark—drives the arc without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, accretive pattern by the first third (tidal imagery, salt-bright drawers, migrating identities) and sustains it through a single continuous encounter that culminates in the woman's name settling and her coat transforming into chlorophyll. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woman pins the card to her sleeve, the bells cool to a hush, and the librarian returns to the clerkship of tides, reweighting the ritual with felt finality. Orientation anchors (tidal atrium, titan-gear librarian, wintersun, "after tomorrow disappears") are signaled early and remain stable. The cost is oblique but legible: the woman leaves, the atrium slickens, the bells fall silent—options are reconfigured, not decisively altered. One meaningful tightening occurs when the three library cards resolve into "one true name," narrowing identity flux and charging the final image with ritual acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in an accumulative/textural mode: pressure builds through layered confessions and images rather than causal linkage. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing when the pearl's placement "rewrites" the bunker door and the narrator logs it as "habitable for communion"—a shift in meaning with felt cost (career stance renounced). However, the cost reads oblique; the narrator's professional consequences or internal foreclosure are asserted more than shown. The orientation anchors (cave, inspector badge, bunker door) arrive early and remain legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell's directive crystallizes the choice, but the mechanics of how placing the pearl physically alters bunkers "above" remain ungrounded, weakening causal credibility even under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator steps into the shallow, counts to twelve, and rewrites the field-book entry ("the river was itself, and I would stop asking it to be me"), forecloses self-punishment with visible cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through graffiti coordinates, accordion wheeze, sluice gate, and culvert, culminating in a cadence shift at the shallow. Orientation anchors quickly (station, ivy, accordion). One minor ambiguity: the graffiti's mechanics ("drunk surveyor") feel slightly pat, but the closure image lands with undeniable pressure and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but remain vague: "veiled dreamer" is a metaphor, not a name; the library's location and the timeline between letters are never made concrete. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (mist, cipher, watch, breath), but no meaningful tightening or pattern break occurs—the watch opens, the library admits entry, the letter is written without resistance or escalation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("Between two fateful letters I had become a messenger"), yet no on-page cost is legible: the protagonist gains access and completes the task without forfeiting, enduring, or crystallizing a charged choice. The Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows what was paid or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Ilya, provenance researcher), where (velvet observatory), and when (midsummer, noon deadline) within the first few lines. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through layered imagery (coffee stains, ferns, ice violin), then a cadence shift at "He set the bow" tightens into the playing beat, and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the violin dissolves and "the promise already fulfilled" reweights the opening stakes with undeniable cost (the artifact is destroyed, the museum finds only "damp strings"). One meaningful deepening—Ilya's internal weighing of dream versus empire—sufficiently escalates under the accumulative mode, though a second micro-turn (coffee reading, fern memory) adds texture without muddying the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (beautician mortician), where (skyborne grotto), and when (tonight, post-death) by the opening paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, the chip's activation sequence, and pattern-finding in static rather than causal reversal. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the balm infusion captures "one last spark," the vision of shared memory reweights their relationship, and the grotto returns through cloud). Visible cost is present but muted—the mentor is already gone, so the final act preserves rather than forecloses. The lens holds, but the deepening feels more like ritual completion than a tightening that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece builds pressure through imagery, ritual action, and pattern (forgiveness → ascent → tending → release). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (post-forgiveness, grotto climb). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist shifts from seeking contentment to becoming its caretaker, with the hairpin absorbed into the wall as visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wall opens and the vines respond to pruning, reweighting the quest from capture to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: narrator and Lark, where: lighthouse gallery, when: dawn after camping) land within the first third. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—images and ceremonial objects (cloak, mirror shard, chimes) accrue pressure toward a final stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Lark crystallizes her decision to return money and name officials, with the shard serving as a charged final image that reweights her performance/authenticity tension. The closure moment lands with conceptual cost (political vulnerability, promised tax cuts reversed), though the emotional price remains slightly distant. One meaningful deepening occurs when the third chime pattern introduces "speak and set terms," reframing the binary.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. The piece moves from platform setup through stone-throwing ritual to trance vision to waking reconfiguration, teaching a pattern of delayed revelation that pays off when "I vanished where I hindered, and appeared where space needed." Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "vanishing to appear" from paradox to gift of space with the cost of persistent letting-go. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs in the trance when the narrator sees "my persistence had become a dam" and agrees to release, altering the stance from seeker to space-maker.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory anchors (bone towers, black mirror, bird patterns) and a cadence shift at closure when the protagonist casts the arrowhead and achieves navigational address without moving. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world redrawn inside the protagonist, distances folding, and the pulse less alone—cost is felt as the empty cord and stones left behind. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (canyon, ledge, protagonist role by ~10% mark), and the accumulation tightens once through the arrowhead's introduction and its final use. Minor weakness: the "wandering pulse" remains abstract and its exact constraint on tactics is oblique, reducing causal precision within the accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the climb-and-descent frame is legible. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory density and recursive imagery (light as patient teacher, keystone as question, hush on hands) until the street practice reweights the dominant stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist climbs once more to unstrap the keystone, refusing ownership—a renunciation that forecloses commodification with visible cost (the ongoing climb, the street table work). The felt cost is clear in "apprentice forever" and the sky closing "with a satisfied, flickering smile." One minor loop near the middle recounts the light's nature twice without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the lamplighter leaves a vow to "light the pier without tiring of attention," binding herself to patient labor with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds: descent→library discovery→hum-color realization→vow→surfacing forms a coherent tightening. Orientation anchors (pier, harbor, fog-thinned night, sky lantern release) land early. One meaningful deepening (the hum acquires "thawing silver" and the vow binds) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dome dilates, the corridor of silence opens, and the pair face "the hush, understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose." Cost is felt—they've enacted a backwards prophecy that compels them to trust blind chance—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural: pattern, prophecy-reversal, density increase) holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late but are legible by mid-story. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy's middle clause is fulfilled, compelling the distillation; causality runs "uphill" as taught, and the final image reweights the opening vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The observatory ritual accumulates pressure through listening, naming glass fears, and the climactic encounter with Miren's voice, which crystallizes into "Shoreless" and then eases into the rafters—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts the recurring work with no triumph, foreclosing the path of final closure). Orientation anchors (heartbroken reaper, ancient observatory, dusk, after finding recordings) land cleanly in the opening lines. Cost is visible: "he would bow to that" when fears flee unnamed, and the new corridor of work opens without resolution. One meaningful deepening occurs when her voice arrives and he names the wound.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through sensory pattern (drips, gulls, bell hum) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration—Efan rebuilds "an echo, not the original," the sea returns "a silver ripple...modest as a memory." Cost is legible: he knows the repair is partial, the city does not cheer, and the ending image carries visible constraint ("modest," "decides to stay"). Orientation anchors (viaduct, dawn, Efan, the bell, the declaration) land cleanly within the first sixth. One tightening point: Efan's thread-and-reed calibration narrows the drip ceremony and shifts the sea's breathing, fulfilling accumulative escalation. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the trail of photographs and converges at the ridge gathering where separate versions "braid into one careful rope of meaning." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the warden decides not to expunge, calls the group, and the town becomes "more than ruins" through shared telling—felt cost is legible in his defiance of bureau orders and the undeniable social reconfiguration on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. One weakness: the causal link between finding the photographs and the decision to gather people feels slightly telescoped; the turn at "he understands that the bureau wants the town to die a second, cleaner death" is declared more than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Iri seals the reliquary "with a whisper and a steady breath" and walks out "carrying nothing but balance," crystallizing her dual commitment to logic and intuition. Cost is present but muted—she forfeits the formulas and leaves the crystal behind—yet the final image lacks a visible consequence that would make the price undeniable on the page. The ending reweights prior material but the felt cost remains oblique, preventing entry to the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "The weight on my ribs loosens, not fully gone, but carried better, a harness adjusted rather than a dismissal." Cost is felt—the mutual debt remains, poise earned through revised approach and shared code. Orientation anchors quickly (arbor platforms, cloud seam, watcher role). The escalation moves from static check to cloud vortex warning to the ship's shudder and safe docking, reweighting the watcher's self-trust and the pilot's returned reliance. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the final image charges prior material (parachute buckle, tapping, the scar).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (floating dojo, clouds, bells, the humming jar) and uses recurring phrases ("while history rewrites itself," "slices through pretense") to build toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator announces joint custody and feels "the frost inside me drain." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. The closure moment—joint custody as the answer to complementary opposites—carries conceptual cost (neither claimant wins alone, the pattern requires both) but the felt price remains abstract; the narrator's internal shift is declared ("gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible trade-off on the page, limiting the weight of the RR.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via layered metaphors and the tunnel functions as amplifier and judge. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the house "sighs awake," laughter arrives "foundational," and grief "tips his wet hat"—a crystallized final image where options reconfigure. Cost is implied but oblique; the text asserts that "the conductor lowers his arms in thanks" and carries home "the repaired silence," yet no visible forfeiture or irreversible choice is dramatized on the page. Orientation is present early (tunnel, conductor, household three blocks away) but the "household" remains off-stage throughout, making the stakes feel reported rather than witnessed. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother hears the squeal and the conductor catches it, tightening the ritual's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric-episodic pattern early (frozen garden, unwritten books, off-season stars) and sustains pressure through density increase and motif recurrence. Orientation anchors (frozen garden, mist, sundial, guardian) arrive by line 3; the "through the veil of sleep" frame is clear. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the protagonist interiorizes thresholds and carries them, reweighting the opening homesickness with companionable ache and reciprocal friendship with uncertainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant's bead "keeps a sliver of my breath," raising the cost of belonging elsewhere. The lens holds without contradiction, and cost is legible in the final image of thinned day and uncertainty as companion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the gate opens, the narrator steps through with embers at their ankles, and the crozier hisses to ash behind them—a decisive foreclosure of the old path with felt cost (burning the relic, accepting cold, stepping into unknown air). The Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held: density increases through iterative adjustments, the crozier's transformation accrues meaning, and the final cadence shift ("I walked with the care of someone who has begun to live") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored early (ember nexus, twilight, furnaces, satchel contents) and the single continuous scene maintains causal coherence under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational accents—pressure builds through density, pattern, and the city's breathing cycle until the mast becomes stylus and the gorge a record. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): the protagonist places the hush and star fragment, descends with the empty box, and the city "learned to keep time with what it let go"—a reweighting with conceptual and emotional cost legible in the act of leaving the tools behind. One minor slip: the grandmother's appearance and the engineer's note feel like late additions that complicate rather than tighten, but they do not break the lens or the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece establishes a coherent pattern (vanishing ferry, fluid reality, recurring motifs) taught early and held through closure. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (deckhand, ferry, dawn departures). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ferry steadies, the pier becomes permanent, arrivals no longer vanish—with felt cost in the line "breath steadies after grief learns its rhythm." The cost is present but relies on metaphor; a more concrete forfeiture or visible price would strengthen the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words. The piece teaches a pattern of charged lines and room transformations that accumulate pressure; the ending reconfigures the architect's project from artifact-building to habit-installation with modest conceptual cost ("leave no artifacts, only habits"). The curator's acceptance and the visitor's participation form a triangle that holds—a Charged Poise moment—but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or foreclosed option. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though the final image could have sharpened the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien-contact era) and the piece teaches its accumulative/lyric pattern early: the instructor explains edge geometry through teaching, night mapping, and finally communion with the returning aliens. The closure—"I knew then how to teach them all"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the instructor's stance crystallizes from wanting to learn starlight navigation into understanding how edges hold that knowledge) with felt cost visible in the years of tracing, the voluntary night crawls, and the humility of the bow. The link from teaching exercises to answering with edge geometry to receiving unfolded horizons creates a causal thread within the accumulative frame, and the final teaching dictum reweights all prior edge-tracing with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—pulses, fog, the photograph, and the hearing aid build density and converge at closure when the narrator guides child and man to connect. Orientation anchors (atrium, twilight, the dead call) land early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator facilitates connection without forcing resolution, and the final line acknowledges both agency and its limits ("incidental heroism, nothing I intended"). Cost is conceptual—patience, the will to keep listening—but remains legible in the reeling hush that frames the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist powers down the terminal, leaves the fleck, and exits—foreclosing her claim and honoring the unremembered with felt cost (she "laughed, and it sounded wrong"). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture: each beat (cave entry, door unsealing via fleck, terminal wake, reading names, finding her own note, leaving fleck) tightens options and the ending image reweights the theft. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (cave mouth, tidal window, narrator identity). One micro turn (discovering her own name) sets up the final renunciation without fragmenting the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: the protagonist returns, confronts the ghost-echo, recalibrates the array, and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—placing the shard back "not as a wound, but as a lens cut small for carrying." Orientation anchors (opal observatory, snow, radio static, lone protagonist) land by the third paragraph. The closure reweights the opening's "stubborn metronome" counting into "courage to continue anyway" with felt cost: the mistake is not erased but integrated. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost shifts from the protagonist's voice to the mentor's, altering the protagonist's understanding of culpability.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through density of texture-translation attempts, deepening via listener-kites and bird choreography, and the closure—a school where texture learned to sing—reconfigures the canyon from archive to living pedagogue with conceptual cost (the narrator's travel-name and permanent residence). Orientation anchors arrive within the first two paragraphs (dusk, canyon, towers of bone, echo-tunnel). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist shifts from solo translation to building distributed listeners and harnessing bird-flight, which widens the tunnel's capacity and enables the treaty recitation. The cost is legible: the name sacrifice and the permanent caretaker role. Minor causality softness: the birds "teaching" the kites and "pleased" echoes anthropomorphize without clear mechanics, and the leap from texture-as-grain to "choir" and "school" compresses multiple steps into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern layering (garden breathing, missing returns, the arrowhead's transformations) that converge at the descent and metamorphosis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the protagonist accepts keeper status, the garden "metamorphose[s] our bitterness," and "morning had been taught to return without changing what it loved"—a visible reweighting with conceptual cost (remaining "kept"). Orientation anchors who/where/mission by the third paragraph. One persistent concern: the causal link between planting the arrowhead and the staircase opening reads more associative than because/therefore, which fits the Accumulative lens but leaves the protagonist's agency feeling passive at the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard and statues shift from enforcement to participation) with felt cost visible in the violinist's sustained risk and the crowd's gathering attention. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory layering (sap, scent, moss), the locust shell recurs with reweighted meaning, and the final cadence shift ("beauty does not beg...it teaches stone to dream") reweights the premise. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (sky-bridge, orchard, statues). One meaningful deepening occurs when the statue's hand pauses and moss bubbles. Minor causality stretch: the statues' receptivity to heart-rhythm feels asserted more than earned through prior rule-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (mailman, disputed territory, sunrise checkpoint) land within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final delivery and walk through the cobalt arcade crystallize the stance with felt cost in "heart ungoverned" and the boy's postural change. Cost is present but oblique—the emotional and social price is implied through atmosphere rather than a sharp on-page forfeit. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mina's mirror reveals the boy, reweighting the route from abstract rebellion to specific care.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational pressure layer. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (wind bells, misting hush, carousel imagery recur and deepen). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the final paragraph reweights the train's "sleep" into active presence ("wore the day") and the carpenter's vow is kept on the page through shared work and synchronized bells. Cost is legible in the shift from solitary repair to communal tending and the surrendering of silence for song. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wrong-turn oasis reveals the train's thirst for voice, altering the carpenter's tactics from mechanical to resonant repair. The causal chain (discovery → singing → halo fragment activation → carousel turning → travelers engaging) holds under accumulative logic. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (who, where, when). No causality breaks; transitions are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominant: the piece teaches its pattern by ~25% (shelving by curvature, scarf ritual, hyperbolic geometry references) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the librarian returns "the way a river returns, by leaving evidence of curves," filing the card and embodying the search rather than completing it, with cost legible in "not found...but seen its weather." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening stanza. One meaningful deepening occurs when the saddle-space becomes navigable and the reading room with no walls materializes, tightening the dominant stake (finding where stories live) into a weathered reconnaissance rather than arrival. Cost is conceptual and opportunity: the search continues, closure deferred, but the method is validated and the library "counts back in waves."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (palette, plates, cipher) toward a final reconfiguration where the dream is "named without chains" and the library "opened its throat." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist refuses to turn around, sustaining luminous absence as principle, and the cost is felt in renunciation ("Some absences must remain luminous"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sea "asked what price I set on waking" and the protagonist answers, narrowing the pursuit's nature. The lens holds and closure lands with conceptual cost; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through mirrored courtyard imagery, ribbon handling, and singing beats that deepen the stake (voice as wound → voice as beginning). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist sings despite fear, the ribbon releases, and the idea of return is freed with felt cost ("cold that had held my tongue"). Orientation anchors (locksmith arrives, courtyard reached) land by the first third. One tightening: the courtyard scene crystallizes the choice to sing, reweighting prior silence. Cost is conceptual and relational—"the sky hummed in answer" signals acceptance, and the locksmith's departure with the ribbon marks the forfeiture of the keepsake's binding function. No causality breaks, though the metaphorical density occasionally obscures whether events are literal or interior.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist recovers fragments, not everything, and writes the correction with visible cost ("not mine to keep, but enough to begin a repair"). The orchard-as-library metaphor ("charged late fees") makes the price undeniable. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (island, tide list, sunken greenhouse). One meaningful deepening occurs when the truth-confession brightens the ring and returns grandmother's cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council grants a "stay stamped with reluctant faith," the child hears themselves "returning, not suddenly brave, but mentored into resilience," and the final line reweights "keeping" versus "hoarding" with conceptual cost legible on the page. Causal lens holds: tea-leaf geometry → council unsettlement → reversal of decree. Orientation anchors (archivist, library, dusk) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council's measuring-tape audit confronts the shadow corridor and the pattern of reversible exile crystallizes into policy reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory layering and mythic compression early; the seed gathers testimonies across beats and culminates in a planting that reweights the valley's memory. Orientation anchors (Miren, parapet, waterfall) land within the first ~80 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the seed is planted "where the worlds already greet each other," and the valley promises to "remember to breathe"—a cadence shift with conceptual cost (the ongoing work of wonder-keeping). One persistent tightening: the child's loneliness is drawn into the seed, altering the valley's future. The cost is more implied than visceral, keeping the score from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains coherent pressure through density and cadence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the masks transition from restless to grounded, spirits from panic to choosing to stay) with felt cost legible in the line "each released a last sip of storm." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening—unraveling the net and freeing trapped breath—sufficiently tightens the dominant stake. Minor deduction: the escalation remains steady rather than introducing a sharp turn or foreclosing option.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered video evidence, procession detail, vault descent, and the final reframing decision. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator frames the tear visible, reopens the chapel conditionally ("and then see"), and returns to shop practice with added ritual. Cost is conceptual and occupational—"a wound is also a seam"—and the final note modulates professional stance with earned humility. One credible deepening (video comparison → seam discovery → village gathering) tightens options without mechanical reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: a mosaic of linked observations within the library wreck building density toward a conceptual repricing of "letting go" anchored in the final ascent. Orientation is clean (diver, sunken library, post-Earhart discovery) by the second paragraph. The closure—rising with the snow globe, promising to return it to light, noting time for "air and sorrow"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the narrator's mission from cataloging death to granting second chances. Cost is felt in the gauges, the tug, and the release of the ship "like a thought relinquished," though the visible price could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (misty courtyard above clouds, balladeer role, ghost in wires). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the balladeer becomes "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt, so the city could breathe," with visible cost in the shift from performer to translator and the ongoing obligation to "keep translating their bruised perfume." Escalation reads as density increase and pattern crystallization—chalk/paint messages accumulate into a functional map, valves blink, vents open, the courtyard pulses. One micro turn: the ghost "pressed through the drawing" and synced tempo. Cost is clear: agency redefined, louder songs abandoned, perpetual listening required. The piece fits Track A (single POV, one extended scene/window, coherent accumulative lens to closure).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ten-floor structure teaches its pattern early and each rise deepens understanding of Mirek's cipher and the narrator's parallel task. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the diary left open, letters arranged "warmly inquisitive") with conceptual cost legible in the line "joy, once found, keeps the bolts from tiring"—a reweighting of the servant's role. Orientation is clear (servant, elevator, spire) by the opening lines. One minor causality slip: the cipher wheel appears suddenly on floor seven without prior setup of negative-space technique.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the gondola's return and the blank lines in the log crystallize the proof that "empty spaces remember," reweighting the narrator's grief-driven taxonomy with visible conceptual cost (professional vulnerability via the unconventional log). The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (emotional cloud categorization) and held through the drift sequence; causality operates through sensory cues and atmospheric changes that guide navigation choices. The string-break inciting incident at the opening anchors the escalation cleanly. One micro-slip: the captain's laugh and acceptance arrive quickly, but the final image ("blank lines where the sky remembered") secures the closure effect with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mural holds as the building collapses, reweighting the protagonist's quest to "mirror the sky inside walls" with undeniable cost—the artist chose to stay and the room survived. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure built through layered beats (search, coin discovery, pigment mixing, limit-testing) that converge in the final image of the dawn glowing on bark. Orientation anchors (tree trunk library, condemned building, face-blind artist hired to paint sky) are clear by the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the foreman grants "one more minute," narrowing options and raising the cost of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (apprentice, Petrel airship, dusk). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory density, pattern correspondences (grid/hopscotch/birds/porthole), and a mounting hum until the figure-eight maneuver releases the luminance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the opening curiosity as a mission statement, and the cost is legible—the apprentice remains alone, lantern-lit, committed to watching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the apprentice deciphers the hopscotch and acts on it, narrowing tactical options and paying off prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece presents a continuous journey—locksmith enters frozen library, navigates to mirror hall, adjusts clocks, reaches reading room, leaves—with clear spatial progression. Orientation anchors (who, where, timeframe) arrive early enough. The accumulative lens holds: lyric density builds toward the final trade ("the library had repaired him as much as he had repaired it"), and the closure image reconfigures the opening motif of repair as reciprocal exchange. However, cost remains asserted rather than dramatized; no specific forfeiture or visible price shapes the final image, only the claim of mutual attention.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who (beyond collective "we"), where (orchard planet), and when (post-storm integration) emerge gradually but anchor by ~15% without fatal confusion. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through gift-giving, chalk messages, the arch crisis, then the launch toward the nebula. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the nebula corridor unveiling, bell rung as oath, mist as benediction), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no legible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The before/after hinges on collective motion, not a decisive turn with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (lighthouse, adjuster role, dusk setting). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: density builds through nested images and the final sung vow crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the closure cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page—no line shows what the protagonist forfeits or risks by singing, and the outcome (riots pause, soldier blinks) remains off-stage and reversible. Under the Cost proof test, I cannot point to an exact sentence where the protagonist's own options narrow or a price is paid, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 9 (caretaker, orchard, cliff). The piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it; the closure unit is Earned Stasis—the narrator returns to the rows after obeying the bargain, foreclosing escape with felt cost ("the orchard loosened its hold, just a little"). The cost is legible on the page in the final image of returning to trace absent streets and await the next pair of boots. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's nut unlocks the wall, reweighting the orchard's geometry and allowing passage.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors promptly (braided ravine, notebook, compass, polymer chemist identity). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered observation (alder shade chrysalis, foam patterns, swallows) until the climactic sketch of the Braiding copolymer with "reversible rings" that close "when calm returned." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vow to carry the chrysalis and the plan to change contracts reconfigures her stance from flight to repair, with visible cost signaled ("lawsuits and scorn"). Cost proof is legible in "I could not bear a lab's confession, nor the courtroom's, so I came to the river" versus "I returned to the city... a plan that would change the plant, the contracts, and the apologies." The ellipsis between sketch and implementation is purposeful compression that fits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece coheres around the dominant stake (gain entry to the vault) and escalates through density increase—each ritual step (moonlight proofreading, incising the map, quantifying absence) tightens the route. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vendor receives the comma-seed "so heavy with maybe" and returns to the counter before anyone knocks, reweighting the opening lull with charged potential. The cost is conceptual and felt—the seed will sprout only "during the lull on a store's very first opening day," locking the vendor into a singular, unrepeatable moment. Minor orientation lag in the first paragraph (shutters, shop, orchard library, sea of clouds arrive quickly but spatial anchors clarify only gradually) does not fully trigger the Orientation Test penalty because the lyric mode is taught early and the disorientation serves the otherworldly tone.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through recurring images (puddles, coral, ice, remorse) and a cadence shift at the cooking sequence that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the keeper endures with visible cost ("standing taller… without bleeding every time he moved"), and the chef saves coral for future use, forecloses the path of erasure. Orientation anchors (fortress, chef, post-rain) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pavilion filament touches the chef and transfers the keeper's memory, narrowing options from observation to transformative cooking. Cost is legible in the keeper's embodied relief and the chef's decision to keep a tool for future work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens—montage of bridge-building beats and multilingual refrains—but never tightens or deepens pressure toward a single closure moment. The ending recapitulates the premise ("Bridges hold because songs repeat") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, and the mosaic pattern is taught, but the closure image merely restates the status quo rather than reweighting it. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the final third demonstrates a visible or felt price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered memory-visions, the mirror's fractures multiply vantage points, and the final shattering reweights the protagonist's stance from salvage to cartographer of seams. Orientation anchors (moonlit canyon, solo engineer, broken mirror) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist shifts from viewing memories as recoverable objects to becoming "the patient recorder of abandoned dreams," accepting fragmentation as method. Cost is legible in the mirror's final split and the protagonist's surrender of trophy-seeking, though the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally painful. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (archivist, grotto, tilt-hour) by the first third and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the narrator moves deeper, tries crowns, opens safes, then exits with interior cargo. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"vigilance must root itself" and the city's locks "pause before accepting imprecise grief"—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a single on-page forfeiture or visible price. The final image reweights the premise (latent blaze held, not poured) yet the stance crystallization feels asserted more than earned by a decisive beat that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens clearly by midpoint: sensory fragments (insulator vibration, stress-crack analysis, hedgehog uncurling) accumulate into a coherent pulse-driven resolution. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (grove, sculptor role, post-storm context). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist surrenders cleverness, leaves the music embedded, and walks away—foreclosing the symphonic ambition with felt cost ("carrying the plectrum, leaving the music where it belongs"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the grove's unsaid words teach the sculptor that it wants companionship, not performance, reweighting the task. Cost is legible in the renunciation and the shift from creator to conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: density builds through chess-as-lexicon, silence-as-language, the stone fitting its hollow. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"surrender done on purpose might be a kind of song"—with visible cost (acceptance of judgment, forfeiture of control). Orientation anchors by line 6 (exile, field, twilight). The tightening occurs when the stone clicks into place and the nexus hum resolves, reweighting all prior pressure. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist accepts the promise and adds their own entry, forecloses the path of passive observation, and the cost is visible in "my throat tightens" and the dual signature. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of silence metaphors, cadence modulation (fireworks external clock), and the final image reweights the archive motif with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clasp opens and Anya's pages teach the method, which the protagonist immediately applies. Causality is clean under the chosen lens; the tuning-frequencies method and the diary's instruction enable the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with pressure building through planting, tending, and the bloom's climactic arrival. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the bridges steady, ambition softens into stewardship) with felt cost (the village "flinched as if truths had teeth," the protagonist endures the stink). The tightening is legible: restless motion → planted seed → feral bloom → equilibrium restored. One persistent constraint (olfactory sensitivity) shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (water, echoes, resin) and the final planting reconfigures the orchard's resilience with felt ancestral weight. The closure—planting the fused spindle beneath the grandmother's drum—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with Charged Poise), reweighting the premise of survival-as-practice. Cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical forfeiture, which keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Inferred lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid (investigation methodology → micro-adjustments → safe landing). Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the investigator inventories near-failures rather than celebrating success, and the unclipping of the patch signals the work's provisional nature ("the air will be different tomorrow"). Escalation tightens through the child's arrival (generator failing, chopper circling), which converts abstract survey into urgent coordination. Orientation anchors early (dawn, port, shipping containers, accident investigator) and the because/therefore chain—wind patterns between buildings trained a dust devil that threw the pilot—drives the middle third and justifies the offset corridor solution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but delays concrete stakes past the first third; the reader learns setup (bell, sheet, sculptor) without a live tightening until the synchronized strike. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush "unfettered" and living as "common air"), but cost is asserted ("hearts far away slowed") rather than demonstrated on the page for the protagonist. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and aurora-color layering build toward the final release, yet the final image lacks a visible price paid by the bell ringer that forecloses an option. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows the protagonist's forfeiture or reweighted choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the protagonist weaves the seam clean through patient technique and leaves driftwood markers as both penance and guidance, foreclosing the path of shortcuts with felt humility. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (canyon hush, threading seams, weaving metaphors) and holds through the final tightening when the market "breathed" and the seam "knit clean." One meaningful deepening occurs when the flute's note reveals the failure site and the protagonist shifts from forcing to gentling the tempo. The Orientation Test is waived: who (driven relic keeper), where (Thunder-echo range), and when (after the guardianship) anchor by the opening lines. Deduction: the breach mechanics and the "worlds wove like strands" remain somewhat abstract; the middle passage where the protagonist steps "where the air cooled in a straight, unnatural line" could benefit from sharper spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, night setting). The piece accumulates pressure through the couple's commission, the protagonist's self-examination, and the halo fragment's responses, culminating in "I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself, but its best purpose is to disorient fear"—a CR that reweights the premise with conceptual cost (acknowledging evasion). The final star-vanishing image charges this shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from hiding behind Maris to claiming ownership of ambiguity's purpose, which narrows future tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of sympathetic resonance early and pays it off when the corridor opens, then thins. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the widow and lost man overlap briefly, the tube is sealed, the yew planted—options narrow with the understanding that "miracles should not be kept past their flavor." Cost is visible in the corridor's thinning and the courier's solitary return to the path. One credible tightening (the germination sequence) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors are clear by the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (quartz arbor, pre-dawn mist, attentive mystic) and holds a Hybrid lens—Accumulative texture (frost patterns, prism refractions) tightening into a Situational crystallization when Mara's skepticism shatters. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's whispered "You planned this" and the narrator's "yes and no" answer reconfigure belief and agency with conceptual cost (she must now "carry what she had been trying to drop"). The cost is felt but slightly oblique—we infer emotional consequence rather than see a foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening (car-window communion scene) narrows Mara's stance decisively, satisfying the 600–800 word standard.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (puzzle edges, amber, memory-threads) that reweight the dominant stake—sending a message across impossible distance. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kio completes the sending, feels the pull snap back, and sits "wistful yet stilled," having paid the debt in quiet. Cost is legible ("she must thin herself," the loom empties), though the escalation is purely accretive rather than causally tightened. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fabric launches and her brother "knew he had been held."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through three nights of ritual preparation, crescendoing in the blue-fire night when Iven offers memory-cost and the rubble "sighed into shapes." The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to cadence shift): Iven's vow-work reconfigures the planet's responsiveness, and the final bell-ringing confirms the awakening with legible cost (his traded memories, bruised wrist). Orientation anchors early (orchard planet, post-quake rubble, floating arches) and the three-night structure provides clear escalation beats, though causality between silk-tightening and stone-waking remains impressionistic rather than mechanically clear.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors emerge gradually—sensory map maker, abandoned repair bay, green glass shard—but "who" and "when" cohere by approximately line 10, within the allowable window. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the withheld truth ("I was the one who pressed REDIRECT") and redirects the path outward by mapping routes for survivors, foregrounding a visible cost (carrying the weight, folding the child into the chart). The Accumulative lens holds: layered sensory details and parallel-universe threading tighten until the final image reweights prior material. However, the causal linkage between the child's touch and the fuel redirect remains abstract—"obedient to a pattern that moved me like tide"—which clouds agency and slightly weakens closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of anonymous exchange and stacked-stone semiotics early, then deepens through the lamp's death and the discovery of sea glass. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final stacking of five stones "where waves could almost reach them" and the bottling metaphor crystallize the ache with visible cost—the narrator's solitary vigil and the absent keeper. Orientation is clear by the first few lines (lighthouse keeper, lantern room, after lamp dies). One meaningful tightening occurs when the skipper arrives early and the exchange of letters and stones reweights the anonymous chain with the narrator's declaration "We are still here."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring images (beam, storm, glass) and cadence modulation rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (lighthouse keeper, post-newspaper world, Emerald tower). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final declaration "the lighthouse keeps its emerald vow to tomorrow," but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The child's arrival and her integration feel more like expansion than tightening, weakening escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of luminous observation and postural adjustment, building pressure through recurring wing/light interactions toward the final understanding of "magnetism as posture." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator stands "where the colors are almost colors, nearly seen" with the donor heart "aligning like a compass," crystallizing the learned stance with felt cost (the appointment accepted, the responsibility shouldered). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (floating tea house, post-transplant dye master). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator tilts the wing to shift story flow from courier to widow, demonstrating the discovered principle. Cost is legible in the appointment's weight and the discipline required ("threading light through patience").

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): the protagonist shifts from routine maintenance to archivist-witness, the sextant heals, and the labyrinth stops leaking—mundane miracles with conceptual cost (the role is forever changed). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through layered images (dream dust hills, tags as minutes, angles replacing words) and the cadence shift at dawn reweights the dominant stake. One hairline issue: the pin-drop moment ("at the moment a pin is heard") is dramatized but its causal trigger is slightly soft—lightning and the sextant's trembling cue the descent, yet the pin itself feels more atmospheric marker than hard pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (memory keeper), where (greenhouse), and the mirror-world frame early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woven dawn negotiates new boundaries between light and dark, communities bring spoiled names to the loom, and the protagonist's selves nest in the rafters—options are crystallized and reweighted with felt cost (shared scars, bound release). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the ledger omitted weaving across both mirror sides, tightening tactics. Cost is legible in "we, bound to the work, release our grip just enough for others to hold." The lens holds through closure without contradiction, though the middle's accumulation of lullabies, sighs, and chants could signal one causal tightening more sharply to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the protagonist and the man do not reconcile into old shapes but acknowledge the cracked spine of their relationship with visible cost ("that refusal felt like the gentlest truth available"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the stationery shop beat. The meaningful deepening occurs when both stack motives on the table and read Mistake/Wisdom aloud, which reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible: proximity as medicine is renounced, and both walk away altered but not repaired.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lists of tiny surrenders, guerrilla gardening metaphor) and builds density through tea-house uncloaking, bread-breaking communion, seed-planting. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts the ongoing work ("still a noticer, still refusing the lazy gravity of forgetting") with visible cost (feeling "lighter but not exonerated"). The tea house "locks us" beat crystallizes the contract. Minor gap: the cost is felt but could be more concretely tied to a foreclosed path; the ending gesture leans slightly toward future promise rather than present price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives within the first 120 words (frozen library, records chief role, duty with vows), satisfying that gate. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density of imagery and cadence builds toward the final vow-making act. However, the closure unit is weak: the protagonist makes a vow and "became another entry," but the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than felt on the page; no visible before/after in agency, relationship, or material consequence. The fractured pledge discovery and the directive from the library create pressure, but the resolution lacks a legible price—what option was foreclosed, what was sacrificed?

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the dominant stake (capturing trust breaking) is clear. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lark engineers false starts that braid tension until the lime-spill triggers Kettle's reach and the smuggler's recoil, producing the recorded "brittle inhale." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the sound is captured, the market resumes breathing, and Lark exits with her bottled message—but the cost is primarily atmospheric rather than a visible personal forfeiture on the final beat, keeping this just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through sensory density, motif accumulation (taste, weather, elections), and a cadence shift when the narrator moves from observation to accompaniment. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ring's taste shifts from direction to pronoun "us," the narrator accepts Mirelle's story); the cost is legible in the line "which is to say I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns." Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (bluff, aurora, narrator's sensors). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator joins Mirelle at the weatherbearer gathering and witnesses restraint over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (artist), where (carnival/boardwalk), and when (after closing) by the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the descent, crystal faces, broken lock, and charcoal-sketch solution, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Decisive Change) where the artist commits to signing pages with Vera's name, reweighting the survival-versus-calling tension. Cost is legible: "something in me has opened that will not close" forecloses the purely commercial path. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to communal action) with visible cost—the protagonist refuses solo control and forces collective witness, reweighting the city's relationship to archived truth. Orientation anchors who/where/what by line 2 (calligrapher, greenhouse city, leaf-post). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist discovers the vault, escalates through the strike, and culminates in collective opening. The postmaster's nod and the breathing jars provide felt cost. Causality holds under the accumulative lens: discovery → withheld service → gathered crowd → opened vault.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Iri) and where (bluff above clouds) within the opening lines; when ("after words become unnecessary") is conceptual but legible. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the Keepers' arrival, the shard's activation, and their departure without the fragment. Closure is Earned Stasis—Iri refuses the request, preserving wonder at the cost of withholding a document the Keepers fear losing. The cost is visible: her gloved fingers tremble, and the Keepers leave "carrying no shard, only a new slowness." One meaningful tightening (the confrontation and the sculptures' reply) sufficiently narrows options under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the android reorients its understanding of care from protocol execution to adaptive improvisation, with conceptual cost made legible in the line "systems will not allow it." The magnetic-north shift triggers escalation, the miniaturized burn is causally motivated, and the final image—"workable storm" and "carry both in a single body"—reweights the opening static. Orientation is clear by line 2 (greenhouse dusk, desert rose farm, glass dome). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tin's contents are repurposed from stored object to tactical tool. Small deduction: the mechanics of how the burn recalibrates pumps and fog remain gestural rather than concretely traced.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered testimony early and sustains it; the mailbox opens when communal ache reaches critical density, a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Cost is legible: the letters inside confirm Noemi's absence and the community's ongoing vigil replaces closure with "open library" maintenance. One meaningful deepening (Marta's and Jonah's confessions narrow the ritual from curiosity to shared vulnerability) tightens the dominant stake under accumulative logic. Causal linkage is light—stories "click some unseen tumbler"—but the lens permits metaphoric causality when the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of coded movement and marginal inscription that builds toward the liberation of drowned names; the closure lands when "the bridge carried the names back into our mouths" and the rigging hums with traffic. Orientation anchors (sunken lab, narrator + Mara, present tense) arrive clearly. One meaningful deepening occurs when doubt enters the lung and water withdraws from cabinets, reweighting the dominant stake. Cost is implied (the Warden's surveillance, the risk of discovery) but not shown as a forfeiture or visible consequence on the page. The lens holds, but the cost-proof test shows only conceptual repricing rather than felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; the narrative builds pressure through density increase and recurring motifs that converge at closure. The ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist understands their work "keeps a path through change," reweighting the opening silence and lamp-lighting ritual with conceptual cost—the acceptance that memories must be carried manually through gravitational flux. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the exhumed memory sheet opens the corridor, narrowing the quest into concrete action with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (summoner) and where (brook) early, though "when" remains atmospheric rather than clock-bound. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery until the code "untied like wet shoelaces," a Conceptual Repricing moment. However, the closure cost is asserted ("room; the future exhaled") rather than made visible through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. The link between the summoner's breath and the code's dissolution reads as metaphoric equivalence rather than earned causality, limiting the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through weekly tea sessions, roof meeting, and meteor-shower closure, each beat adding density to the "agreed upon lies" frame. Orientation anchors who (narrator, tutor), where (building stairwell, neighbor's door, rooftop), and when (weekly sessions → meteor shower night) by the first fifth. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seal-press ritual on the rooftop stone yields the building's first legible sentence, the narrator accepts custodianship, and the tutor's departure under meteor light reconfigures the relationship from student/tutor to co-sentences "looking for a wall to hold us." Cost is felt in the narrator's new obligation ("keep listening…do not be cruel with truth") and the tutor's sigh "like wood does when it remembers rain," signaling his fade into the building's memory. One mild causality gap: the building's sudden ability to speak after the seal-press feels under-prepared, though the prior lessons ("listen by asking me to stay silent") seed it.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator becomes an archive, the child disperses, the garden "satisfied"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or immediate friction appears in the final beats. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence accumulate metaphorical weight toward the ending reprise of "translate isolation into independence." Orientation is present early (garden, twilight, fountain) but the shell's mechanics and the transfer's stakes remain vague until midpoint, creating mild disorientation. The "resonance structures" method is invoked but not concretely taught, leaving the middle passage feeling more declarative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early—marble sanctuary, dripping stalactites, aurora—and accumulates pressure through layered invocations of forgiveness, unlinking, and mercy. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist leaves a margin blank and plants the thorn, refusing completion with conceptual cost ("the only honest room"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when reading the mentor's halted words reweights the mission from completion to forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the canyon visit gathers layered answers through progressive questioning, and the closure reconfigures Lio's understanding of connection with felt cost ("promises make echoes stoop to drink"). Orientation anchors quickly (canyon echo singer, nexus destination, night journey). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—Lio shifts from seeker to knot-maker with visible philosophical cost (accepting entanglement over solitude). One structural concern: the middle stretches through multiple similar question-answer cycles without a clear tightening or complication that narrows options before the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of tapping/rhythm across dreamers, maps it to evidence, and culminates in communal witness that forces corporate acknowledgment. Orientation anchors late (shrine, ice, harbor context emerge piecemally past ~120 words) but the mosaic structure is legible by midpoint. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "exposure is a gentle blade" reweights the investigation's method with social cost (foreman's lowered eyes, quiet husband's final turn). One meaningful deepening occurs when the globe's tune becomes "password" evidence. Cost is conceptual and communal rather than protagonist-personal, which is valid under CR but mutes felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through fireflies, whisk-foam patterns, and the gathering crowd, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the councilor removes his sash to dry stones and others follow—a crystallized stance-shift with visible relational cost (status gesture) that forecloses the old dismissive posture. The tightening is earned through the whisk demonstration → whistle echo → collective naming of hidden laborers, each beat reweighting the dominant stake (appreciating invisible effort). One persistent constraint (wet parapet, night timing) shapes the demonstration's form and the final collective act. Cost is legible on-page: the councilor's sash repurposed, the crowd's shift from spectators to participants.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist reweights superstition into maintenance, teaches the caretakers tuning over prayer, and walks out "steadier, having traded a curse for a calibration." The cost is visible—refusal of payment, retention only of a love note as proof that "tenderness survived bureaucracy." The drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: because the protagonist reassembles letters, the resonator's function is revealed; because the function is taught, the orchard survives the next storm. Orientation anchors arrive early (liquidation, orchard, packing shed, diamond) and the investigative structure tightens from mystery to mechanical solution. One micro turn when the protagonist realizes "I did not intuit magic; I intuited design" pivots the frame cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, storm, tea, radio). The piece accumulates pressure through fragmented radio messages, Brin's arrival, town representatives, and the seeds/lightning climax. One meaningful tightening occurs when the "prophet" shifts from abstract pattern to municipal action (Knoll offers soil, priest blesses antennae). Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: "allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine, locking ribs against the old wind" reweights the variant-allegiance premise with communal cost implied. However, the cost remains oblique—no visible forfeiture on the page, only atmospheric consequence—which keeps the closure shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the poet promises to stop jarring once the village learns to listen, forecloses his old trade, and leaves windows open to "invite tomorrow"—a visible cost and stance shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: density increases from solo jarring to village gathering, pattern breaks when the music box releases notes into jars, and the final cadence ("ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet we had chosen together") reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. Orientation anchors by line ~80 (loft, poet, dawn, jars on sill). One minor seam: the widow's backstory about her husband building the loft arrives late but pays off at closure, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Marek offers shared guardianship, the seeker accepts with visible ache, and together they commit to the work. Cost is felt in "a smile that did not hide its ache" and the renunciation of ransom. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift when sound fills the space and the seeker's hunger "shifted shape." One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of charged imagery (frozen lake, viaduct hum, moon paths) by the first third and reweights them at closure when "our patient revolution stood" in the warm basalt sanctuary with the village gathered. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator shifts from solitary observation to collective teaching, crystallizing the revolution as "not a storm but a school," with the conceptual cost legible in the phrase "how to be news" and the gathering that forecloses the narrator's prior isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the girl's question ("Who will teach us to wait without surrendering") tilts the narrator's stance from passive mapping to active instruction, narrowing options and raising the social cost of visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + renunciation): the investigator breaks institutional control, documents preventable causes, and withholds the lantern from evidence with visible cost (defying supervisor, risking career consequence). The orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. Causality holds: salt-locked drains and missed supervisor nod create the preventable drowning; the investigator's empirical method and the lantern's "entangled memories" mechanism drive the choice to sign the report as "preventable, collective, and mine to report upward." Cost is legible in the defiance and in the investigator's acceptance of responsibility. Minor deduction: the "entangled memories" device borders on convenience but is paid off through the father-workers linkage that charges the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: chaplain, shop, wounded music box. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (causal repair sequence interleaved with accumulative metaphor), coherent at closure. The escalation is clean: thorn discovered → removed → heart ticks → Jonah chooses steps, with visible cost in "nodded without asking for mercy." Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the apology becomes a map of steps he can deserve, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (workshop on acid sea, Ilex, cart glider). The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: iterative adjustments (kaleidoscope → algorithm → arrow-tip switch) lead to the bell ringing, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the achievement is conceptual and the cost is implicit ("yearning never is satisfied"). The closure lands on the page with pressure, though the conceptual cost—ringing a bell "no one hears yet"—feels more asserted than dramatized as an irreversible trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives on the page: the narrator posts the Driftwood link, and Aida's signal returns ("Still here, still counting"), delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the recurring numbers and callbacks crystallize meaning. The tightening is legible (lie → vault access → breadcrumb trail → Sink → posting), and the reweighting of "sensed absence" into presence is felt. Cost is implied in "risking my job and the hush," but the consequence remains slightly diffuse; a sharper on-page forfeiture (e.g., a lockout notification, a colleague's reaction) would anchor the price more firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors reconstitute understanding through layered glimpses, and the proposal emerges from pattern recognition rather than causal reversal. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's "smallest synchronized movement" and the narrator's decision to stay constitute Earned Stasis with visible cost (staying a season, accepting the mantle). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard reveals the historical wound, reweighting the quarrel and enabling the proposal.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate (drift-ice marina, post-change state, volunteer role). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered listening imagery, the parasol tip as sounding tool, rope memory, the child rescue, storm readiness, until the final beat reweights the opening suicidal intent into "a way home... the sound of endings arriving and passing." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator refuses the appointment again, choosing continued listening with felt cost (the buoy still blinks, the future "coming without hurry"). One meaningful deepening is clear—rescue to storm to delay—narrowing options from oblivion toward mercy. Cost is legible: the appointment persists, the narrator remains a tourist wandering edges, and home is redefined as sound rather than place.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated vineyard/love-letter imagery builds toward the traveler writing a new map-letter that binds scar to future. Orientation anchors (station, pavilion, autumn) arrive early. The closure—kneeling to carve truth and bind what survives—reconfigures the dominant stake (can she honor both rivers and rows?) with felt cost (the burned edge sealed into the map). One deduction: the sentinel's role in the closure is observation rather than decision, softening the cost's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual density and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in which the collective practice succeeds, the echo settles, and tomorrow's repetition is accepted with visible cost (the valley forgets quickly). The closure image ("feel the echo of wisdom settle against my ribs and stay") reweights the daily labor with conceptual cost made legible. Orientation anchors who (keeper), where (pavilion/valley), and the ritual stakes within the first quarter. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walker suggests widening the clearing through peripheral trust, which the narrator enacts, intensifying the ritual's success and charging the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—the piece builds density through the ritual, then deepens via the mirror reveal and the corridor walk. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the town moves from "too many years of sirens and layoffs" to "breathing with a less fractured chest," and the map case "weighs more than paper, as if it has swallowed a small future." Orientation anchors (archivist, lavender field, factory ruins, dove gray map case) land cleanly in the first ~10% and the causal chain is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror layer is revealed and the circle laughs, reweighting grief into collective agency. Cost is felt (the corridor left outdoors to weather, the mayor's fidgeting replaced by a joke) but remains somewhat oblique—no decisive path is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered sensory metaphors (crystal sounds, card labels, morning light) and deepens meaning via recurring motifs. Closure form: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights "growth" and "forgiveness" with undeniable conceptual cost (slowness, accompaniment). Orientation anchors arrive early (scholar, library, dawn, post-dictionary world). One clear deepening occurs when the scholar moves from recording intervals to understanding "the grammar of tending." Cost is legible in the renunciation of "volumes" and the acceptance of slow revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered observation, chalk-marking, listening, and driftwood arrangement; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he resets the markers knowing he will not recognize them, forecloses futurity, and exits slowly, "paying attention to the soft spool of years." The cost is legible: he surrenders the hope of capturing permanence and accepts recursive forgetting. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (junkyard prophet, fog sculpture garden, low tide). One meaningful deepening occurs when the driftwood arrows rearrange (line 20), granting "permission" and tightening his commitment to the ritual. The lens holds without contradiction. Minor penalty: the videotape references (lines 2, 24, 36) operate as ambient texture rather than causal nodes, creating slight redundancy without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the story builds through patterned repair beats (cameras, guiding motors, imager, chronometer) toward a closure image where the Moon "spoke" and the narrator "would answer." The quake serves as inciting pressure; each repair compounds understanding until the final tea scene crystallizes stance with felt cost (exhaustion, hope against habit). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the team dares to hope and commits to "restructure more than instruments"—with visible cost in the night's labor and shift from certainty to listening.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (hospice wing, therapist POV, timeframe "hours, maybe a day"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the son takes the shard without gauze and stays, the father's breath thins, and the final image ("monitors loosen their grip") reconfigures the dominant stake (flawless goodbye) with palpable cost—the father's death and the son's acceptance of fragility. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: hymning the mundane accumulates pressure through layered images (window latch, IV drip, clementine, shard) that converge at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the son arrives and the estrangement begins to yield, followed by the father's transfer of the shard; the cost is legible on the page (father dies, son commits to carry the shard).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the observatory setting and scholar role are clear. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered metaphor (spoons, automaton key, mirrors, noon-under-night) toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final third where shadows are revealed to "wait inside decisions." Cost is legible in the gold line beneath skin and the refusal to tell the caretaker, signaling an enduring obligation. One tightening suffices at this length, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (bone-setter narrator, post-substitute-body timeframe, hedge maze). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure deepens through discovered objects (tooth, sketch, Ari's emergence) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator and Ari choose mercy over the town's narrative, crystallizing stance with visible social cost ("The town would clamor tomorrow"). The tooth→sketch→Ari sequence creates motivated ellipsis and tightens options cleanly. Cost is legible in the final image: they accept tomorrow's reckoning to "hold" tonight, and the stars are reframed as witnesses rather than omens—a reweighting that reconfigures the opening's "cleft in certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garland's gentle light reconfigures the village's relationship to fire and the narrator's grief, with conceptual cost legible in the final image (brother may "finally anchor" only if he accepts patience over speed). The accumulative/textural lens holds—density increases through polishing beats, backstory interleave, and village installation, culminating in a cadence shift where "dusk and mist" replace torch-light. One meaningful deepening (polishing→stringing→village acceptance) tightens the dominant stake. Orientation anchors early (grotto, mist, tide). The brother's absence and potential return charge the ending without requiring his on-page appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (moss garden as site of transformation, drip-pattern as invitation) and deepens through layered imagery that reweights the pendant from keepsake to buried archive. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (mutual renunciation of prior harm patterns) with conceptual cost legible in the exposed chain as "umbilical of light." Orientation anchors by line ~8 (abandoned data center, viral confession context, "I" perspective). One meaningful tightening occurs when she arrives and the constellation path guides burial. Cost is felt in the line "It is not forgiveness, exactly, but it is not nothing."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered encounters and the river metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist shifts from "seeking resolution" to "arranging permission"). Orientation is established early (nexus, mist, twilight, novelist carrying shell). The closure unit lands: the choice to follow the river over the market is articulated, and the final image shows emblems "weighted like consonants" ready for use. Cost is conceptual (rejecting the market's "ladder of triumphs") but not viscerally felt on the page—no on-page consequence or forfeiture that narrows options. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (anchors present); Lens ambiguity deduction is not applied (Accumulative holds). One meaningful deepening occurs (wading into the contrary current), sufficient for this length, but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.7)
    The piece establishes a lyric-accumulative design but fails the Orientation Test: by ~120 words we have "verdant arbor," "village," and "fields" without anchoring who the narrator is, their relationship to Rowen, or what specific practice has lapsed. The closure—"the remedy took" and "sacred practices returned"—declares success but lacks a decisive change or visible cost; bowls mend and wells echo without on-page consequence or foreclosed option. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead the text offers unearned restoration. Orientation debt triggers −0.4 and caps per the global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational frame—pressure accrues through image density and pattern-building (orchard → plate → ampoule → lake fissure) until the final sealing reconfigures the world's stasis into guided breath. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (alchemist, subarctic crater orchard, post-silence epoch). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the fitted plate and unsealed fissure allow the aurora to step and hearts to beat into guiding lines, reweighting the prior stillness with conceptual cost (the world can move again, but only along translated routes). One visible causal tightening: the closed-eye bark responds to starlight, validating his method and narrowing the path to the lake center. Cost is conceptual and environmental rather than personal—legible but oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds throughout: the locksmith's repeated acts of mapping, repairing, whispering, and harvesting create a meaningful density increase that culminates in his choice to leave the timer behind and return to town with sealed jars. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he completes the harvest and accepts the constraint that "some keys should stay where they learn," foreclosing possession with visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive early (marble cavern, dawn, valley road repairs). One small friction: the transition from cavern work to town cellar compresses several days in a single paragraph, slightly softening the escalation curve before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (bronze grotto, post-snowmelt, narrator with lamp) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the catalog of burdens, each reweighting the central task until the narrator's own fear is named and repositioned with visible cost ("the fear found a shelf where it could stand without gnawing"). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final image of carrying the ledger into thawing streets with "each weight its chosen way to rest" reconfigures the opening vow without negating prior pressure. One meaningful deepening (the personal fear) tightens options and the cost is legible on the page, though the shift could land with sharper forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure accumulates through ritual constraint (kettle's duration), the carving's gradual revelation, and rain's parallel lesson. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (widow, loft, morning ritual). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she wraps the incomplete carving, opens the window, arranges three objects "like a new ring"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (the collar remains unfinished, absence preserved). One persistent constraint (the kettle's timeframe) shapes all tactics. Cost is legible: she refuses completion, trains memory to come without treats, and the final exhale signals a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is evident: the piece builds through patterned recursion (carousel, lagoon, ghost, camera wheel) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the ghost "fades not from absence but from agreement, leaving tools in my hands." Cost is conceptual—the protagonist accepts restarted habits over plundered futures—and the final image reweights ambition as "sand good for gardens." Orientation is delayed (kinetic lagoon, scavenger role) but purposeful compression coheres by midpoint. One meaningful deepening (ghost materializes, truce negotiated) tightens the stake sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terminal "no longer pretending to be empty" and the intern sleeping with "wonder steadied by work" crystallize the shift from abandoned ruin to functioning mercy with visible cost (tomorrow's "proportional headaches"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered flows (rain, power, air) and the cadence shifts from diagnostic observation to collaborative action. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The cost is both felt (exhaustion, ongoing maintenance) and conceptual (hope as "tested by maintenance").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues resonance through recurring images (bells, keys, clocks, crystal forecourt) and a cadence shift at closure reweights the abandoned dream from shame to companionship. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 2. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist shifts from "make peace" to "keep meeting…until both of you are home"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page forfeiture or visible price is legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens, but the felt cost at closure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the canal setting and quest are clear. The piece follows a causal lens: the protagonist retrieves the box, reads the evidence, confronts the engineer, and together they choose a new path—a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving behind silence for action, forfeiting anonymity). One meaningful tightening occurs when the letters reveal family complicity, narrowing the protagonist's options from abstract justice to personal reckoning. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: "leaving ripples like new lines on a map" signals irrevocable exposure and partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established but diffuse: the golden dock, harbor fog, and seed-collecting mission are signaled, yet who/where/when coalesce slowly across multiple paragraphs rather than anchoring by ~120 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through knot-reading beats and the final image of shared vigil—but escalation remains flat; no reversal or tightening narrows options or raises cost. Closure reads as Charged Poise (the protagonist and fisherman "kept" by the harbor), but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt or visible on the page, weakening the closure unit's impact. The lens holds, but the lack of meaningful pressure reduces structural cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (harbor, garden, narrator's role) arrive early. The closure—woman reads, weeps, receives the thread as pilgrim trail—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: her shoulders "learn a slope that a future can rest on"). Cost is felt but oblique: she must navigate her house differently, and the man remains absent. The palace thread and quince-drop approval charge the final image, though the causal chain is thin; the narrative relies on density and cadence shift rather than because/therefore links.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes images and motifs (egg, chains, gears, lullabies) toward a final transformation when the creature hatches and the palace "learns to hesitate." Orientation anchors who (prince), where (suspended palace), and rough situation by the opening lines, satisfying the test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the creature's song reweights the mechanical world with a crossroads given breath), and conceptual cost is legible in the prince's renunciation of conquest for caretaking. However, the accumulation lacks a single sharp tightening or deepening mid-text; the texture intensifies gradually without a clear pivot that narrows options before the hatch. The final image charges prior material, but the path from assembly to outcome feels more like inexorable unfolding than causal linkage, which is acceptable under Accumulative but limits band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation quickly (dunes, lagoon, her role) and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coin-swing ritual, black sand sprinkling, and grafting action layer pressure through recurring objects and gestures. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy's smile signals forgiveness-by-wind, the coin is pinned where drafts test it, and she becomes "the opposite of a fuse." Cost is conceptual and felt—she carries the tide's engine and measures days by songs released—but the final image's reweighting is oblique; the cost of this teaching (time, vulnerability, the weight she continues to carry) is stated more than shown in a decisive closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density build through breadcrumb-following beats toward a final image of remembering-as-patience. Orientation arrives by ~80 words (city, Ilias, stained glass box, mission). One meaningful deepening occurs when the broker is refused and the grandmother's image appears, reweighting the quick-flood temptation. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "patience was not waiting but remembering together" reframes the premise with conceptual cost (slow, communal work vs. easy relief), and the final line anchors the next cycle. Cost is conceptual and felt but not viscerally dramatized on the page; the broker's departure and fountain trickle suggest progress without a decisive forfeiture that narrows Ilias's future options.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns around echoes, petals, and the sonar method, then deepens via the child's counted prayers and the captain's recognition. Orientation anchors quickly (nebula garden, falling petals, first-person keeper). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator will repeat the cycle ("when the next descendants arrive, I will touch the gear and begin the sonar pinging once more"), honoring the pattern without repeating its wound. Cost is conceptual—eternal repetition as mercy—and legible in the final lines. One meaningful deepening (travelers switch off their burn and receive lamps) meets the 600–800 word gate, though the cost is more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final kite curve reweights the migration, ribbons, and collective grief premise with undeniable pressure and felt cost (the father's loaf, the seasonal arc completed). Orientation anchors promptly (greenhouse, dusk, carver's tools by line 2). One escalation beat—storm testing the roof, nothing breaks—deepens the grief-as-structure motif. Cost is legible in the father's steadied hand and the carved pauses. Minus 0.2 for slight lens drift in mid-section between lyric accumulation and causal ribbon-use.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, interleaved reflection, tidal ridge motif) and holds coherence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the winder releases the pendulum after adjustment, restoring shared rhythm; the final image—ridge answering tower, fisherman beside him carving a name—reweights "balance" from mechanical precision to communal listening with visible cost (public correction forgiven, isolation ended). Orientation anchors are clear by the opening: harbor, dawn, clock tower. One tightening deepens: the pause at pendulum crest where past injuries surface, then the adjustments ("oil a pivot," "whisper names"), then release and descent to the fisherman. Cost is on the page: apologies offered, bread brought, correction withheld. The lens holds without contradiction. Minor deduction: the middle section leans heavily on reflective interiority; while it remains anchored to present stimuli (the pendulum's pause, the ridge's emergence), a second concrete on-page micro-choice before the fisherman encounter would sharpen escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" arrives by line 2, but "where" (cemetery silo interior) and "when" (nighttime post-clock-rundown) coalesce slowly across the opening third. The accumulative/textural lens holds—echoes, threads, and earth-tapping build density—but closure relies on exposition (letters reveal the widow's confession) rather than a final image that reweights prior material with cost. The cost of truth-telling (planting poppies, naming her) is asserted in the penultimate paragraph but not felt as a decision that forecloses another path. A Resonant Reconfiguration is present but muted by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrator layers modeling iterations, images (kingfisher, ice, hinges), and reflective blocks to reweight the dominant stake—designing an archive that balances innovation and constraint. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~80 words (obsidian spire, frozen lake, tonight). The closure unit is Charged Poise: the final lines crystallize the mandate ("must prevail without vanquishing, must invite without drowning, must continue") and the poised moment before inscription, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative design coheres but the ending tilts toward declaration rather than image that undeniably reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the dust becomes fluent, the broadcast fades, and the protagonist commits to perpetual listening with the cadence marker "within my ribs." Cost is felt in the ongoing devotion and the cloaked, hidden nature of the work. One meaningful deepening occurs when Cinder asks for a listener "measure for measure" and the protagonist answers, shifting from solitary copying to collaborative testimony. The lens holds consistently through patterned accumulation of musical metaphor and dust-as-language.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ash-scattering and object recursion by the first third; closure arrives on-page when the chair slows under the skylight and Mother acknowledges "we have said enough," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that makes the cost of disclosure legible. Orientation anchors (narrator, mother, house room, gallery) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when visitors "fill the gaps with their own ghosts," reweighting the mirage premise. Cost is visible in Mother's squeeze and the somber exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the flood timeline creates a because/therefore chain (silt buildup → jammed gates → imminent drowning → the walk through the library → the cog-as-tool climax). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the wheel catches, the sluice opens, and the narrator keeps the cog, crystallizing the stance that "not all rebellion is arson" with visible cost (the three factions' narratives are now "damp," their authority undercut). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the noon deadline forces the walk, and the cost is legible in the final image of sodden authority and retained tool. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early (sedimentary layers, collecting shards) and pays it off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers rehearsal beats toward a performance closure that reweights the dominant stake (unlearning hatred through shared song). Orientation is clear by line 3 (Mara, velvet library, autumn). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the performance and rosette-passing ritual), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than legible on the page—no visible foreclosed path, no trade-off that narrows options. The phrase "carrying a traveled stillness home" gestures toward transformation but does not land a decisive before/after with dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes sensory detail, memory fragments, and pruning beats toward a final image of communal gathering; pressure deepens through the alignment countdown and the protagonist's ritual choices. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the chef commits to public healing despite ordinance threat, and the soup becomes the vehicle. Orientation anchors promptly (rusted greenhouse, drowned district, celestial alignment), and the pattern teaches accumulative logic early. Cost is legible in the final beat: exposure and defiance of council order.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through density and charged callback (nectar dusk bookends, lacquer box seed → crown payoff), and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the keeper's work is reweighted from solitary ritual to shared purpose with visible cost (the box leaves with Mara). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the desk setup. One meaningful deepening occurs when the riddle is solved and the hidden tray is revealed, narrowing the keeper's control and opening the tower. Cost is legible: the keeper surrenders the hidden object and ascends with Mara, forgoing isolation. No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: three house visits build density through increasing intimacy (observation → interaction → understanding). The final image achieves Conceptual Repricing—houses live "on the inadvertent ritual of attention"—reweighting all prior encounters with undeniable conceptual cost (the narrator's role as witness is redefined). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the third house "wanted me to know," narrowing from external observation to reciprocal relationship, though the cost could be more viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening third: Oris, underwater garden, post-confession. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—cascading revelations deepen through the ampoule's threading, each inch unlocking rooms of memory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where patience and depth are crystallized without drowning. Cost is legible: certainty reopens to nuance, the breach becomes a "listening wound," and the scholar's report gains pauses. One meaningful deepening (the ampoule's true function as tempo, not toxin) reweights the premise and holds the lens to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator stops seeking exit and reshapes the corridor into a remembering instrument, accepting perpetual motion with visible cost (the rupture seals to a luminous seam, precisely remembered). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through mathematical proofs, chalk marks, and the dice ritual, culminating in a cadence shift ("I climb on, in no time, toward no landing, with everything finally in place"). Cost is legible: the narrator forgoes arrival and release, crystallizing into an instrument of attention. Orientation anchors emerge by the third paragraph (infinite staircase, lone climber, chalk and dice in hand). One meaningful deepening: the rupture opens, the narrator declines to step through, and the final proof reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the pattern of painting faces and receiving offerings, culminating in the neighbor's return with the map and closure in shared tea. Orientation anchors (Lina, greenhouse, waxing moon) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the neighbor confirms the kindness loop, the final gold dot is placed, and the piece crystalizes its premise without a decisive external change. Cost is implied (years of insomnia, anonymous labor) but not sharpened in the final beat; the tea-brewing feels more affirming than foreclusive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the neighbor presents the map, reweighting Lina's solitary ritual into a shared practice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through layered images (beeswax, limestone, bread, wax softening) and a pattern-taught rhythm that culminates in the final reconfiguration where the curator accepts seasonal caretaking. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I promised to return seasonally, to carry their methods outward like bees carry rumor" reconfigures the museum role with felt cost (endurance, altered vocation). The orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph, and causality coheres under the accumulative lens. One weakness: the stranger's late arrival and revelation about the beekeeper's death feels convenient rather than causally earned, though it does not break the dominant closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis: the protagonist lets the yoyo climb and refuses the door, choosing the keeper with visible forfeiture of "unbroken mornings" and the chance to escape fate's design. The causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds—mechanical puzzle-solving escalates through reverse-engineering beats, hunger stone activation, and vision of alternate timelines, then tightens to a renunciation. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, keeper, chamber) appear early. One micro turn (seeing the keeper's potential death) reweights the choice without breaking coherence. Cost is legible: "desire shook me apart into cogs and screws" and the supernatural door closes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (midway, tarps, advisor, funhouse). The piece moves through a coherent sequence: resuscitation → advisor's bargain → funhouse entry → paradox trap → shadow confrontation → escape. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator's name and face return after the shadow confesses) with conceptual cost legible in "fear owes me money" and the ongoing debt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow "bled nouns" and revealed its weakness. Lens holds, though the causal chain leans heavily on the advisor's direction rather than protagonist discovery, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the orchard survives through the protagonist's sustained translation of threat into rhythm, and the final image ("listened to the clouds rewrite their letters into silence") reweights the opening premise with felt cost (vigilance, continuous labor). Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 2). One meaningful deepening when the gale's "mouth" forces escalation to the tower of crates. Cost is legible: unrelenting work, physical and mental toll visible in "restless euphony of repairs."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (spiral motifs, pattern languages, incremental revelation) and holds it through closure. The ending delivers Charged Poise: the protagonist steps into the corridor of glare with the third whistle note, crystallizing options and reconfiguring the watcher-city relationship with undeniable cost (becoming a "unit of distance" like her mother). Cost is legible in "I am ready to be measured" and the final image of light "ringing like a bell." One meaningful deepening occurs when the ledger reveals the expedition's fate and the watchers' true function as measures, not mercies.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discoveries (ledger, charred slips, photograph, compass) that deepen rather than reverse. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator crystallizes their method ("tell the truth without contempt") and commits to publishing both findings and methodology, a stance that forecloses the grandfather's "noble lies" path with visible cost—ending the cycle of erasure. Who/where/when anchors land early (fictional historian, disused railway station, after the final petal). The pattern of discovery → reflection → moral framing teaches the lens by midpoint and pays off in the final street scene where "time were relieved to be recorded instead of erased."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly (surveyor, submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge-rise ritual). The closure—"I was here not to repair the past but to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the surveyor's task from restoration to witness-bearing, with felt cost in the solitary, unglamorous repetition. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note-placing shifts from measurement to custody ("wrestling is not only for rage, it is for custody and for care"). Deduction: the cost remains oblique and emotional rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The blackout creates a clear before/after in sonic environment, allowing evidence to "stand out from rumor like ink separating from water." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ossa hides the stamp "not to hoard it, but to keep it near the words that understood its weight"—a refusal that forecloses broadcast and accepts the cost of patience. The cost is conceptual (truth remains local, not proclaimed) but legible in the final image. Escalation operates through density increase and pattern break (each stamped document tightens the alternative hypothesis). One meaningful deepening: the registrar's margin note pivots the flood from accident to complicity, reweighting all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through ritual repetition (polishing, steeping cranes, releasing lanterns) and deepens via the final shadow touch. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after the basilica introduction (~15% in), causing brief disorientation but no permanent harm; waive the Orientation Test penalty because the pattern pays off at closure. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow loosens rather than returns, forecloses reunion, ache "no longer drags"), and the cost is felt ("does not return to him"), satisfying the on-page requirement. One micro turn (vision ruptures, shadow walks in) and one deepening (the hand touches his chest) provide sufficient tightening under the accumulative lens. Causality within beats is sometimes elided (how do vapor cranes capture grief? how does the abbess know his need?) but the textural design tolerates motivated ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (drone strike survivor, night physicist), where (floating observatory), and when (during cooling cycle) by the first few paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory detail and the recurring geode motif, culminating in a cadence shift ("I swear I can feel it lift us") that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is felt in the vow to remain "open and unclean," but the closure leans toward Charged Poise without a sharper on-page consequence; the final image charges prior material yet the alteration of options remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three. The accumulative design layers drone work, matrix chip translation, and collaborative decoding toward a Conceptual Repricing: "belonging is not found but tuned" reweights the opening stake. Cost is oblique—the pilgrim "tucks it under their tongue," the dome rotates "with us"—but the final image of shared cadence and mutual trust reconfigures the initial isolation with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when silence is recognized as letter (~midpoint), shifting the translation method and enabling the climactic printout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors within the opening beat: cobalt terrace at dusk, guilt-ridden genealogist, Mara arriving. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shore excavation densifies meaning through layered driftwood discoveries until the watch hand reappears and Mara names the withheld truth, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + partial repricing). The final decision—burn the lies, keep one page—forecloses the old practice with felt cost. One micro weakness: the transition to Parliament of Wood could anchor spatial distance more concretely, but closure integrity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the negotiator stands alone with the cooled drawer pull after successfully brokering the exchange, the cost legible in the widening parapet and thinning mist that signal temporary relief but ongoing cyclical work. The causal lens holds cleanly—each exchange decision flows from prior negotiation ("names of hunger moved quicker than names of sovereignty"), and the protagonist's choices (showing the pull, invoking shared history) earn the final moment of respite. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second trade snags on a misremembered name, raising stakes before resolution. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words. Minor gap: the conceptual cost of this being one exchange in an endless cycle could be slightly more felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the kayak journey layers regret, the humming poles, the boy's need, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the narrator steadies—"not fixed but steadied"—with visible cost in the final image of carrying sorrow like a chart. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (coastal launch, fog, kayak, poles). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: the narrator steps out "carrying sorrow the way a captain carries a chart, open and used," foreclosing the retreat that ruled the first half. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's need interrupts the penance loop, reweighting the dominant stake from self-imposed exile to tentative re-engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the descent, newspaper clues, and the confrontation with the machine; the final image of rowing toward others reweights the opening "clean slate" premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist commits to ferrying others, which crystallizes a new stance with felt moral cost. The orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early) and the causal chain holds under the accumulative lens. Escalation is present but single-point: the baseball warming is the only true pressure pivot before the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—layered images of spices, ash, breath—and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "our bond hums, paradoxically steady, a quiet star threaded through two throats." Cost is legible in the narrator's loss of "plain speech of markets" and the ongoing condition of being a passage. Orientation anchors (orchard, moonlight, narrator's grief) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator accepts metamorphosis and opens "a seam beneath the ribs," reweighting the bond from memory to embodied passage.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the glade pilgrimage, chamber descent, and confession sequence build pressure through layered imagery and ritual acts that narrow emotional options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final tracing of hands "new lines crossing the old ones" reweights prior material with felt cost—acknowledgment that failures will recur but stance toward them has shifted. Orientation anchors quickly (cartomancer, midnight glade, post-birth). One meaningful deepening occurs when stalled seconds are named and released, transforming abstract guilt into embodied atonement with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric fragments, thematic density) and deepens pressure through the weight-balance constraint until the final turn when the lock opens and reveals seeds rather than weapons. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I sealed the door behind me, but not with locks; I stitched a promise along the seam with my breath" reweights the entire opening stake with visible cost (renunciation of conquest, acceptance of tending). Orientation anchors are present by line three (ship, caretaker, post-human timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the chamber holds "a library that taught the art of beginning again," which narrows the mission from unlocking to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (bottle-by-bottle accumulation) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: Mara's "texture of transformation" is reweighted as evacuation-as-ritual, with the cost felt in her disavowal of heroism and the elders' prophecy claim she cannot escape. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mountain exhales and the rehearsed choreography proves its worth, narrowing options retroactively and validating the orchestrated coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and atmosphere build toward a resonant reconfiguration where the fort "becomes a lighthouse that agrees to listen." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Cost is conceptual—dimming the fort to "make room for eyes to learn their own night"—but remains abstract; no specific forfeiture or visible tradeoff is dramatized on the page. The blackout enables rather than tightens, and Rhun's conversion lacks causal preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the eel herder trades places with the brother, and the protagonist inherits her work. The causal chain (promise → quest → ritual → rescue → exchange) holds under a causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral becomes a door and the rescue attempt forces the choice. The Orientation Test is borderline—"tidal bluff under aurora" and "season after friction disappears" are anchored by ~80 words, though the metaphysical rules take longer to clarify; waiving penalty as the disorientation serves the world-building and is functional by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: storm imagery, constellation motifs, and cartography language recur and build density. Orientation anchors appear late—who/where/when crystallize only after the caretaker's first line, well past 120 words—but the disorientation does not pay off at closure, triggering the −0.3 penalty. Closure attempt is Conceptual Repricing (the poet understands the cartography of scars), but cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what path is foreclosed or what the poet sacrifices to gain this knowledge. The final image ("healed page drying") offers metaphorical resonance without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early and clearly (atrium, brook, protagonist with mechanical arm, waiting for courier). The inferred lens is Hybrid-Situational with lyric texture: pressure accumulates through the sundial puzzle and Rook's arrival, then the climactic fencing beat narrows options and the floor-gate revelation offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the three signatures admit defeat-and-passage simultaneously with conceptual cost legible in "the invitation to lose and proceed simultaneously." One concern: the courier's non-arrival and the geometry-unlocking feel slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality, though the piece teaches a pattern of indirection early enough to support it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through the night's reconstruction work toward the final exchange and dawn image. Orientation anchors who (vagrant poet) and where (rusted library) by line 4, when (moon clearing skyline) by line 6—within the allowable window. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "let us practice until dawn" crystallizes the resistance-as-practice stance with felt cost implicit in the transience framed earlier. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it, but the cost of the narrator's imminent molting is asserted rather than made undeniable on the page, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly: pianist, station concourse, afternoon. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered imagery (clock, film, arbor, compasses) and a cadence shift at the encore that reweights the timetable with the train delay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the concourse pauses, schedules bow, and the hush holds "grateful patience," reconfiguring the rigid station world. Cost is felt conceptually (defiance of fate, risk to order) but the stakes remain atmospheric rather than personal; no specific path is visibly foreclosed for the pianist himself. Linkage is motivated by symbolic logic rather than causal necessity, which fits the chosen lens but keeps the emotional price oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (fantasy island reality checker), where (ancient ridge), and when (before monsoon) by line three. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: scattered dream testimony, pollen coating, conch echoes, and the metronome count cohere into the single act of planting the seed at "a hollow shaped like a sleeping ear." That moment crystallizes the dispersed voices into a sprouted thread of light that "sorted myth from memory," reconfiguring the island's self-correction capacity—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the island "would keep waking itself") with conceptual cost (the boasting and curses are released). The causal chain from dream-walking to Iru's arrival to the seed's recognition is clean, and the monsoon's arrival as punctuation rather than erasure lands the closure image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: narrator, post-severance, islet, rain-washed paths. The accumulative lens holds: compass ticking → lace instructions → cove recognition → spoken apology → color emergence → vow to teach differently. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist releases control ("pruning only what asked") with conceptual cost legible in the final blue instruction and the compass pocketed warm. One persistent constraint—the ghost ship's compass as oracle—shapes tactics throughout. The narrative teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off without causality breaks.

    Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to decryption to reunion; closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the reconfigured brotherhood and planned truth-telling. Orientation anchors early, and persistent constraint of the brother's hiding shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the courier's new mission and the oracle's sacrifice are legible in the final image.

Causality is coherent and motivation-driven even in a lyric mode, with no orientation debt. The cost—renouncing drama in favor of patience—is conceptually present but could be shaded with sharper on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: returning after an attempt on their life → using the ledger and frost to decode routes → recognizing the rival → formulating a specific plan involving the guild and the canyon. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they choose neither to erase nor conventionalize evidence but to embed it in glass and environment, with a clear conceptual and personal cost. Causality holds under a lyric mode, though the investigative leap from frost pattern to quarry and rival is fairly compressed and partially intuitive. The understated, non-confrontational ending fits the mode but slightly softens felt external stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: one primary present-tense performance braided with a few well-anchored flashbacks (capsize, first failed attempt, riverbank recalibration). Causality is clear under that lens: ferry loss → vow to translate → first misreading disaster → algorithmic/ritual correction → current disciplined session. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: the narrator recommits to this work, carrying the case home “like a lantern,” with the cost (ongoing labor and grief) implicit but legible. There are no major orientation or lens slips; the pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: package → underwater library journey → manual and ritual → confrontation with the “mantled thing” → reconfigured signal and addresses → new stasis. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal underpinning, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where distress signals become invitations to rest. Cost is legible in his self-binding to this new duty and in the risk of “miscall[ing] storms” with a broken lens. Orientation (who/where/what-now) is solid from the first lines, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: sanctions → creation of the bell ritual → expansion into food runs → direct test by the patrol → adjusted tactics → spring repricing the bell. Causality is tight under a textural lens—each new pressure (rationing, lists, patrols) deepens rather than resets the situation. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: winter’s survival system becomes spring’s visible, safer gratitude, with the bell now ringing thanks instead of risk. The cost—months of fear, secrecy, and the personal risk Mara runs during the patrol scene—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural structure: arrival → ritual with camera and vial → vision of past life → decision to “heal what we hoarded” → shared breathing with the stranger. Causality under that lens is clear: the Kwan Yin water triggers deeper access to memory, which then reframes her use of the camera and breath. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she adopts an ongoing practice (“I do not spill or drown; I decant”) and the bridge “breathes easier,” signaling a before/after shift with conceptual cost. Stakes remain mostly internal and gentle, but they do resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: each use of the halo fragment deepens temporal dislocation and grief until the descent underwater and the reformed ring crystallize a new stance. Causality is clear within its lyric mode—touching the shard reorganizes the garden, leading to pavilion, frames, fire scene, underwater vault, and finally the acceptance of the present as “a continual photograph fading.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the shard becomes a ring and its light lays a path, with the cost of living inside perpetual fading made explicit. Structure is unified and legible despite its surrealism; there are no orientation or lens-clarity failures.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: wall comes down → cover to enter → puzzle to access vault → enforcers intervene → she impedes them and escapes with seeds → distributes them beyond the wall. The drive feels Hybrid (causal with a strong textural layer), but the closure is unmistakable: Mara shifts from infiltrator to carrier/teacher, and the city from walled scarcity to breached possibility. Costs are legible: she abandons tools (the arrow), stays bound by the chain, and accepts a fugitive, itinerant future. Structure is tight and continuous despite the lyricism; no set-up is dropped (keys, arrow, chain, wall all pay off by the end).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the world and method are established, a test case with the diver proves function, and then the narrative tightens around the narrator’s own unresolved betrayal. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: discovering the “soft ripple before betrayal arrives” redefines the project from retroactive damage control to anticipatory awareness. Causality is lyric but legible—each new object (compass, bowl, plate) follows from the prior beat’s attempt to solve the same core problem. Cost is clear in the emotional exposure at the old bench and in the acceptance that knowing the prelude to rupture won’t guarantee painless outcomes, only more conscious ones.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is quiet but firm: bouquet → secret instructions → hidden room → failed negatives → reinterpretation with moonbeams → craft redefined. The drive lens reads Hybrid, with causal beats in service of a thematic/accumulative closure that conceptually reprices what “theft” and “illumination” mean. Closure is on-page and legible: “I was still the golden-hour portrait thief, but now I knew what I had always stolen” crystallizes a before/after with a clear conceptual cost. No orientation or lens-clarity debt; every set-up (bouquet, jar, destiny’s door) pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build from arrival to reconfigured purpose, with no orientation or causality slips. Beats follow a clear because/therefore chain: entering → assembling heat → transforming glass → planning communal use → re-shelving the bookmark at a new chapter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the manual’s warning against haste is re-sited at “the chapter where care and risk meet,” with his new stance crystallized. Stakes remain relatively quiet, but the arc is coherent and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of mistaken identity → seeking the library’s answer → decrypting the cast → opening the box → rooftop confrontation and joint decision. The accumulative motifs (shell, stars, rusted stacks) support a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens without muddying orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they commit to returning credits and telling the truth, with the emotional and professional cost obvious though not yet paid. A minor limit is that external danger (debts, knives) remains offstage, so the situational threat feels slightly abstract at the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a single, continuous, accumulative scene: climb, consultation, confession, choice, parting, and quiet resumption. Causality holds—his skepticism → participation in listening → confession of his mission → her reframing → his decision to carry the book—while the lyric surface never obscures who is where, doing what. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: their options and stances are different at the end (he now bears a new “mission,” she accepts staying with the erasures), and the cost is legible in his disobedience and her physical sacrifice. The piece resists overt plot mechanics, but within an accumulative lens the before/after is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: loops of the courtyard and violin gradually deepen understanding of the “second chance program” and the robot’s stance. Causality is soft but consistent—each loop builds from previous observations toward the realization that the program offers practice, not erasure, which is a clear conceptual reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the outset, and the loop mechanics are taught early enough to frame expectations. Closure lands on the page with cost in the acceptance of endless practice, though the emotional and situational stakes stay relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: failed projector → communal mistrust → narrator’s secret possession of the lens → deciphering doodles → public projection and reconciliation. Orientation (who/where/what is wrong) is established early and remains clear despite the lyric mode. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: he returns the lens, risks censure, and the square’s social dynamic shifts from suspicion to shared trust. The main limitation is that the cost of his risk, while acknowledged, resolves somewhat gently, so the climax feels slightly low-pressure for the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rituals → maze’s new corridor → confrontation at the false marble → confession and acceptance → quiet reconciliation pass logically and rhythmically. The dominant stake (proving the garden knows him / moving beyond luck) is tested when the maze punishes his deception, and the resolution is a resonant reconfiguration, not a soft reset. Closure has visible cost—he surrenders control-through-luck for mutual trust—and is crystallized in the unlatched gate and dimmed meters. Causality and patterning hold under an Accumulative/Textural lens without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine: mantas don’t arrive → Jae suspects sideways time → he builds and powers the probe → maps the nexus → inverts the fields → mantas return → he marks and records offsets, arriving at a quiet closure. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the situation is restored but reweighted by his new, intimate relation to time and proof. Stakes and costs are relatively low-key—the surge risk and potential damage to the station are hinted rather than dramatized—so the arc leans on conceptual payoff more than jeopardy. For this length and mode, the structure is tight and satisfying, though a slightly sharper articulation of what might be lost if the attempt failed could deepen the ending’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: program → stains-as-code → mapped reflections → secret room → baton → conducting silence, each beat reweighting the central task without breaking lyric flow. Causality is legible even inside the surreal logic, and the world’s rules (water, light, in-between spaces) are honored in the climax when the narrator must step on reflections to cross. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: the drowning loop is “disrupted,” and the house is allowed to rest, with the baton symbolically pocketed. The cost—risk of re-drowning, psychic burden of becoming her conductor—is implicit but tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story holds a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: arrival → ritual with the gentian → balance test → confession on the scale, all chained by the drive to “find the weight of a swallowed truth.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator finally speaks the diagnosis and feels tension ease while the storm arrives “like a mercy that hurts,” clearly marking a before/after stance toward the lie. Causality is subtle but present (smudge → soot line → balance test → scale confession), and the cost of change is on the page. A hair more external resistance or complication in the middle could sharpen the sense of narrowing options rather than a mostly smooth guided process.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: radio panic → mapped patterns → tunnel → valve → experiment → realization → reconfiguration. Backstory about the father and partner is efficiently interleaved and always tilts the present action, never stalling it. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when he forgives the wheel, restores the flow, and walks out with a new stance toward truth and belief, with the “ghost shift” recast as habit and fear. The only restraint on a higher score is that escalation remains relatively quiet and internal, without a sharply marked external turn or risk spike.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: we move from establishing the catacomb-library and oath, through disturbances (crawling letters, mushroom alphabet, rising river), to the regenerative obsidian refuge and a clarified stance. Causality is impressionistic but legible—flood → swan-guided burrowing → obsidian room → deepened understanding of regenerative silence. Orientation (who/where/rough when) is clear early, so the strangeness feels purposeful rather than disorienting. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration, with the final image reweighting prior motifs around the decision to keep witnessing lightly, tethered by silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous eclipse-afternoon scene that accumulates pressure as light fades, stories are shared, and Ada’s locket moves from guarded object to communal resonator. Causality is subtle but firm under an accumulative/textural lens: because the eclipse is coming, the therapist organizes the gathering; because he seeks “ordinary magic,” he invites details; because Ada responds, he proposes the locket’s incorporation into the music. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Ada’s stance toward her grief and night-time solitude shifts, with the lullaby request marking a new option and cost. Orientation is solid from the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: we move from premise (post-dream world) through investigation (diaries, tapestry, flue) to an interpretive turn (understanding the displaced axis) and a new stance at the end. The causal line is soft but present—probing the fireplace leads to the brass disk, which recontextualizes both the tapestry and the axis, and prompts his reorganization of the library and his choice to “volunteer” as listener. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the axis shift is re-read as unseating dreams, and his work becomes a compensatory world-stitching, with cost implied in his role absorbing stranded stories. The piece maintains orientation in who/where/when despite its lyricism, and the pattern it teaches early holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is clean early: harbor, island, job, envelope, and stakes all anchor within the first few paragraphs. Causality holds: specs → decision to go to lighthouse → re-engineering fortunes → light-broadcast → town’s reaction → agent’s misread report, forming a coherent accumulative structure. Closure lands as a strong resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the town moves from pretense to mutual acknowledgment under the line “You already know,” with the protagonist accepting their role as arranger. The cost is conceptual and social rather than dramatic, but it is legible: secrecy as protective habit is surrendered for a more exposed communal self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: chapel as anchor → imminent permanent tilt if possession completes → Father Ilario’s arrival → successive rhetorical tactics → displacement of the whisper into the palette and Mara’s re-choice. The drive lens reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, with rhetorical patterns escalating pressure while each device yields concrete shifts in Mara’s state. Closure is decisive and on-page—the possession evaporates, the street straightens, the anchor hums—and the cost is legible in the revealed nature of the contract and Mara’s renunciation of it. The structure is a single, continuous ritual scene with no orientation issues and one clear tightening arc.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is controlled and coherent: present ritual → mapped memories → environment joining the “orchestra” → conceptual revaluation of the fortunes. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration: fortunes, breath, and listening are reweighted, and the imagined diner at the end crystallizes the before/after. Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic, so the cost at closure (the toll of attention, the acceptance of listening-as-art instead of grand command) is felt but quiet rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: arrival on viaduct → tablet activation → guided traversal → realization at middle arch → renunciation of hovering and tablet. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: choosing to walk and erase the seed reconfigures what “conquest” and “gravity defiance” mean. Causality is clear within the chosen mode—the tablet’s pattern leads to the central arch, where the key realization and choice occur—and there are no orientation issues. The cost of ending the looped instant and surrendering an extraordinary ability is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → collaboration → experiment with reversed tracks → discovery of the filament → repair of the needle → departure with a reoriented mission. Causality is legible and anchored in concrete actions, with each step logically answering the previous beat. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mara leaves with a new tool and a reframed understanding of silence and teaching, with visible future implications. Stakes are internal but coherent; a slightly sharper moment of potential failure or setback in the middle would strengthen structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly one continuous scene with a clear throughline: being followed, the pigeon’s warning, the official’s arrival, and the lateral escape plus off-page transmission to the archivist. Causality is coherent under a largely situational/accumulative lens, and the closure (remaining a witness while defying control via the pigeon message) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. All set-ups (quarantine, charts, lateral method, archivist) pay off without stray threads. The only limit is that external consequences remain mostly implied, slightly softening the punch of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: arrival → request for special lantern → UV revelation on the vial → flower’s opening and emotional shift, all causally linked. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the vial becomes “compass, not trap,” and his relationship to memory and work is clearly altered with visible cost (tears, reorientation of vocation). The single-scene flow is clean, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. Every major setup (ultraviolet beam, extinct plants, empty vial) pays off in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: roadside arrival → grotto descent → visionary tours → mirror chamber → re-emergence to the road, with clear before/after in his relationship to his past. Causality is soft but legible under the lyric lens; each step follows from his stated goal and the being’s responses, and the rope functions as a throughline constraint. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he renounces self-mythologizing and chooses to carry, not cut, his history, with cost visible in the need to forgive “the version of me that ran first and helped later.” The main ceiling is that external circumstances never truly squeeze his options; structural turns are more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → circle forming → music and bowl gathering → stories → decision to visit “halves and almosts,” culminating in the reweighted hush and map image. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens: playing and listening lead to the hush loosening and the community’s new commitment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after around how they relate to silence and broken things. The only restraint is that external stakes remain low-key and there’s no sharp mid-story tightening; pressure deepens by pattern rather than a pronounced turn.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative single-scene structure is clean: Rhea arrives with a problem, undergoes a guided counterfeit experience, and leaves with altered options and a charged object. Causality is subtle but present—conversation and scent ritual lead to an internal realignment, with clear before/after in how she will relate to her work (“the herd will taste you arriving”). Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on the page with conceptual cost: she will risk more emotional exposure in her science; the narrator risks attachment. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, though the transformation remains quiet enough that the cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain from misaddressed envelope → investigation of the locket → Harbor Ledger → public recognition is coherent and accumulative, with the symphony-night event functioning as a structural climax. The piece uses a mosaic/lyric progression but teaches its pattern early and pays it off in the closing key-and-bookmark exchange, which reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration: stewardship and listening become shared. Cost is legible in Mara relinquishing sole custodianship and inviting riskier public acknowledgment. Some intermediate beats (e.g., town response) are summarized rather than pressured in scene, but the global drive remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is controlled: arrival → legend of the tag → communal search → discovery of the curve-as-posture → decision to build an echoing arbor → communal leaning and completion. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator is not “healed” but grafted, and the cost—carrying a glowing ache and accepting the obligation to tend the arbor—is legible on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal links) holds cleanly, and each phase of the search builds toward the final communal posture and construction. No key setups are dropped, and the last image reweights the whole story without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ascent to the canals → locating the interrupted cadence → opening the temporal oval → encounter with larvae → uncaging one and repaying the debt. Causality is clear under the textural lens: each use of the pendant and each breath of the giant incrementally deepen the situation until the bells and the closing of the oval reconfigure options with visible cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the narrator has changed the city’s soundscape and incurred a debt, yet accepts only a modest, ethically tuned intervention and returns to observation. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early and never feels muddy despite the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: he arrives with tools, engages in an increasingly charged ritual, reaches a theorem/insight, then departs altered. Causality is subtle but coherent—each object introduced (stone, eyes, rope of light, stalactite) feeds the next micro-choice, and the closure (carrying an unsolved theorem rather than spectacle) reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the drive lens (textural/accumulative) stays stable. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the middle lacks a sharper pivot or complication—tension deepens, but with very even cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: outage → tape activation → sensing the girl’s need → cache vision → reveal of notebook → quiet return to the walls. Causality is coherent and rooted in the story’s rules (tape + metal + outage = readable memory) without over-explaining. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his worldview about visibility and service crystallizes in the final tracing of the arrow and closing of the panel. No orientation debt; the lyricism never obscures who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: storm season and the river crossing set pressure, mid-story she’s forced to reconsider her tactics as storms untie her arrangements, and closure lands when she reframes her role publicly and privately. Causality is soft but consistent—weather, town need, and plant responses all push her toward releasing control. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her vow at the trellis and the “daily practice of attention” clearly mark a before/after with conceptual cost. The primary limitation is the relative gentleness of external stakes; nothing challenges her new stance in a way that might threaten backslide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: finding the brooch → keeper’s recognition and history → journey to the seam → pact → apparition → the negotiated exchange and its cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: they accept an ongoing pact with the island, reconfiguring memory, grief, and work. The cost is legible in the required surrender of the gnat and the commitment to keep painting/keeping the lamp as a form of ongoing service. Structure is cleanly contained in one continuous flow with no orientation debt and a decisive before/after in how both characters relate to the island and to memory.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative walk into the cave: arrival, deepening music, encounter with the pearl, then its choosing of the pilgrim and the ensuing reconfiguration. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens—the unseen forces and music consistently drive turns (the pearl rolling, the chord that empties the narrator of certainty). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the guide’s role is quietly upended and the cave’s purpose reframed toward everyday magic. The emotional and conceptual “before/after” are legible, though the explicit cost for the guide is implied more than stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows an accumulative, lyric structure where each action (receiving the valve, tapping the window, mapping the route) deepens the central task of teaching the harbor to “practice its return.” Orientation is clear early—who, where, when, and role are legible within the first few lines—and the pattern it teaches (listening to absences, converting them into structure) holds consistently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: by the end, “absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated,” and the harbor carries their “small work” forward. Stakes remain quiet and conceptual, but the before/after in stance and practice is distinct and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clear: maps and arrows → depot and train → platform of memories → fortress and corridor, each step causally and thematically linked. Closure is strong: the protagonist’s stance toward patterns and truth-telling is reconfigured on the page with a legible before/after. The drive lens (primarily accumulative/textural with clean causal steps) holds from midpoint through the ending. Stakes remain internal, but the narrative never loses orientation in time, place, or goal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival with a mandate, pattern-gathering, Lio’s visit as inflection, the ritual with the tile, and the emergence of the “room” all build coherently. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds: repeated images (tile, whales, journals, patterns) intensify into a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator’s stance toward the tower’s “magic” shifts. Closure lands on-page with cost as the narrator risks their own unclean grief in the shared room and then commits to keeping the door open for the town. There are no real causality gaps, though the “method” of the room’s appearance is more metaphorical than dramatized mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: preparation with the amulet and storm, Lio’s arrival, the corridor experience, then the reconfigured exit. Causality within the conceit holds: solar storm → honest doors → charged amulet → corridor of farewells → thematic revaluation of goodbye. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: goodbye becomes infrastructure and blueprint, with costs dramatized in the memories and unforgiveness paid to the corridor. The beat sequence is legible and satisfying, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, holding this just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the prep-room job enables the ruse; the known alarm reset and director’s habits create the breach; their plan unfolds stepwise into Arman’s escape and the acquisition of incriminating account numbers. Stakes and options are legible throughout, and each beat (“He leaves the bolt hanging”; “the reset chime dings”) narrows their window plausibly. Closure lands both in Arman’s successful transfer to the van and the narrator’s new leverage for asylum, with clear conceptual cost for the corrupt officials. The drive feels primarily causal with a strong lyric overlay, and that lens holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early (lamp hum, bonsai, light, invented histories) and sustains it cleanly, with no orientation or lens confusion. Causality is gentle but coherent: town’s silence → narrator’s methods → stories traveling back → evolving conditions (frozen basin, weakening hum) reframing the work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the anticipated duet between town lamps and the mountaintop lamp recasts all prior pages as preparation, with the cost being his long, solitary vigil. Stakes and the before/after are clear even without a discrete “twist.”

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: wandering/collecting → overheard hint → poison label → mechanic confirmation → confrontation with widow → return to walking, with a charged choice left on the widow’s side. Causality holds and the drive lens (textural/accumulative with causal strands) stays stable; the docks and bureaucracy pattern pay off conceptually at the end. Closure functions as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: leaving the label on the crate reweights the whole story’s attention to records, memory, and fear. The only limiter is that external consequences remain off-page, so the decisive change is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through repeated humming, retelling, and the compass’ reactions until the “page that never closes” appears and the riddle is reframed. Orientation is clean from the outset (myth buster, abandoned observatory, night ritual) and the pattern of magical-lyric causality is taught early and maintained. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the riddle’s answer (“never about certainty… but about kindness carried forward”) reweights all prior efforts and gives a before/after in his relationship to truth. The cost—relinquishing certainty as the goal—is present but somewhat soft and could be made more legible in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: consultants → fences → covert graffiti system → liaison’s demand → Nessa’s bargain → raft realignment → seasonal reprieve. The story closes on a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: they’ve altered how power flows, bought time, and reframed allegiance, with the cost (“only a season”) plainly on the page. The console’s responsiveness to the chip is a slight convenience but is seeded earlier via childhood theft and the anchor-slab lore, so it doesn’t undercut closure. Structure is linear-lyric but coherent, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: arrival → setup of chemical timers → staged countdown → emergence of the moth → shutter and farewell, all under a single ticking dawn. Causality is clean and rooted in constraints (electronics fail, so chemical messages structure time), and the vials provide concrete beats of escalation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of taking the photograph and witnessing the moth’s ascent reprice “keeping watch” and what preservation can and cannot do. The cost—the extinction that cannot be averted, only accompanied—is undeniable in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: repair → launch of trial → first successful coupling → second, more perilous attempt in deepening fog → resolution. Stakes and sequence are always legible despite the dense imagery, and the escalation from first to second car is well timed. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the depot’s “exhale” and “smile” mark a before/after in tension and confirm the system’s success at felt risk. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/technical rather than dramatized as a near-failure with lasting consequence, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: from interior pattern-reading to exterior pursuit, to under-hill convergence, to contemplative return, each stage grows logically from the last. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural with causal steps, and closure lands in the quiet reconfiguration of how the narrator will map (“until the atlas breathed differently”), with a legible conceptual cost. No orientation issues: who/where/when and the core task are anchored very early. The only limiter is that the central turn (discovering/initiating convergence) remains gently scaled, more spiritual than decisively reconfiguring concrete options beyond the narrator’s interior and their maps.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the tuner arrives, tests the town, engages a family, gathers neighbors, then tunes the central bell, leading to a communal practice that clearly marks a before/after. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—walking and listening gradually reconfigure the town’s stance—and the closure (the town answering with feet) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, opposition is mostly historical and atmospheric; present-tense resistance is light, so turns lack sharp constraint or loss. Still, the piece holds a single throughline without orientation issues or structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is cleanly causal: crippled sub → search for mythic temple → navigate dangerous corridor → set transmitter + vial → send signal → feel line answer → return along the line. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the signal has gone out at cost (time, risk, stillness under panic), and the narrator chooses to leave the temple, hauling the lifeline back, with rescue not yet guaranteed but options reweighted. The environment (fissure, narrowing corridor, surge, dwindling air) constrains tactics at each step, and no set-up (temple acoustics, vial’s properties, line) is left unkept. Cost is legible in the late emphasis on gauges, bodily strain, and the decision to turn back while trusting the unseen answer.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece reads under an accumulative/textural drive with a clear throughline from arrival at the lighthouse to the charged poise of waiting for the boat, having placed the lattice over the drain. Causality holds: his heritage-board pretext enables free movement, the lattice use deepens (tube → lantern room → drain), and the discovery of the almost-bodies tightens the “before they find the bodies” clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he commits to a specific mode of testimony, neither silence nor alarmism, with the cost of relinquishing his father’s simpler lie/truth binary. The only structural softness is that the external stakes (exact nature of the crime) remain deliberately oblique, which slightly blunts impact but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative/lyric, but the pattern of episodic “cameo” lessons is taught early and held, leading cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration at the end (orchard now wakes and remembers him). Causality is soft but legible: bead → awakenings → training → repayment of debt → her departure → his charged new status as keeper who remembers and is remembered. Closure carries a clear cost: the completion of the debt necessitates her vanishing, even as it secures the orchard’s loyalty. The only limitation is that the initiating problem (stolen heart key) and its resolution remain metaphorically framed rather than concretely tested in a single, high-pressure on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: leave wharf → follow dreamwalk routes into labyrinth → confront precedent at altar → return with changed harbor and communal stance. Causal links are clear (sleepwalking paths to stairs, plate to opening chambers, sewing names to nets’ response, altar ritual to sluices opening and harbor revival), and the accumulative beats build naturally. Closure lands as both a decisive change (the harbor’s channels reopen, the town’s practice shifts) and a resonant reconfiguration of how they relate to the labyrinth and sea, with the cost of relinquishing the plate and risking herself. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is very controlled: excavation → discovery of the sundial base → rebuilding the gnomon → reorientation of time and faith → decision not to leave forms a clear throughline. Causality under a textural lens holds: each action (reading the stele, aligning noon, tending the trees) materially reweights her stance toward home and the dead. Closure lands solidly with her staying on as caretaker and the orchard recast as “library,” a resonant reconfiguration with a real implied cost (abandoning the prior expatriate life). There are no orientation or lens-clarity slips, and nothing crucial is resolved off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: retrieve the chalk message, decode the map of names, select “Auricle,” then confront the act of mailing as a charged threshold. Causality holds under a textural lens—each step naturally follows the last, with no orientation issues or rule-breaking, and the flash of remembered apprenticeship ties back into the present action. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the letter is poised above the slot, the narrator’s past and present reconfigured by the chalk, with a visible choice about when (and how) to let meaning go. The cost is subtle (risk, responsibility, relinquishing control) but legible, not merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arriving, beginning to stitch, the cloth opening to whisper, revelation of falsified charts and coup rehearsals, then the charged quiet of blame and departure. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame (stitching → cloth-throat → whisper → ash names → blame prophecy), and the final image of the candle at the window functions as a Charged Poise with clear conceptual cost. The dominant drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds from mid-story through closure without confusion. The only limitation is that the coup and its stakes remain offstage, so the decisive change is more about deepened knowledge and assumed future blame than an on-page shift in options.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival in the mangroves → invocation of spirits via shard and condensation → re-encounter of the cathedral moment → articulated realization and new stance. Causality is textured but clear under the chosen lens: the shard and spirits enable access to the past hinge, the written message reframes the core misstep, and the spoken address to Mara leads to a different decision about how to return. Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—the choice to “not decide” but to hold the hinge together—with a visible emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is handled early and confidently despite the lyric mode, with no breaks in temporal or spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story is structurally clean: one continuous waiting-room arc with a clear before/after defined by the boy’s unconscious state and the family’s estrangement softening. Causality is accumulative but coherent—decoding the cast leads to the constructed “script,” which leads to the small rapprochement, then to the coral’s placement and the quiet closure. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: they move from guarded hostility to shared language and touch, with emotional cost visible in their hesitations. Stakes and timeline are clear throughout; no orientation debt or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: enter the foggy district, attempt to read the damaged film, enlist the knowledge network, and arrive at the communal wreath-display and resolved plan. Causality is coherent—the damage to the film prompts the turn to the network, which shapes the revised festival and the looped ending image—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the outset. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with altered understanding of joy as communal and ongoing, with the “plan to paint the gaps tomorrow” articulating an earned after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: dawn entry → experimental restoration via sound → layered revelations in the mural → explicit admission of fear → dusk exit with a reweighted stance. Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens; each new layer (mason’s daughter, dancing pair, patron’s feast, then self-revelation) arises from her chosen method and questioning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with “a lighter step,” having accepted uncertainty as an ongoing cost and condition, with the mural now an active interlocutor. Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic, but the before/after is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: world premise → dismissal/club → covert garden language → audit pressure → greenhouse crackdown → public “rattle choir” loophole as resolution. Each step plausibly grows from the prior, and the legal clause twist (“Artistic rehearsal… renders thought tax-exempt”) retrofits earlier “rehearsal” imagery cleanly. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the law is turned against itself, and the world’s rules are conceptually repriced via the officers’ inadvertent participation. The only limitation is that consequences remain relatively bloodless—no visible retaliation or sacrifice on the page—which slightly mutes felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: postcard → repeated lullaby-messages → Gardener’s arrival → breath-signed treaty → transformed shell with visitors, all under one drive to change her relationship to pain and sleeplessness. Closure lands as an earned stasis/resonant reconfiguration: she remains insomniac but now rises “gentler,” actively tending an armistice instead of enduring solitary vigilance. Causality is soft but coherent at a lyric level; the lullabies leading to the Gardener’s arrival and the vow leading to the shell’s transformation feel internally motivated. The cost—continuing wakefulness and ongoing tending work rather than transcendence—is legible if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: morning routine → intrusion of the wind’s warning → retrieval and repair of the chime → balcony offering → private coda and self-test. Causality within this lyric frame is solid and legible, and the world’s rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reaffirms her role through the repaired chime and then risks her own name to check whether forgetting has begun, with a felt cost in that small act of fear. There’s no orientation debt; the strange setting is taught quickly and used coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: arrive with an aim (restore trust), compose the interconnected promises, trigger Lio’s return, and reach a joint revision that reconfigures their dynamic. The salt ravine flashback is well-anchored and directly informs present stakes, clarifying why this particular apology form matters. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they accept ongoing risk while altering how they’ll handle truth and doubt, with the archive’s “breath” and the open door image marking a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with consistent causal links, and cost (emotional exposure, renounced silence-as-safety) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: summoned by the council → evidence of tampering via the envelope → deduction of the lovers → discovery of the hidden sluice → retuning the floodgates and negotiating a new equilibrium. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gates’ behavior and civic record-keeping are permanently altered, and a social norm (“open mercy destroys careers faster than lava”) is reweighted via encrypted compassion. Cost is present but subtle—political risk, suppressed naming, ongoing vigilance rather than rupture—suited to the lyric mode. Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation debt, though the pressure arc remains more graceful than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is controlled: the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and tightens around the attic’s impending clearance and the decision to trust the violinist. Causal through-line—old betrayal → meticulous control (dust mapping, scales) → external pressure (attic cleared, skylight unlatching) → choice to send the choir and stitch the chip to Lark—is coherent and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “a hinge loosen[s] where suspicion had rusted it shut,” with palpable cost and no reset. Time and place are clear from the start; reflection and present action are well interleaved.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: terrace → bench grain → weather codes → seam → vision of mazes → choice to keep distance. Causality within the lyric logic holds, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early despite the surreal frame. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: thresholds redefined as sacred intervals, with the cost of not reuniting made tangible. There are no dangling set-ups or confusing jumps within this compact frame.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight and legible: arrival under a deadline, unlocking the city via the sentinel algorithm, accessing the memory engine, then resting and departing transformed. Causality is clean (feather → sentinel → murals → heart lab → archive → redefinition of “luminous respite”), and the sunrise clock bookends the piece without confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s mapping craft is reweighted from control/destination toward reciprocity and listening, with a clear before/after. The only thing holding it below 9 is that the risk of failure under the sunrise/riptide constraint never quite sharpens into a concrete on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: hired for a vanishing path → delve into geode with crater glass → enlist bird/seeds → discover subterranean beast → reroute path and carry explanation home. Structure is linear, legible, and the closure is a conceptual repricing (paths as caretakers) backed by concrete action (new path, letter to elders). The deadline (“before memory fades”) and “polite ghosts” never truly tighten tactics, so temporal stakes feel underused. Still, the accumulative lyric structure holds its lens and lands with a clear before/after understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build from observational setup to a charged, intimate exchange and a conceptual reframing of the performer’s craft. Causality is soft but coherent: the narrator’s deliberate “ordering randomness” leads to the girl’s star, the janitor’s memory, and the bishop’s near-transfer, culminating in the “rehearsal for luck” closure. The final beats—janitor almost keeping then returning the bishop, the comet drawing, and the narrator resuming the act—constitute a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional and conceptual cost. Orientation is solid from early on, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural with situational undertones) holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/lyric structure holds cleanly: past exile → clandestine garden scene → projected future, all oriented around the act of inscribing the verse. Causality is soft but coherent—nostalgia ban → exile → illicit verse → decision to carry it into the world—and the closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise where exile is reconfigured as calling. Cost is mainly conceptual (risk of patrols, debt to the sea) rather than tested in-scene, which mutes impact for a “prestige” market. Still, the before/after (drifter vs. vocation-bearing exile) is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric drive: present-moment ritual at the pond, conceptual planning, and a forward look to the meeting in the shed all add up to a clear stance on how to build. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “we were its light first” reweights the entire commission and the town’s relationship to spectacle and value. Causality is soft but coherent—the pond ritual leads directly to specific design decisions (reuse ferry boards, etch tide maps) and to what he will argue later. Cost is implied rather than dramatized (loss of ferry, gentrification), but the before/after in his outlook is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is tight: walk → wait/reflection → meeting → joint ritual → future-oriented plan, all causally linked to the original fire and the found box. The dominant drive is Situational/Accumulative: the meeting forces a stance on guilt and remembrance, and the closure beat (planning to work with children, him leaving with an “empty box”) is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is precise from the outset. No setups are dropped; every major early element (box, bargain, translation) pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: each pattern, balloon, and gauge response layers until the needle finds a new, stable “angle” and the narrator exits with a reweighted sense of what hope can be. Causality is coherent at the lyrical level (ritual → multi-self congress → new choreography for hope → plan to teach the village). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act, and the before/after is legible. The only limitation is the relative softness of on-page price—nothing is lost or threatened besides prior despair, which keeps the structural stakes more meditative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: discoveries progress from diaries → negative → hopscotch child → unsent letter → vow, each deepening the core question of how to bear the house’s legacy. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the lyric drift never muddies where we are. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator accepts the promise and leaves a charged map behind while the house “rose slightly on its stilts of memory,” with the cost of ongoing responsibility and self-effacement on the page. Nothing important feels unkept or arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: terrace → descent to atelier → mirror lesson → reconfigured way of seeing, all driven by the initial visit. Causality is clear under a lyric lens (desire leads to seeking the painter; exercises with mirrors lead to altered reflections and stance). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator moves from begging for futures to “keep[ing] the tunes folded into my breath” and walking toward “the kind of day that could keep us,” with the cost of continued vulnerability intact. A very slight softness is that the risk of failure in the lesson is more implied than dramatized in a specific on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: offerings → argument over redemption → naming of the dead → children’s desires → revised clauses → closing ritual with the casings bowl. The global drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the war’s grip is explicitly loosened, and the annual terrace ritual and bowl fix a new pattern with clear ongoing cost. Causality is coherent—each move grows from the prior one in a “therefore/so” chain even within the lyric frame. The only slight limit is that the on-page stakes remain at the level of provisional agreements rather than a crisply dramatized turning point in a specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → preparation → ritual → exhalation of the egg → onset of thin rain, all causally linked by his project of drought and resonance. Orientation never wavers—we always know where we are, what he’s doing, and why—and the pattern of engineered absence → ritualized echo is taught early and paid off in the chamber’s activation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the egg empties, he feels release, and manufactured rain begins in a world he’s wounded, with visible conceptual and emotional cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal spine) remains consistent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: courtyard ritual → prism harvest → bowl/looms in tunnels → rewiring the lullaby → city voices shift. The accumulative structure is coherent and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s “inhaled differently,” a clear before/after conceptual change with social cost implied. The palace threat and “between sigh and smile” window create a live clock, though the danger never quite bites on the page—no consequence beyond near-miss. Structure is tight for the length, but a more tangible price for success would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: argument → solitary reflection in the dome → decision to change method → arrival of the woman → joint redesign → first performance under new rules. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the troupe’s practice is materially altered. Some middle moves (designing and staging the new show) are summarized rather than dramatized, but the chain is legible and emotionally continuous. Cost is conceptual but real: renouncing exploitative tactics and accepting followership in place of leadership.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb to grotto → ritual constructions → arrival of the last monarch → hawk shadow interruption → protective placement of the wing → charged stillness at the end. Orientation is solid from the first line; the drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural with motifs of cadence, signal, and witness intensifying rather than conventional plot turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s method and stake are reweighted when the monarch “bless[es] the method” and the narrator chooses stillness as active witness, with conceptual cost tied to ephemerality and loss. The only limit is that the “price” of this stance stays mostly conceptual; there’s no strongly dramatized before/after rupture in options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: prepare furnace and rope, channel aurora and card into wax, pour bronze, then test the bells. Causality is clear under a textural lens and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration—staying to listen with the sense that a specific emotional task has been completed. The stakes and price (exhaustion, ongoing commitment to listening and craft as penance) are legible but remain understated. A slightly sharper hinge where the ritual might fail or the promise to “return only after forgiving yourself” is explicitly tested would raise the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is accumulative but coherent: storm pressure rises, the seal is opened, the archive processes dreams, a map appears, the corridor and door culminate in the decisive step. Each move causally follows from the last within the story’s surreal logic, and the closure—accepting the path and leaving the bunker—lands clearly with a before/after. The “decaying directive” frame and the storm both function as continuous through-lines rather than ornament. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of safety and role, even if external consequences are left offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain from finding the magic square tile to discovering the alcove, opening the urn, and making the covenant is clean and legible. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with deepening discoveries; each act (copying schematics, aligning wires, pouring water, pulling the thread) meaningfully advances the situation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts stewardship rather than seeking power, with the before/after reweighted around maintenance as covenant. Stakes remain quiet but coherent, and the price (lifetime attention, anonymity, material sacrifice) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: Rell arrives, is guided to the box, is pulled through a memory-factory, and exits altered, with the sanctuary frame holding everything together. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid—touching the box and the narrator’s physical guidance trigger the deepening into childhood and factory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Rell leaves with the box and a reweighted relation to resentment, with the cost of carrying a new kind of responsibility. The only small limitation is that the sanctuary’s selection of Rell and its “ledger” remain more atmospheric than structurally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive with a goal, build the mirror corridor, endure a wobble as Noor falters, then land on a reconfigured way of “holding” the dream. Causality is clear at each step—broken sextant → reconstructed optics → corridor → dream’s reaction—and the closure beat (teaching holding instead of trapping, orchard/city reconnected) is on the page with a legible before/after. Stakes and method are both seeded early (“would not chase; they would recreate…”), so the ending feels earned. Cost is mostly emotional and conceptual rather than materially dramatized, but it is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival in the failed cathedral-order, diagnosis of the problem (vows that stopped shedding), improvised ritual, and a reconfigured status quo at the end. Causality is clear—restarting the shedding via bell and ribbon repairs both orchard and symbolic order—and the breach of contract frames but doesn’t overcomplicate things. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard now breathes, the father chooses to wait, and the “contract” is repriced as gift. The main limitation is that very little genuinely threatens derailment, so the arc, while elegant, feels gently inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: bathroom epiphany → mirror vision of aunt → forbidden grove → new rule (“ask with your lineage”) → cameo activation → fruit choice → revelation → reframed vocation. Causality is intact and legible within the lyric mode, with each step arising from the last, and the closure beat functions as a conceptual repricing of “inheritance” and “curation” with a real implied cost to identity. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early despite the strangeness, and the ledger/between-pages motif pays off nicely at the aunt-in-the-membrane moment. Stakes remain largely abstract and philosophical rather than dramatized as a sharp dilemma, which slightly mutes the sense of risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: traveler arrival → diary as guide → rescue of apprentice → ascent to the library → conceptual repricing of “rescue” at the end. Causality is soft but legible—the diary, skipped entries, and gaps concretely drive each turn—and the pattern of following omissions is taught and then paid off. Closure is strong on a conceptual level (the library opens through kind failure, and the mission shifts from objects/people to “gentler futures” for themselves), though the cost remains more implied than dramatized. Under a textural drive lens, the piece lands a resonant reconfiguration, but a sharper sense of what might be lost or risked in entering the library would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is controlled: the ship, card, funhouse, jar, and garden beats build one continuous drive toward the garden and the identity choice. “As memories alter” teaches the reader how time and space behave, and the ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration as the narrator relinquishes the ledger-self and adopts the card-as-compass. Causality is poetic rather than literal but coherent within its rules; each move grows out of the prior image or decision. The cost—losing the chimera-twin discoverer identity while gaining a new, uncertain self—is legible in the final planting and the card over the heart.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causality is clean: strange seal → theory about absence-bred doors → experimental knotwork → revealed ledger → merge and re-integration into the archive. The story maintains one coherent line of pressure (repairing a historical/ontological gap) and lands an on-page decisive change when the ledger is restored and the door seals. The cost is mostly conceptual (lost scholarships and research; his brief risk in stepping through), which suits the piece but keeps the stakes cerebral rather than gripping. Structure is elegant and linear, but the resolution feels almost too smooth, with little sense that failure was a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: energy beings destabilize the caves → the mapkeeper studies the new “weather” via ice → finds the right corridor → plants the bloom of hush → cohabitation rule is redefined. Causality is coherent within a lyric mode, with each step arising from the previous discovery or choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the beings’ permanence and learned quiet conceptually reprice the initial threat, and the map now “holds their hinge.” Cost is mostly conceptual (living with ongoing storms, tending the hush) rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: custodian with a broken beacon and a theory about coincidences → arrival of Lio with star map → discovery of missing constellation within the hush shard → repair and rekindling of the beacon → community response and reconfiguration of meaning. The drive lens feels Hybrid leaning causal: worldbuilding is accumulative/lyric, but the key turns hinge on specific decisions to test and deploy the shard and the star paths. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (beacon rekindled, people arrive) plus a Conceptual Repricing of coincidence, with a legible “before/after” in isolation vs. connection. The main structural weakness is that the central solution arrives via a dream-called traveler and matching map, making coincidence itself the solver rather than something the protagonist wrestles against, which slightly softens the perceived cost and inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear and cohesive: observatory duties → growing anxiety about self-erasure → lightning’s reassurance → concrete act of sharing a personal memory → reconfigured stance. Causality is lyric rather than linear but holds under the textural drive lens, and the closure beat (archiving her own moment alongside others) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/what the work is) is swiftly established despite the strangeness, and the world rules (shadows, forecourt, quill) remain consistent. The one constraint is that the midsection slightly plateaus in pressure, relying on tonal continuity more than a sharpened turn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival → discovery of tools and Lark → preparation → ignition → aftermath. Causality is sound (mosaic note → secret cubby → tools → designed sequence → show that shifts the fortress mood), and the drive lens (textural escalation toward a ritual of light) holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “gravity loosen[ing]” and the pact to keep counting possibilities, with the ash feeding blooms as a concrete before/after marker. Cost is present conceptually (they work within gravity, not vanquish it) but remains gentle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a single extended pause that accumulates pressure until it crystallizes in the explicit answer “Yes, I will go inland,” which functions as a clear Decisive Change. The accumulative lens is impeccably held: each reflection (possible futures, mentor, cicada, tide) reweights the same central decision rather than wandering. Closure lands with cost on the page—the before/after of staying vs. going, and the sense of foreclosed coastal life, are starkly legible. The only minor limit is that external consequences remain mostly projected rather than briefly sampled in concrete post-choice stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: visit trellis → harvest silences → capture gilded hush → bring it to father → plans physically and conceptually soften. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each silence sampling builds toward the specific gilded hush that can bridge worlds, and the final act of sharing reconfigures the core rule (what “safe” can mean). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: father’s practice and their shared idea of home are altered on the page, with visible cost (risking his bunker doctrine, her attachment to exits). No orientation or lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ride, anchored early in role and place, with the train-whistle hush as a framing device that returns at closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each pass through different sound zones (seam of night, baffles, library hum) and each revelation (the singer’s death, the grief equation) deepens the central pressure rather than diverting it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the same hush that begins the piece becomes, by the final echo, a space that can “hold her without hands,” with the clear storm glass and altered terrace as supporting evidence. The cost—living with grief and guilt rather than solving or erasing it—is implied but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mission → rumor → waterfall → murals → hatch → inverted stair → throne → governance choice, with no orientation or logic breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the throne remains unbound, power becomes a duet and a stewardship rather than a singular sovereign, and the city’s status shifts in conceptually legible ways. The sunrise deadline sets a situational frame but exerts little concrete pressure on tactics, so cost reads more conceptual than bodily or logistical. Even so, the before/after in how governance and possibility are structured is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/situational structure is clear: arrival at the sanctuary → ritual with the door/knocker → instruction of the first student → her autonomous crossing. Causality is metaphoric but coherent (scars as channel, names as smoke-shapes, breathing practice stabilizing the threshold), and the closure—student returning breathing and crossing unescorted—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is quickly legible within the chosen lyric mode and remains stable. A slight abstraction of concrete stakes (what happens if the lesson fails) keeps it just shy of top-tier tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is strong: gauges flirt with red → glitch texts arrive → protagonist consults and chooses among selves’ advice → reorients chamber, uses bolt, and signs the console, leading to the diamond harvest. The hybrid lens (causal with accumulative lyric pressure) holds consistently through to closure. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change with conceptual repricing: the vow is kept at personal cost, and the ledger of debt is literally and metaphorically rewritten. A touch more on-page fear of failure or concrete consequence for ignoring the texts could sharpen perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: enter the room → activate the device → decipher the ash-confession → reinterpret the dynasty’s fall → commit to a new social order. Causality is firm within the lyric mode; each step grows naturally from the last, and the closure unit—a conceptual repricing of “ending the dynasty” into an act of mercy and re-foundation—lands clearly with cost. Orientation is swift and stable (who, where, when, and why are all anchored in the opening lines), and the accumulative/textural drive lens holds through to the final image. The only ceiling here is that complications are relatively frictionless; no serious structural tensions threaten to derail or fragment the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative ritual: arrival → guided movement via the program → vision of possible futures → forced choice at the kernel, all under a single, coherent lens. Causality is poetic but legible (the program’s directions and the orchard’s patterns lead him to the kernel; touching it triggers visions; to “capture possibility” he must choose and ingest one). Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: he renounces the old vow and binds himself to tending mornings, with the cost of all other possibilities left behind implied on the page. The only limitation is that the consequences of choosing one possibility remain abstract rather than dramatized in a concrete, altered circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is very tight: dust → strange box → button → file contents → counselor’s prints → revised note and envelope, each “therefore” deepening the central question of what can be known or saved. Orientation is clear from the opening and the story holds a consistent file-room-present frame, with backstory anchored to concrete artifacts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “unknown” reweights from cavern to corridor, with the cost (accepting partial, fragile acts in the face of systemic erasure) plain on the page. The entire investigation sequence is necessary to earn that final stance; no major setup is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine from museum announcement → memory of mother → key → lagoon “hack” is clean and legible under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: once the program opens a line between lagoon and museum, the world’s supposed “end of the story” is reweighted and we feel the cost in implied danger and ongoing resistance. The structure is tight for this length—one progression with no sprawl—and the final charged poise (the line holding, minor corrections starting tomorrow) gives a clear before/after. The only ceiling is that the practical consequences and risks remain largely implied rather than faced in a concrete on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene, causally coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each wave of condensation-prophecy prompting a tactical musical response. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the rules of the world—fog holds notes; condensation writes prophecy—are stable. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: the ring of absence on the glass and the intact oath mark a legible before/after, with future-cost implied if the ritual ever fails. The only limitation is that the cost remains conceptual and projected rather than concretely enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the hush arrives, the ritual unfolds, a phrase is deciphered, and a new method is adopted, all within one coherent scene. Causality is clear under a textural lens: hush → leaf-fall → phrase → instruction → new monuments → conceptual repricing. Closure lands in the recognition that the real transformation is in the listener and that her role is to “keep ears growing,” which reweights everything before it. Stakes and costs are mostly conceptual and gentle rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal: fire → discovery of compass → descent → encounter with admiral’s legacy → acceptance of a new practice, with no orientation issues. The underground waterfall room and journal provide a clear hinge that reconfigures the protagonist’s understanding and options. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the tinkerer adopts a new relationship to planning and time, with visible implications for how they’ll work. Stakes remain primarily internal and could be sharpened with more concrete external cost, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is tight: search party fails → coin and cup become instruments → repeated weighings reveal the rule about names → furnace ritual and alloy forge the closure. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds cleanly, with each ritual step deepening the rules and the emotional cost rather than wandering. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist accepts that Mara won’t return but establishes a new balance-symbol that settles the “debt” with the stone at personal cost. There are no causality breaks, and the before/after is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene: arrival → listening via harp → rising density of voices → focused encounter with the laughing woman → river’s story → her departure and his move on. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent (plucking strings invites confessions; touching the tooth wakes the river; the woman’s laughter and the river’s memory braid into her crossing). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he cannot follow her into the clearing and instead turns toward the next valley, accepting perpetual incompletion as his path. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, with one clear tightening around the woman’s fear and its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is very controlled: we move from waking and disorientation, through calibration in the forest, to the formulation of a rule and a mission toward the valley. Causality under a textural lens is clear—each sensory or reflective beat deepens the ethical problem and leads logically to the creation of a boundary and the choice to confront “the ones still turning screws.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: torture practice is reweighted by a new metric of mercy that has visible cost. No orientation debt or lens slippage undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the market → engagement with the painting → ritual use of the lens → retrieval and restoration of the child’s name, all in a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: once the name is spoken and tied to the frame, the world and the narrator’s “work” feel reweighted, and the cost is legible in the bodily sense of having “swallowed two worlds” and refusing a third. Causality is poetic but coherent—each step (“I set the lighthouse lens fragment before it…”, “I spoke those coordinates back…”, “I unfastened the linen…”) deepens the same line of action. The only slight limitation is that the global drive (what happens if the name is *not* recovered) remains implicit, which softens the sense of foreclosed alternative futures.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece is structurally tight: one continuous scene with clean orientation (elevator repairman, abandoned circus ticket office, ghosts) and a clear investigative through-line. Each beat follows causally: noticing the sagging tile leads to the barrel, which leads to the theft revelation, which forces the choice to unwind. Closure is strong and on-page: the fluorescent’s final failure, the ledger’s self-crossing entries, and the narrator’s departure all mark a before/after where a long-held debt is finally settled. Cost is legible in his acceptance of custodial responsibility for the barrel/story, satisfying a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight: discovery of the frost clause → decision whether to seal it → printing and suspended moment → reconfigured status quo. Causality is clean under a hybrid but strongly causal lens: each choice (opening the bottled whisper, aligning to the frost, pulling the lever) leads directly to the next state of the world. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual repricing: the law against perfection is formalized at a clear cost, and the library’s future options are redefined. The brief backstory is efficiently anchored and directly informs the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: discovery of the shard → invention of the mirror ritual → public storm-readings → council adjudication → coda of ongoing practice and the shard’s cracking. Each phase clearly grows from the last, and the council scene reconfigures the stakes on the page with a visible before/after (the archive vote, Ledger’s muffled laughter). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the civilization’s meaning and the function of ornament are revised at a social level. The only slight limitation is that the council’s decision is briskly summarized rather than more fully dramatized in beat-by-beat interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: city’s dimming → chamber negotiation → demanded collateral → shadow sacrifice → light’s conditional return, with no rule-breaking late reveals. This is essentially a single continuous ritual scene whose pressure tightens toward the demand for the shadow and the embedding of conditional listening into the world. Closure is on-page and costly (shadow lost, lifelong service promised), with a clear before/after state for the city. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is how smoothly the covenant yields once terms are proposed—there’s little genuine doubt that the bargain will succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: exploration → psychic glimpses → personal revelation → subdued reconfiguration, and that pattern is consistent. Causality is tight at this scale: factory shuts → lagoon returns → psychometry reveals the past party → father connection → scarf/lesson, with no unkept setups. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she emerges “hinged awake,” carrying grief and courage rather than solved mystery. Stakes are primarily interior, but the cost—accepting an unanswerable loss—reads clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: GPS fails → skiff beached → lantern used → images guide construction → gate completed → passage and vow, forming a coherent before/after in how she understands “passage.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: journeys become “scaffolds we become,” and the vow to keep building such gates feels like a decisive internal reorientation. Causality is poetic rather than mechanical but consistently motivated by prior cues (cartographer’s teachings, the storm, the archway). The cost is mostly conceptual (abandoning simple, tool-based navigation for a more demanding, relational one), which is effective but could be made slightly sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: cathedral window → postcards → scent experiment → seasonal mural work → pavilion exhibition and final postcard. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: each choice logically extends the quest to understand night-blooming, and the grandmother’s last card reconfigures everything without feeling like a cheat. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “night is the gentlest daylight we have” reframes the earlier hush and glass-work with a clear before/after in understanding. The cost remains primarily conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps this just below the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: letters → lagoon ritual → retrocognitive trap → parley and evidence → zeppelin’s departure toward public reckoning. Causality is clear within the lyric frame, and the closure—city “learning to read itself aloud,” with officials facing their own signatures—gives a decisive conceptual and situational reconfiguration. The cost of accessing and broadcasting the truth is legible in the trap and the emotional scald, and there are no orientation issues despite the surreal elements. It stops just short of 9+ only because the officials’ response and systemic consequence remain largely summarized offstage rather than pressured in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative progression from solitary return → planning → first ally → collective summons → communal action → reweighted final image. Causality is legible: her refusal of wishes leads to designing systems, which leads to invitations, which draws the sailor and then townsfolk, culminating in a new social contract. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bottle’s “ticking” and the declared end of wishes mark a before/after with a clear conceptual cost (no more easy miracles, only accountable labor). The drive lens stays consistently accumulative/textural, with each plan and object layering into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is controlled: the ritual with the basin, the memory shard, and the emergent prophecy all feed directly into the final decision. Causality is clear under the chosen mode: shaving the wax → voices → prophecy → dilemma → renunciation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change, with a legible before/after in the narrator’s practice and the orchard’s fate. The pattern is taught early enough that the field-trip detour feels integral rather than digressive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is extremely coherent: egg hatches → vortex manifests → naming and stabilizing → pedagogical journey through seasons → planting, with each movement reweighting the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: planting Return in the acorn cap transforms “inheritance” from custody into cyclical release, with the city’s tilt toward spring as on-page cost and consequence. Causality is mythic rather than mechanical but remains internally consistent under the textural lens. Nothing important is left dangling, and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/situational drive is very clean: zero hour approaches, pressure builds through instruments vs intuition, and resolves in a resonant reconfiguration when they choose bell over sirens and “switch posture.” Causality is coherent—microclimate readings, sounds (or their absence), and institutional demands all feed into the choice—and the corridor’s faltering after the bell underlines a conceptual but legible cost/repricing. Closure lands clearly with the recognition that the true switch is interpretive (verdict vs witness) and that this choice might carry professional risk. Orientation is never in doubt, and no set-up is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clear accumulative lyric, moving from routine cleaning to meteor burst and power failure to the boundary-revealing map and final stance. Causality is soft but coherent: his ongoing attention to the station leads to understanding the machines, then to responding meaningfully when the system fails, which in turn precipitates the map revelation and boundary choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reprices his purpose and the station’s “overlooked era,” accepting a charged stasis in “flourishing stillness…full of spared collision.” Stakes are modest and interior, but the before/after is legible and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is very controlled: daily ritual → covenant backstory → arrival of the queen-ghost → redefinition of the archive, with each layer tightening the central obligation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from passive witness to active custodian/kiln, paying with acknowledged guilt and ongoing burden. Causality is subtle but coherent (his past clauses → wasteland → covenant → queen’s demand), and the cost is legible in his acceptance of pain and responsibility. The only minor limit is that some earlier beats feel more textural than pressure-bearing, slightly softening the sense of inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the damaged capsule → coded garage sales → Lio’s arrival → opening and “walking” the letter → communal adoption of the new calendar. Causality holds under a textural lens: each step deepens the narrator’s engagement with non-numerical time rather than feeling like a collage of disconnected images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the protagonist accepts living by embodied, communal rhythms instead of seeking a return of numbers, with the cricket call and final garage-sale item sealing the “before/after.” The cost—relinquishing hope for old-time precision in favor of indeterminate “waiting”—is present but could be sharpened a touch more explicitly in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is elegant and coherent: calm observation → disruption with the snapped kite → ritualized response → quiet reconfiguration of the lagoon’s hush. Causality is soft but clear—every beat flows from the inciting break, and the closure (boy running to his mother “ribbonless yet tethered to a new listening”) provides a legible before/after. The drive lens is accumulative/textural; density of image and ritual builds rather than twisting plot, yet the emotional cost of loss is unmistakable. No major set-ups go unpaid, and the final return to cobalt and hush lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative/textural but coherent: orientation (caretaker, island, diagnosis, remodel plan) lands quickly, and each beat causally deepens the project (wiring, community arrival, otters, council, storm, fatigue, final consecration). Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the remodel is complete, trust established, and the caretaker’s death is framed as a return to the “woven map” they helped create. The living stone, copper, diary, otters, and rules all feed forward to that last chord and silence. The only thing keeping this below the very top tier is that the narrative pressure never tightens into a hard dilemma or narrow escape; the arc remains gently rising rather than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: arrival → guided ritual → basin ascent → window realization, all cohering under a textural/Conceptual Repricing lens. Closure is strong: the understanding that “home is a rate constant” and the act of leaving without new footprints reconfigure the premise with a felt, if quiet, cost (letting go of both easy awe and nostalgia). Causality is soft but consistent—each ritual step flows logically, with no dangling setups. The only limiter is that external stakes remain modest, keeping the arc more meditative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very coherent: one continuous dusk of seeding and translating builds toward a charged final crossing of the jetty. Causality is modest but sufficient for this mode—he listens to birds, chooses where to plant, removes bayonets, makes a trellis, and in so doing tightens the “submerged concord.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield is actively re-scripted as garden, and the treaty between drowned reef and shore becomes legible. Some readers seeking a more explicit decisive change or crisis beat might find the arc almost too even, but the pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: leaf → cylinders/riddle → decoding method → relay → contact with the sister → reconfigured understanding of distance. Orientation is clear early (the Sluice, post-war scrapyard) and the single throughline scene with embedded memories never becomes muddled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the call succeeds but doesn’t erase separation, instead reframing distance as something workable at a cost of waiting and vigilance. The price—continued drought, contingent future reunion, and fragile, time-bound contact—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene lyric accumulation: arrival on the deck → sketching attempt → temporal dislocation → reframed navigation practice → quiet closure. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens: each observation of the altered sky and time dilation forces a deeper reconsideration of how to navigate and what “true north” can mean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator forges a new axis of intention and dates the page by the blackout, conceptually reweighting the shutdown. Nothing essential is left dangling, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal beneath the lyric surface: arrival → opening the spire → progressive chess swaps → queen decision → repaired sky and new role. The closure is solid: the world’s dissonance is corrected and the protagonist’s vocation is reconfigured from thief to dedicated mender, with the sundial’s silence and travel promise as conceptual cost. Escalation through each swapped piece is coherent and legible, with no orientation issues despite the strangeness. Stakes stay mostly conceptual/ethical rather than dramatized in immediate jeopardy, which keeps this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is accumulative/textural and very controlled: we move from entering the gallery and proposing the method to enacting words, to the rumor of new orders, to the charged decision to leave artifacts and depart. Causality holds cleanly under this lens: the outlawed recordings necessitate echo-writing, which necessitates the feet-archive, which culminates in the narrator’s resolved plan to vanish with the “nomadic penumbra.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the before/after is clear in the shift from scripted victimhood to itinerant archivist, with the cost of self-erasure implied. The only minor limitation is that the regency pressure stays atmospheric rather than forcing a sharper on-page hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative progression from entrance into the mountain-bookstore to encounter with the seer, ordeal with feather and stone, and reconfiguration into the final door/hello. Causality is coherent—each magical rule (feather, stone, nightly substitution) emerges in sequence and triggers the next shift in understanding or space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: “home” is redefined as a daily vocal practice, with cost anchored in the acknowledged past self-betrayal. There are no orientation or lens slips; the single POV and continuous movement through the store keep the piece legible despite its lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → recognition of the trap → engagement with the tapestry → dilemma at the border → deliberate, ethically different resolution. Causality is tight under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each action on the threads producing incremental temporal return. Closure is strong: the village partially reanimates, the pigeons remain frozen as a chosen constraint, and the narrator’s self-forgiveness begins on the page. No orientation debt; the world’s rules are taught through interaction and paid off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → poetry experiment → canyon’s response → renegotiated price → communal offering → new understanding. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the poetry sessions and echoes literally lead to the canyon reframing the cost and to the artist’s double payment. Closure is strong and legible: the ritual’s original rule (one voice taken) is conceptually repriced into a shared, refracted cost with a felt emotional consequence. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece runs on a mostly causal, lyric-accumulative spine: work on the engine → decision to use the charm → activation → reconfigured stance. Closure is clear: he gains not Mira’s return but the “pattern of her choosing,” leading to his sharpened, bearable hope and the workshop’s brief reprieve. The acid, fumes, and cistern create a stable constraint while the statue-rib alignment and final pendulum act as a clean structural build to the climax. It falls just shy of higher-tier perfection because the inciting choice and cost are more emotionally than situationally sharpened, leaving a touch of softness in the external turn.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clear, accumulative journey: mirror cracks → decision to enter caves → wrong turn to oasis → corridor revelation → single brushstroke → renunciation and return to harbor. Causality stays intact and legible, with the wrong turn paying off as the necessary access point to the true “inside of the sea.” Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist reorients their practice and self-conception while accepting division (the cracked mirror) rather than trying to erase it. The cost—leaving the numinous space and not “fixing” either mirror or life—is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: preparatory ritual → choice to beckon by scent → subtle response from sea, freighter, and mentor. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mentor’s silence and the altered key of the village mark a before/after in how their work is understood. Causality is soft but legible within the magical-real frame (hum + vial + scent → seam of calm → ship adjusts course). Stakes remain modestly scaled, but within that frame the arc feels complete and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: from failing hydraulics and cryptic calls → construction of the device → beacon pointing inland → journey to the old shelter → ritual with censer and needle → conceptual turn about reverse migration. Causality is intact even in lyric mode, and the closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with cost: the narrator surrenders the fantasy of return for a harder, ongoing work of “charting what we cannot repair.” The before/after is legible and paid for emotionally; the final promise to “answer the next midnight call” lands as Earned Stasis within that new understanding. Transitions between station and journey are smooth, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: establishing the orchard and eye, introducing the inspectors as external pressure, then moving into the first ritual session as closure. Causality holds under a textural lens—each move (smuggling via truffles, hiding the eye, inviting the patrol to watch) feels like a logical outgrowth of the prior constraints. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the group has tested the method under real risk and chosen to continue, with the final image of the warming eye reweighting all prior talk of containment and safety. Stakes remain intimate rather than explosive, but for this scale they’re legible and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is tight: the inciting incident (dying stranger + Edelweiss + pointing) flows cleanly into investigation on the dock, discovery of the notch, recalled backstory of the girl, and culminates in the lighthouse signal. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is sound—each physical clue (notch, scratches, flower) and recalled image escalates toward the decision to send the specific light pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the keeper fulfills the stranger’s request and adopts the ongoing burden of witness, with the ledger entry and swept dock marking an earned stasis with cost. Orientation (where, who, when) is clear early and remains coherent without any lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean and resonant: Ruth’s old instructions → midsummer return → following ants → cavern → chip in seam → hallway choice → creek crossing. Closure lands as a decisive change: the narrator chooses to step where the reflections overlap and then cross the rising creek, reconfiguring their relationship to decisions and promises. Cost is legible in the relinquished safety of the shop’s stasis and the choice not to leave the chip behind as a permanent, easy doorway. The hybrid causal/accumulative drive is stable throughout, with no orientation debt or broken setup-payoff threads.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: final warning → departure → waystations → grotto → integration choice, with no orientation confusion. Closure lands as a decisive inner change and reconfiguration—the queen unites with her dream-self, implicitly altering the kingdom’s future and her relationship to power. The prophecy and the moth anecdote both feed coherently into this choice rather than arriving as patches. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than concrete, but the “who rules when you go back” frame keeps them legible.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the dare → design of the experiment → execution → emergence of the “proof” → revaluation of ordinary time. Causality is mythic rather than literal, but consistent within the world’s rules, and the closure (capturing a shared “thimble of light” and agreeing to let it tune their days) lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within ~120 words despite lyric diction, so no penalty there. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the secret’s content never feeds back into tactics, so an additional tightening of causal pressure is left on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern early and holds it: cabin → scroll → dream flight → bargaining → waking/patrol. Causal throughline is soft but coherent: grave sighting leads to scroll attention, which leads to dream, which produces the reconfigured map and closing stance. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he doesn’t erase death but reframes his life’s work as walking after his own funeral, narrative as tether and drag. Stakes and cost—accepting non-resurrection, living in chronological confusion with duty intact—are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene from opening the shop through the repair, teaching moment, and offstage birth, closed by the message “We are three.” Causality is strong in a quiet register—his partner’s labor motivates the visit; the screw enables the repair; the shared ritual reframes waiting; the later text pays off the established stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, time is a threat/measure of fear; after, it’s held as a living connection via water and sound. The cost—sitting with remembered terror and present uncertainty—is legible without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a single, coherent ritual beat framed by “a breath between storms,” with a clear before/after: she enters to offload scars and leaves having ingested their transformed runes. Causality is accumulative/textural but sound—the counting to seven, each rune tied to a specific scar/memory, and the burning lungs all funnel into the closing act of drinking. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she doesn’t erase pain but reconfigures it into legible letters internalized as warmth. Nothing essential is left hanging, though the external consequence of failure stays mostly implied and small-scale.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival with an apology goal → ritual to contact Mara → confrontation over leaving → Mara’s implicit demand for restitution → decision to expose the cutters → musical coda. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; each beat deepens rather than resets the situation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she alters her behavior in the living world and reconfigures what “imperfect miracles” can mean. The only limitation is that the whistleblowing choice and its concrete risks pass quickly, leaving some potential pressure on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: entering the temple, engaging the spiral/lectern, testing illusions, then re-defining the role forms a clear before/after. Causality is more spiritual than physical but consistent with the lens, and the closure—becoming a “hinge” instead of an “end”—is a clean Conceptual Repricing with a legible shift in options and responsibility. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the “universe’s hiccup” backstory stays anchored to present choices. The main limitation is that costs remain mostly conceptual, so the sense of constraint at the end is strong but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, and the structural throughline—from routine watch, to noticing Basin Three’s lag, to blood on the key, to the “boundary event” realization—holds cleanly. Orientation (who/where/when) is established almost immediately, and the reflection/backstory is always anchored in concrete present stimuli, so the pattern reads deliberate rather than diffuse. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the protagonist redefines the purpose of the station and their own labor (“not to pace minutes but to shepherd edges”), and this is concretely enacted in the note to the foreman and the decision to leave the anomaly uncorrected. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than narratively perilous, which keeps this just shy of a 9+ under an elite-market lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single-night pass through the farm: cue → anomaly/cat/ruptured seal → philosophical and procedural adjustments → closure with a redefined edge. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and it holds: repetition of “permeable barriers,” anomalies, and her handling of thresholds builds toward the final repricing of what a “wall” is. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where both farm and Mara “know [their] edges again,” with a conceptual cost (accepting ongoing permeability rather than decisive safety). Stakes and turns are intentionally quiet, so the piece stops shy of a fully decisive, high-cost change.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: hospital crisis → library quest → alcove discovery → bus ride back with reconfigured intent, all causally linked through the subway scrawls. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural with a stable causal spine, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes risk and her father’s legacy on the bus. The price—living with a paradox rather than a clean rejection—is clear. No orientation debt; the pattern of lyrical reflection anchored in concrete moments remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the early pattern of misdirected calls and wrong-number rituals sets up the later emergency so the child’s trapped-elevator situation feels like a charged variation, not a bolt from nowhere. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Mara applies her method under real stakes, accepts the cost of staying outside the encounter, and records the night as a lesson. Causality is soft but coherent—no glaring breaks—and the cost is legible in Rojo’s goodbye-less hang-up and Mara’s chosen distance, though the global drive remains more textural than tightly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → consultation → ritual of recounting proximate causes → jetty walk → reunion, with a clear before/after in the woman’s relational state and the archivist’s belief in his work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and the final image (“sealed the entry with salt”) has cost in the implied risk of renewed covenant. The man’s appearance at the end leans a bit on coincidence rather than a fully earned causal turn, which slightly softens the drive lens but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rumor → gathering → rules/objects → power outage → improvised relief → trolley arrival, all under one coherent night. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator recognizes the cure for loneliness is already present (“you are holding one end and someone else is holding the other”) and then acts on the favor map. Causality is lyrical rather than hard-edged, but there are no orientation issues and each beat grows logically from the previous. The only limitation is that costs remain mostly conceptual and gentle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: rumor → entry into forest → following the note-trail → clearing → stillpoint → reconfigured inner map, with each phase deepening rather than resetting. Causality is clean in a lyric mode: tactics (ring, note-trail, tactile language-reading) lead directly to the stillpoint discovery, which in turn reweights the protagonist’s relationship to grief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the map is now “inside me, not ink but marrow,” and the choice to return carrying the stillpoint is clear and costly. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the only slight limitation is that external obstacles remain minimal, keeping tension more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival in the Quiet → first signal → terrace-writing experiment → retroactive seed shipment, with each step reweighting what “editing history” means. The closure functions as a clear Conceptual Repricing/RR: history has already shifted, and the protagonist’s past failure is now reframed through the manifested seeds. Causality within the speculative frame holds; the retrocausal manifest is foreshadowed by Del’s explanation of clauses and bowls, not dropped as a patch. Stakes remain focused on one dominant throughline (guilt over bad crops and the possibility of repair) without stray subplots.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: each beat (signing, mapping, bell, surrendering the map) deepens the central process rather than advancing a conventional plot. Causality holds under the chosen lens: Arin’s decisions build toward the conceptual closure that “song remembers you.” Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the stakes of memory and erasure are repriced with a tangible cost (accepting being forgotten in exchange for the song’s life). The only limitation is the relatively low external pressure, which keeps escalation gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal throughline—return to archive → following artistic clues → uncovering ledger of names → planting seeds → reinterpreting the arson—holds cleanly and supports a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. Each artistic object provides a motivated “therefore” rather than a random puzzle, and the final vow logically arises from what she discovers. Closure lands: the meaning of the city, the fire, and her role all shift in a legible before/after. Stakes stay mostly conceptual and emotional, which slightly mutes the sense of immediate jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with causal links: intention → drumming → garden response → bridge → crack → Mira’s awakening, all under the experimental-treatment frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they succeed in reuniting, but at the explicit cost of hosting donor-memories and remaining under institutional control. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the drive lens (accumulative/causal hybrid) holds consistently. The slight limit is that institutional consequences and future constraints are gestured at more conceptually than dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is cleanly structured: challenge → search through the maze → retrieval → demonstrated payoff with Rade’s surrender, all causally linked. The global drive reads as Hybrid—causal rescue plot carrying an accumulative argument about sound, secrecy, and steel. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Rade’s question and Ivo’s final line reweight the entire episode as proof of a different way of working. The missing courier feels solved slightly too easily, with limited sense of jeopardy or sacrifice, which keeps this short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, lyric pattern early—dock, guardian, mirror, shutters, water—and then deepens rather than “turns” in a conventional causal sense. Causality is nonetheless clean: the meeting leads to light-weaving, which leads to the narrator confronting their brother’s death and their own silence, culminating in the choice to bear and use the mirror. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules (light, dark, grief) are reweighted as the narrator’s stance toward darkness and voice changes. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of pure silence and the acceptance of a complicated, ongoing responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: planning → procession to the grotto → synchronized window shift → communal slowing, all under one continuous temporal arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s relation to decision-making is reweighted, with the stalemate ritual and town’s pause as the on-page turn. Causality is soft but coherent; each step emerges naturally from the coach’s choices. The lack of any substantial complication or pushback keeps the structure from feeling fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: island appears → scrimshaw is found → whale song answers → protagonist names self and crosses, with a clear before/after in selfhood and in the island’s persistence. The closure unit (naming themself, crossing, then vowing to ferry others) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a real conceptual/emotional cost. Causality is stable within the fabulist rules and the drive lens is consistent. The only limitation is that external consequences of failure remain abstract, so the closure’s price is primarily internal rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece works on an accumulative/textural lens: the mandate world and performance ritual accrete through domestic beats (sink, inspector visit, children, off-mic lesson) toward a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is consistent—inspection risk and constant surveillance shape every tactic, and the off-mic lesson plus the final broadcast line pay off the earlier “Behold” performances with a subversive twist. Closure is strong: the stance crystallizes around “lightness” instead of joy, with cost implied by the ongoing risk and the “vacancy where victory should sit.” The middle does flirt with a slight sense of vignette drift, but the throughline of mandate-performance vs hush keeps it coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: the gathering, the poet’s actions, the synchronized breathing, crossing the inlaid line, and finally stepping onto the lake create a clear before/after progression. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community moves from enforced separation and internalized fear to a risky but grounded collective crossing, with on-page cost (the ex-guard’s surrender of authority, physical venturing onto ice). Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each ritual act deepens and enables the next. There are no dangling setups or structural confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is accumulative/textural but coherent: courtyard → market → trade → awakening → choice to stay → shared practice with visitors, all causally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ivo does not gain color but a new way of perceiving beauty, then decisively chooses to remain and work in this language of heat, breath, and fracture. Costs are on-page (surrendering his best brush, the jar of smoke, relinquishing the dream of “normal” color perception). The pattern of phoenix cycles and plant-messages gives the ending a clear before/after with felt conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, station-by-station structure is clear and purposeful, with the laboratory frame and the pilgrimage request from the consortium providing a clean spine. Causality is soft but coherent: each bell’s experiment teaches a mode of connection, culminating in the crystal bell and the explicit braid metaphor. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pilgrimage becomes an ongoing social practice that redefines connection post-outage, with a felt though quiet cost in living with unresolved grief and uncertainty. The structure never loses orientation, but the pressure curve remains gentle, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: initial arrival and activation of the observatory’s mechanism set a pattern that deepens through the sessions with strangers, culminating in the mother and dead child tattoos. Causality is clean—her rock-bottom state → return to observatory → repurposing Devin’s design → establishing a ritual that others then enter. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: “This is the work I have after hitting rock bottom” reweighs all prior beats into a chosen vocation with visible emotional cost. The before/after is legible and paid for in the acceptance that she will remain with grief as livelihood, not something to escape.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: a sequence of client encounters teaching a pattern that culminates in the “ribbon festival” image. Causality is coherent and orientation is clean; each vignette follows logically from their practice and the post-crash city. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act—the final scene reframes their work as building a chorus rather than finding lost people. The cost (living in a city of wrecked futures, accepting any payment, working within limits) is present but conceptual, not sharply dramatized in the final beat, which keeps the ending strong but not yet arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative ascent through landings into the top chamber forms a clean, legible structure, each level altering the narrator’s options (mirrors, tablets, compass, names). Closure lands via a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: the narrator reframes the archive as “permissions” rather than facts and chooses alteration over extraction, then carries that stance into the teaching coda. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—choices about refusal, pattern-breaking, and speaking the names clearly shape what the archive reveals. The before/after is distinct: they enter as a credentialed seeker of forbidden knowledge, exit as someone who has sacrificed publication for alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from premise (library of dreams) to problem (unbound shadow) to investigation (reels) to constraint (jealous library / tightening vines) to costly bargain (Mira’s sacrificed dreams). Causal links are clear under a lyric surface: studying footage reveals the shadow’s growing independence, leading to the stone tactic, which in turn provokes the library’s resistance and necessitates the trade. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Mira’s life unlived is surrendered; the library and Ilen both change state, and the world’s rules (what the library takes and gives) are reweighted in the last paragraph. The before/after is legible and satisfying without explanatory overkill.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the revealed con and financial collapse frame the night’s work, and each action (surgery, stripping artifice from the terrarium, composing the letter) deepens the same central pressure rather than branching. Causality is steady—because the con gutted the shelter, she must both save the chameleon with limited means and re-earn trust—and the closure image of the tail tip and brochure as paired relics delivers a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear very early (who, where, what’s wrong) and the reflection is tightly anchored to concrete tasks. The only ceiling is that overt “plot” turns are minimal; it leans heavily on mood and reflection, which it handles well but not at a transcendent level.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure (tower → backstory of tunnel collapse → present-day return and ritual) is coherent and causally legible, with no orientation debt. The closure beat—smashing the hourglass, planting the ivy, and reframing closure as “not a gate but a garden”—is a clear conceptual repricing with emotional cost (relinquishing a miracle and a link to Mira). Each earlier motif (coffee rings, hourglass, plants’ whispers) is paid off at the end without mechanical over-explanation. Escalation is primarily internal, but the movement from avoidance to decisive ritual still tightens options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: arrival → setup in the booth → psychometry/warehouse walk → personal discovery → reconfiguration of what “goodbye” means. Causality within the lyric frame holds, with tactile cues (film, letters, projector) reliably triggering deeper psychic “aisles.” Closure is strong: her act of writing a new “goodbye” that says “stay” and marking the shelf produces a clear before/after in how unused love is understood and handled. The cost—confronting her own deferred life and leaving a trace for the “next wanderer”—is conceptual but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: repeated circuits through the arch, tracing falling stars, entering the room of blank pages, and delivering the written starlight to the sculptor build toward a clear closure beat. Causality within this lyric frame is sound—studying charts → using the instrument → opening the “door” → freeing the sculptor—and no crucial step feels unmotivated. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: by the end, the city and night themselves have altered in relation to silence and speech, with the narrator’s role stabilized at a cost. A slightly clearer articulation of the initial inciting incident (what first drove them to this arch now) would strengthen structural crispness under an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the guard’s charm engages the divergent archive, which gradually stabilizes from “occasionally everywhere” into a contained, generative presence, culminating in spores that reconfigure the train and world. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the archive sleeps, the clock “breathes on its own,” spores illuminate the train, and the guard resumes his route with altered cargo and confirmed duty. Causality is clear within a lyric frame—each move (humming, flipping the clock, choosing a bottled night, not looking too soon) yields a discernible next state. The cost is conceptual but legible: he remains dreamless and bound to vigilance in a wounded world, even as he’s enabled a fragile, moving rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: hum shifts to ache → search via wind method → discovery of the clock-tree → insertion of the gear → opening of the ravine-shelter and notebook revelation. Orientation (who/where/what rules) is quick and consistent despite the surreal setting, and the sixth sense rules hold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the added second recalibrates his sense and reframes his translocations as a pedagogical pattern, with the “wild frontier” understood as interior distance. The cost—accepting ongoing dislocation as necessary rather than accidental—is present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: vigil → ferry encounter → ridge traversal → final acceptance of courage. Each beat logically unfolds from the prior—boarding the skiff leads to the ridge, the ridge to choosing fear-shaped bends, and those choices to the capacity to finally reach. Closure is strong: the skiff “nest inside my chest” and the courage fitting where the star was pressed clearly mark a before/after with conceptual cost. It’s slightly more textural than tightly causal, but the drive lens holds and the ending lands firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival → initiation in the training room → long winter of adaptation → radiators’ Morse message → climactic decision to remain and reconfigure safety’s terms. Causality is lyric but legible: each new element (bolt, stair, cobalt window, radiators) meaningfully extends the prior situation rather than resetting it. Closure lands cleanly via a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: safety’s price is renegotiated, not abolished, and the cost (taxed throats, disciplined pain, limited hope) remains on the page. The only constraint keeping this from the 9-band is that escalation and the winter passage, while effective, stay mostly summarized rather than dramatized in one or two sharply focused on-page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Serane follows the trail of cryptic messages into a curated reading sequence, the rune of drift aligns time and text, the ink pellet reveals her true name, and she withdraws her claim. Causality is intact and elegant—“he did not swing blades; he arranged mirrors and waited for pride to trip”—and the closure (her self-sundering and the court’s dawn without coronation) lands with clear conceptual and social cost. Orientation is excellent from the first line: we know who, where, and the weird rules of this place quickly, and they remain consistent. The quiet but decisive change in the world beyond the library gives the story a satisfying before/after without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is well controlled: instruments → key labeled Assemble → rhythmic logs → realization of a moving corridor → communal test of the path. Causality is legible under a textural lens, and the closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the “road” is time-bound geometry, not a fixed place, and the narrator’s continued tapping is a form of Earned Stasis. Stakes (villagers drowning, the honesty/“uselessness” of red lines) feed directly into the solution of timing lanterns to the corridor’s rhythm. The only thing holding this just under 9 is that the initial “vanishings” pressure is intense but remains largely off-stage, softening the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: tremor → discovery of the stone circle → experimental contact → revelation of the Lark’s fate → decision to broadcast. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the single continuous scene maintains coherence. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration: her new knowledge about the Lark and the map changes the rebellion’s options and her own role. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than visceral, but the risk of “waking whoever had silenced” the system provides enough pressure to make the turn meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: plant whispers → kite discovery → council refusal → clandestine descent → ritual unsealing → communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing: the valley’s destiny is now co-authored via the learning tree rather than imposed via “implanted destiny.” Cost is present but subtle—Lida openly violates an oath, invites political fallout, and binds the valley to a living structure whose consequences are unresolved but clearly irreversible. Structure is linear, well-scaled for the length, and never loses orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece uses an accumulative structure where small present tasks and memories build toward a clear reconfiguration of Rafi’s relationship to his past and his work. The helicopter/gull incident is a central tightening, showing his coping method under pressure, and the niece + logbooks sequence extends that into a shared archival care. Closure lands cleanly when he reopens and refolds the photograph with a new steadiness—an Earned Stasis that acknowledges cost. Causality is soft but coherent; nothing important turns on coincidence or unexplained leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: discovery of the threaded tarot → reconstruction of the keeper’s intent → descent to the failed mechanism → repurposing the threads into a functional wick → reillumination and a new ledger entry. Causality is tight even in a lyric mode; each step logically arises from the previous (“If the keeper had threaded the deck…then perhaps…” directly motivates her mapping and later engineering). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the before/after is legible in the relit beam, her new identity as keeper, and the tower itself seeming to widen rather than close in. The cost—taking responsibility in solitude, facing the dark instead of fleeing it—is implicit but palpable in those final acts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: investigate the encampment → read the ink → discover the metronome-algorithm → enter its “heart” and refuse power, causing it to forget how to count. Causality holds within a lyric/speculative frame, and the accumulative pattern of ink-reading leads logically to the conceptual reveal. Closure is strong: the metronome’s forgetting and the narrator’s chosen disappearance create a clear before/after with conceptual cost. Stakes and world rules stay coherent enough that the symbolic turns feel earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build from discovery of the letter, through contemplation and hesitation, to the decisive act at the grid reset and its diffuse consequences. Causality is tight within a lyric mode: reading → temptation → plan via conduits → timed release → city’s subtle behavioral shifts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s communicative possibilities have changed, and the archivist’s relationship to preservation is reweighted, with conceptual and professional cost implied. The only thing holding this below 9 is that the repercussions remain largely atmospheric rather than facing a concrete on-page counterpressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from frame (tower’s fall, dome) to visitors’ arrival, to ritual with the rose, to the father’s letter, each beat tightening around blame and mercy. Backstory is always anchored to tangible present stimuli (sandbag scrap, irrigation, trellis) and directly tilts the present choices. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the farm becomes “a hinge…turning ruin toward renewal,” with the father’s absence and ongoing blame as the price of that stance. Causality within the lyric design is consistent; nothing crucial feels arbitrary or retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural but coherent: he comes to fish for a voice, contacts the goddess, receives a conditional bargain, then fulfills it by walking the aisles and returning the coastline. Each movement follows a clear “because/therefore” logic under the story’s surreal rules, and the rail spike/constellations thread is kept tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he internalizes then relinquishes the coastline-map, restoring it to the tide. The cost—releasing what he’s just gained rather than keeping the power—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: journalist’s call → ascent → wager/test → world stalls → ethical decision and re-opening. The device test provides a clear tightening and a concrete, on-page reversal when the printer stops and exchanges hiccup. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing (redefining the observatory’s mission and “gravity” of media) with a legible cost in responsibility, even if institutional fallout is only implied. Orientation is solid from the opening; no temporal or spatial confusion undermines the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is remarkably coherent: letters → recorder → client + baby → self-tattoo form a clear chain under a lyric surface. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration when she inks the glyph on herself and chooses to “stay and listen,” with her old refusal explicitly crossed by the tether line. Causality inside the fabulist frame is clean—no set-ups go unused, and the letters/cabinet/amber all pay off in the final beats. The emotional and conceptual cost of staying with her guilt is on the page in sentences like “I could not breathe…” and the inward-pointing map.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the grotto and ritual setup, the emergent hush and the man’s deflection, the interjection/tile placement pivot, then the child’s articulation and the closing repricing of “mess.” Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each move deepens the central practice rather than introducing new threads. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the hush is given a “want” and the narrator responds by smudging the map, implying a before/after stance toward certainty. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic but legible: the comfort of “lovely lies” and neat maps is renounced in favor of ongoing, uncomfortable mess.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean causal line—boy seeks renaming → revelation about the men → confrontation and renaming under the plaza’s “grammar”—within an accumulative, lyric mode. Orientation is strong from the opening: we know who (the steel-armed narrator), where (plaza), and when (after the great fire) almost immediately. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the choice to rename the guilty into roles of repair, and the past loosening when the tessera is set down, mark a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The only mild limit is that the external risk around confronting the men and crowd remains mostly implied rather than dramatized into sharper beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean for an accumulative/lyric piece: closing the store → entering maze/orchard → ritual with coin and echoes → visible timeline crack → anchoring the Star → gentle exit. Causality is soft but coherent under the textural drive lens: their practiced ritual leads to the maze’s rearrangement and the leaf-door opening, and the visible fracture plus chorus intrusion provides a clear mid-beat tightening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: they again “finish letting go” and commit to repeating the work tomorrow, with the coin cooling and the maze relaxing back to ordinary. Stakes and cost are more implied than explicitly tested, so the final shift feels lovely but not fully hard-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: a single session in the studio that moves from setup, through the static shock and refined method, to a soft but legible reconfiguration. Causality holds—pill regimen → somatic markers → structured passes of the wand → memory access → printed map—and the ending image (geode left dull, method retained) provides closure. The static shock functions as a mid-scene tightening, though it feels slightly arbitrary rather than deeply enmeshed with their emotional stakes. Cost is present but subtle, more in the reconfigured stance toward memory than in any stark before/after turn.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: arrival and preparation → establishing thermal grammar → discovery of the “throat” chamber → storm surge test → renewed contract and departure. Causality is coherent (sensors → green “openness” vein → chamber → heightened emotional temperature → contract via fossil → storm forces reassertion of that contract), and the world’s rules feel consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fossil becomes resident, the contract is affirmed, and her future role is reweighted with the recorded promise. The cost is quieter and more conceptual than visceral, but it’s on the page and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: theft → experimental method with buttons → communal opening of the warehouse → reframed role of prophecy and the narrator’s oath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—prophecy reframed from line to loom, warehouse from vault to commons—with a clear before/after. The causal chain is soft but intact; the only limitation is that consequences (e.g., institutional backlash, personal jeopardy) remain conceptual rather than acutely felt in a specific, pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: Ansel returns to the bluff to meet Len, encodes messages, receives an unexpected emotional test (the ring), then makes a decisive choice about the microfilm that reconfigures his future. The structure is essentially one continuous, well-oriented scene with accumulative lyric texture, and closure is clear: exile gives way to a tentative reintegration and a new mode of courage (RR + DC). The main weakness is that the concrete cost of destroying the microfilm remains abstract—its strategic value is implied but never quite sharpened into a felt loss—so the stakes of that specific act could be more pointed. Nonetheless, the before/after of Ansel’s options and identity is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous crossing framed by arrival and departure, with the stitching of the map as the central action. Causality is intact (map + promise → ferry crossing → reconfigured “road”), and the accumulative, lyric drive is consistent. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the hills and road are re-seen, and the promise becomes embodied in the map-sail and their forward motion. The cost—living with, not erasing, fear and past burdens—is present but somewhat understated, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is accumulative/textural, cohering cleanly from arrival through ritual to conceptual closure. The lantern glass and timelines escalate in a clear because/therefore chain: seeing the fractures → offering “small lights” → timelines braiding tighter → her final understanding and decision to carry this practice onward. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves, but with a reweighted understanding of change/resistance and a self-imposed ethical trajectory, and the oasis continues its gentle shift. The cost—time, the last of her water, and leaving the safety of an “alive” place for the wasteland again—is legible though understated.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal line is clean: the last petal as trigger → decision to go → journey by skiff → lockpicking → restoring and lighting the lantern → conceptual extension back to the fire escape. Orientation is excellent from the opening and never in doubt, and the accumulative structure of small tasks builds toward a clear closure image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the act of relighting the lighthouse redefines the narrator’s ongoing caretaking of small urban spaces, with an implied cost of ongoing vigilance and grief work. Stakes are mostly intimate and conceptual rather than narratively harrowing, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: calm cataloging → disturbance as the stone circle falters and shelves drop → tactical response using sundial and herd song → restored, reconfigured equilibrium. Causality is legible under a textural lens: environmental shifts press the narrator into action, which in turn retunes the system. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “weather” becomes “shelter” via the new word and the prepared table of listening, with ongoing solitude as the implicit cost. The drive and rules are stable, though the crisis remains more symbolic than sharply delineated in concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival and setup of the installation, community participation, the lovers’ entrance, and the orchestrated reveal of the letters all build toward the reunion. Causality is coherent—the ghostwriter’s deliberate choices (nest spiral, threads, bowl, hidden letters) directly enable the climax. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers physically rejoin, the letters are voiced by strangers, and the narrator’s understanding of their own work shifts. The cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishing of secrecy to communal reading and in the vulnerability demanded of the lovers.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal throughline is clean: strange signal → investigation → recognition of manipulation → active countering → negotiated détente and redefined role. The structure escalates coherently from studio unease to rooftop confrontation and citywide psychic shift, then into a reflective but still pressurized denouement. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she refuses power’s neatness, accepts a messier, slower community, and repurposes the signal’s gift into an emergency channel, with the cost of ongoing vigilance and foregone prestige on the page. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the hybrid causal/lyric drive is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clear and clean: summon the city with the organ → stabilize the alleys via compass/sound → retrieve the key → use it at the Observatory → reconceive the mutiny. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: realizing the “mutiny was not refusal, only a hunger to be heard,” reweights everything from the organ-calling to the key’s recovery. Stakes are mostly conceptual and emotional (relationship to the city, defiance of the Council), with risk implied rather than tested, so the felt cost at the end is subtle rather than bracing. Structure is tight, single-trajectory, and free of loose setups.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: quarry search → object discoveries → conceptual reconstruction → studio painting and letters, all under a single reflective lens. Causality is soft but consistent for a lyric mode (find ribbon → reconsider assumed mask → hypothesize identity trade → create painting as response), and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “solving” a case can mean. The cost—no perpetrator named, only empathy offered—is legible and thematically charged. A slightly clearer tightening of present-time stakes at the quarry itself would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: journals → discovery of the panel → insertion of the nail → exiles returning → confrontation with the director, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration of the exile system. Closure is solid, with the world’s rules reweighted (“the mists now braided both directions”) and a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the reversal of exile and the director’s loss of control feel slightly easy; his resistance doesn’t seriously endanger the new state or impose a concrete cost on the protagonist. Still, structure and causality are tight and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a primarily causal lens, the sequence from disappearance → discovery of the shard/map → descent under the bridge → musical “payment” and reunion is coherent and well-motivated. The ledger/magic rules are implied but consistent enough to support the climactic act of playing “the measure that forgives.” Closure is solid: the ledger “signs a receipt,” his arm is physically present, and her stance shifts toward counting futures, with an emotional cost implied in her willingness to engage the system. Structure is essentially one continuous arc with lyric infill, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative structure from twilight return through rise/fall of the startup to the tiger-car realization is clear and cohesive, with each beat reweighting the central question of paths and ownership. Causality is soft but present (startup → investors → overreach → collapse), and the abandoned circus train anchors the shifting time frame. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the rut and imagined father reframe all prior mapping as a hunted/hunter circle with a palpable emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence, and the lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: from unopened telegram and long-term temple obsession to the joint star-reading that reframes what “decoding” requires. Causality is coherent—dreams → method with variable stars → Mara’s request → cooperative experiment → conclusion that conversation is the true lock. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s practice of witnessing is recast as the necessary key, with a new ongoing commitment. Stakes remain small and interior, but the before/after is legible and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: failed trick → stolen confession → specialized retrieval method → lie-eating seed → public revelation and lake’s calming. The structure is single-scene, tightly focused, with one clear drive (retrieve the truth) and a decisive, on-page closure where stakes materially shift for town, mayor, and narrator. The cursed lake’s rule-set (keeping dropped or refused things) is introduced and then exploited without cheat, and the final “receipt for deliverance” lands as a resonant recalibration. The only limitation is that resistance is relatively smooth; nothing meaningfully threatens to derail her method once the thread is found.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: past covenant → present breach and visitors → joining scars → maze journey → confrontation with gardeners → new vow and reconfigured maze. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens, with each surreal turn growing logically from the previous image-rules (hedges, pool, clipping, scars). Closure is solid: the decisive refusal to restore the noon covenant and the braiding of a new vow, recorded in cambium, create a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The cost is more thematic than visceral, so the ending lands more as conceptual repricing than as a sharply felt sacrifice, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: enter market → consult Weaver → find boy → perform barter → pay with grandmother’s stories → choose to remain as caretaker. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid, with the cost of relinquishing the last of the grandmother’s stories and accepting an ongoing role. Stakes are more spiritual/ethical than situational, and while they read clearly, pressure could tighten once more before the ritual succeeds to reach true exceptionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense cataloging, interleaved with quarry-show backstory and the recent appraisal failure, steadily reweight the central decision about how to treat the scrap. Causality under a textural lens holds: each reflection is anchored to a concrete present cue and tilts his stance toward the final revaluation. Closure lands in the act of pricing the scrap differently and recommending museum placement—an on-page conceptual repricing with emotional cost. Nothing crucial feels withheld or patched; orientation is stable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → diagnosis (rails drifting, serenade gone) → ritual work → planting the seed → arbor’s reweighting and the narrator’s reframed understanding. Causality is intact and legible, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing the wish to command transition). The physical stakes (trunks sparking, orchard stability) are stated but never pushed into a palpable brink, so pressure feels moderate rather than acute. Still, the piece delivers a clear before/after in stance and arbor-state.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent from the opening rule-set—tides, atrium, creel, migrating identities—through the metallurgy-beat and back to the closing clerkship of tides. The encounter with the kelp-coated woman provides a clear interior tightening and a legible before/after: her identities resolve into a true name, and the narrator recommits to his custodial role under a slightly reweighted understanding of memory as “wonder doing chores.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, but the cadence shift and the bells’ “keep, keep, keep” crystallize stakes and cost. Causality is appropriately soft for this mode yet consistent; no set-up is dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: the job → cave → shell → confessions → directive → spire → crowning → world reconfiguration forms a coherent progression. The closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with the inspector rejecting “survival approved, hearts separated” and logging the site as “unfit for isolation, habitable for communion.” Causality is soft-lyric rather than mechanical, but each step is motivated and there’s no orientation debt. The cost—betraying institutional rules for a new ethic of connection—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: station → restroom graffiti → sluice gate → shallow, each step causally triggered by the last and deepening the reckoning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration when she enters the shallow, counts to twelve, and accepts a new “honest” number from the river, then formally records that she will stop asking it to be her. Stakes and goal are clear from early on, and every major beat serves the pilgrimage toward that closure. No orientation or causality slips meaningfully undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: first letter → journey with the watch → threshold test at the door → deciphering and entering the library → composing the unsounded second letter. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she accepts a new role and cost (returning the first letter to fire, living with echo and delay) that clearly reweights the opening premise of “between two fateful letters.” Causality is gently surreal but consistent under the textural lens, with the watch and library rules coherently shaping each turn. Stakes remain mostly metaphysical, but they are legible and pay off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece is tightly structured around a single ticking-clock scene—pre-noon in the observatory—anchored cleanly in who/where/when. The causal spine is solid: museum visit impending → dream and promise resurface → divination and plant-voices frame options → he chooses to play, causing the violin’s destruction and foreclosing the archival path. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change with cost: the empire loses the artifact; Ilya sacrifices professional security and the violin itself to let the story propagate. The accumulative lyric texture supports, rather than obscures, this causal throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean ritual structure—arrival, preparation, activation, reception of the message, sealing and departure—with every step causally linked. The drive lens is accumulative/textural: aurora, static, chip, and balm layers build toward a conceptual reconfiguration of what “one last spark” means. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she achieves her goal in a limited, ethically bounded way and returns with a “seed” rather than a miracle, and that before/after is legible and costly. There are no orientation issues; the floating grotto, guild technology, and ritual timeline are all clear enough to support the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches an accumulative structure cleanly: pilgrimage → threshold (hairpin/comb slit) → inner chamber caretaking → dream/awakening → re-emergence with reweighted understanding. Causality is intact and legible—the hairpin opens the wall; pruning and planting alter the chamber; sleep/dream mediates the internal shift—and the closure (contentment is tending, not owning) is clearly earned. The cost of surrendering the hairpin and accepting ongoing, cyclical duty is on the page and conceptually charged. Escalation is subtle rather than high-pressure, but each stage narrows options in a coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a situational lens: hike to lighthouse → set up chimes via father’s method → three patterns/choices → deliberate selection of the third path. Orientation is strong from the dunes through to the gallery, and the lighthouse ritual gives the decision a focused, temporal container. Closure lands decisively when they choose public confession with conditions, with the cost (money returned, naming officials, tax reversal) explicitly stated. There are no loose setup/payoff strands; the only small limitation is that the campfire argument is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens pre-lighthouse escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: stone → ripples → trance → village vision → conceptual shift → quiet return, with each step causally motivated by the prior ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator adopts a new stance toward presence/absence (“vanished where I hindered, and appeared where space needed”), with visible conceptual and relational cost. The reverse-aging and grotto mechanics are revealed gradually but coherently, and the delayed explanation of the grotto’s pull reweights earlier mystery without feeling like a patch. The only limitation is that the external stakes stay gently scaled; the transformation is profound but largely interior and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: each sensory and ritual step (climb, hum, birds, pulse, casting the arrowhead) deepens a single attempt rather than building plot twists. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator learns to “travel as the birds travel” without moving, keeps an empty cord, and leaves the stones, so their stance toward navigation and tools is clearly altered with conceptual cost. Causality is coherent—each new action arises from the search for the wandering pulse—and orientation (who/where/what-quest) is established early. The one limitation is that the “price” is more conceptual than dramatically pinched; no external consequence tests the new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly two-shard (spire, then city) with clear causal and thematic linkage, operating under an accumulative/textural drive that holds to closure. The climb, keystone insertion, and encounter with light reshape what the protagonist can bring back, and the later street scene pays that off through changed tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role and the keystone’s meaning are reweighted, with the night return to unstrap the stone sealing the stance. Orientation is clear early, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: lamplighter descends with a clear aim, discovers the library and luminous vows, undergoes a progressive re-education in listening, then emerges reconfigured, carrying “silver” as a cost-bearing color. Orientation (harbor → water → ship-library) is legible early, and each move below follows directly from the prior image or realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: sound is re-understood as “colorable weather,” and the protagonist is now bound to a vow that will govern their ongoing life above water. The cost is conceptual and behavioural rather than dramatic, but it is clearly on the page and tied to prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clear for an accumulative, lyric piece: vigil → prophecy received → coins cast → dome turned → noise distilled → corridor of silence → conceptual shift. The backwards prophecy provides a strong organizing spine, with the middle clause fulfilled before consciously noticed, tightening causality in a satisfying way. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator reconceives randomness-as-prayer, with the sense they’re already living the consequence of their choice. Stakes are mostly conceptual rather than situationally urgent, but they’re consistent and scaled appropriately to the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: arrival → ritual setup → intensifying attempts → Miren’s shard → conceptual crystallization and renaming → new ongoing duty. Causality is coherent within the magical premise (cylinders + light + atlas → manifested fears), and the story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: his understanding of sacrifice and naming fundamentally shifts. Cost is on-page—he gains a method but not relief, only “a new corridor of work.” The drive lens is stable and the before/after is legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: bell → dripping observation and counting → pattern discovery → ritual adjustment → partial rebalancing, all in one continuous scene. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Efan “had only rebuilt an echo,” the sea returns only “a fraction,” and the fisherman’s question about hunger makes the price explicit. Causality is clean under a textural/causal hybrid lens—Efan’s methodical choices, not coincidence, trigger the small cosmic correction. The before/after is legible and charged: a world on the edge of collapse vs. one inching back from it, without any sense of cheap repair.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: patrol → found label → trail of photos → remembered meeting → upstream grove → call to gather → communal retelling. Each new photograph and recollection meaningfully reshapes his understanding and narrows his options, culminating in the choice to defy the “neutral” brief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s fate shifts from bureaucratic erasure to being carried “in their mouths as something living.” Causality is tight given the lyric mode, with no orientation debt or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric drive: ritual steps (entering the orchard, consulting starlings, lighting flame, placing the crystal) build toward a reconfiguration rather than a sharp twist. Causality is soft but coherent—each action changes the next option set, especially the decision not to recite formulas after “the theorem’s last clause.” Closure lands cleanly when she seals the reliquary and leaves with “nothing but balance,” clearly marking a before/after. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than plot-heavy, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous approach-and-docking sequence framed by radio static and the incoming supply wing, with backstory used sparingly to charge present stakes. Causality is strong: strange cloud behavior leads to a revised course, signaled through established non-verbal systems, culminating in turbulence, coordinated response, and successful docking. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they survive, trust is partially restored, and the ongoing cost is acknowledged in the final nod and rib-weight image. The drive reads as a Hybrid of causal and accumulative/lyric, held consistently through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is accumulative but clear: training days, petitions, the narrator’s growing dialogue with the jar, realization about “circuit,” and the joint custody decision form a coherent progression. Causality under a textural lens holds: the practices and visions lead to the redefinition of “custody,” and the closure (Conceptual Repricing + internal shift) lands with cost for the narrator’s numbness. The piece maintains orientation in space and stakes without confusion. It does, however, lean more on lyrical build than on sharply dramatized turns, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: storm → mysterious seed → planting → conceptualizing a new room → vow to steward it, with each step logically arising from the prior. The closure functions as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses a path (quiet, limited, meaning-first experiment) that forecloses louder, safer options, and the last image holds that commitment in suspension. However, most friction (landlord, inspectors, investors) remains anticipatory and off-page, so the decisive change is more plan than enacted turn. Orientation and drive are always legible, but the structural tension never quite tightens beyond a thoughtful, lyric meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: he enters the tunnel with an aim, raises his orchestra, sends sound toward the house, receives a returning squeal, and exits with the silence reconfigured. Causality under a lyric/numinous logic holds: his ritual playing prompts the house’s response and the family’s micro-awakening, and the vents/tunnel link actions to effects. Closure is strong and on-page: the house “sighs awake,” laughter becomes “foundational,” and the repaired silence and city rhythm mark a before/after with cost in his effort and solitude. The throughline never tangles despite the metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the frozen garden → negotiation with the guardian via the pendant → instruction and tithe → re-emergence into waking with a reconfigured stance. Causality within this lyric framework is solid—each beat flows from the last, especially the offer to wait leading to the pendant’s test and the later question about thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist leaves by “not leaving,” now carrying thresholds and uncertainty as chosen companions, with a tangible price (part of their breath). Stakes are internal but legible and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story maintains a clean, single-scene causal arc: arrival at the nexus → iterative ritual adjustments → emergence of the frond → decisive breaking of the crozier → stepping through the opening. Orientation is clear very early (who, where, what he wants), and the accumulative ritual structure is legible and purposeful. Closure lands as a decisive change: he irreversibly abandons his ordained role and physically exits into a new “glassy blue” world, with the crozier hissing to ash behind him. The cost—burn, exile from doctrine, and an unknowable future—is directly implied on the page and reframes all prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → ascent with the box → communion with the dead signals → application of the hush and star fragment → descent to the origin room → resurfacing with a reconfigured city. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the city now “keeps time with what it let go,” and the narrator leaves having altered its operating logic. Causality under a textural lens holds—each step builds from the last, especially the shift that occurs once assumptions are discarded. The only limitation is that costs and constraints stay largely conceptual, so the turns feel exquisite rather than sharply perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/situational structure is clear: strange ferry → radio voices → grotto shortcut → ritual → metaphysical door choice, all cohering under the drive to stabilize arrivals. Causality holds within the story’s surreal rules, and the closure—a reconfigured ferry that docks reliably with emotional cost—lands on the page. The cost is conceptual but legible: he accepts the undertow of tide and the limits of permanence, relinquishing pure indeterminacy. Structure is tight for the length, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—a guided walk through successive illusion rooms—teaches its pattern early and holds it cleanly to closure. Each room adds a new facet of his project (breathing walls, hinge of listening, triangle, bridge), culminating in the conceptual turn to mapping the city via habits and agreements, which reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (responsibility, ethical design). Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: his choices with the thread produce each new state of the space. Nothing crucial feels arbitrary or dropped, and the ending cadence is satisfying without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: instructor → practice of edge geometry → tension with city lights → night crawls → aliens’ return and exchanged patterns → reoriented teaching stance. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, and the alien encounter provides a genuine tightening and closure via Conceptual Repricing. Still, stakes remain predominantly conceptual and atmospheric; the aliens’ return doesn’t force a concrete, costly decision so much as confirm and enrich existing practice. The closure feels resonant but not sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: the trembling phones → child’s request → hearing-aid pulses → photograph misreading → discovery of the man → reframing of who called → facilitated connection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s job shifts from cataloging the dead to midwifing a living connection, with grief’s “redial” and “incidental heroism” conceptually repricing the premise. Cost is emotional rather than catastrophic—ongoing grief, dependence on fragile lines—but it’s legible in the shared hush and the man’s nightly ritual. Structure is tight and accumulative, with no dropped setups, though one more explicit consequence or constraint could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is tight and causal under an accumulative lyric surface: tide window → squeeze and panic → lock via fleck/ice → reading the roster → choice to leave the fleck, all in one continuous pressure arc. Orientation is clear from the opening (“cave mouth…under the cliff,” “forgotten research facility”), and backstory is woven in cleanly as it alters present choices. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she completes the machine’s work and sacrifices her talisman, foreclosing the path of theft and anonymity, with cost legible in her hesitation. No major setup is dropped or resolved by coincidence; the war and rumor context stays properly offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: past overexposure → archive loss and team scattering → bureaucratic “death” → return to observatory → contact with ghost → technical and emotional repair. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored flashback, and the drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, with textural motifs (ink, static, shard) reinforcing turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: choosing to align the dish, then let the signal fade, redefines the central problem from undoing damage to living with it. Cost is legible in relinquishing the need for cosmic-scale culpability while accepting responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → experiments with echoes and birds → curse escalation → sacrifice of the travel-name → stable new role and order in the canyon. Causality holds under a textural lens: each new technique (diamond, flock, listeners) deepens the canyon’s response and leads directly to the curse’s demand. Closure lands cleanly when the narrator trades their name for the treaty-choir and chooses to remain as caretaker, with the cost legible in that loss of identity and permanent posting. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is taught early and maintained without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: anomalies → phone confessions → arrowhead contact → planting the tooth → opening of the drain → descent → choice to become keeper. Causality is consistent within the surreal logic (each act, especially using the arrowhead and calling the phone, clearly enables the next turn). The closure is strong: the narrator’s yes and the garden’s metamorphosis of bitterness establish a before/after with a conceptual and personal price. The only limitation is that a few temporal markers (“after the missing return changed”) remain more atmospheric than structurally functional.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: careful playing → memory/response of orchard → statues’ approach → public witness → reconfiguration of orchard and city. Causal links are clear under a lyric frame (softer music and heart-signal cause the orchard’s awakening and statues’ hesitation), and the piece lands a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: before, beauty is suppressed; after, the system is visibly altered. The risk of failure is clearly articulated, though no partial negative consequence lands on the page beyond tension. Overall, drive and closure read coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: routine route → anomalous jar → visit to Mina → storm-vision → redirected delivery to the boy, culminating in a quiet but legible reconfiguration of his role. The accumulative structure and lyric mode are taught early and held consistently, with no orientation debt. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves changed in how he understands his work and where to go, with a concrete act (delivering the letter) that marks the “after.” The cost is soft but present—he knowingly steps further outside regulations in a live-danger environment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: arrival and failed mechanical repair → discovery of oasis → realization that “voice” not power is needed → singing and crowning the horse → communal sharing. Each step grows logically from the last under the established rules (bells, hush, halo fragment, oasis), and no setups are left unused. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the train and carousel move from sleep to vowed tending, with a clear before/after in how silence is understood. The cost—his relinquished silence and assumed stewardship—is legible in the final vow-like lines.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative and lyric but coherent: mentor’s lesson → curvature shelving habit → air sharpening and path opening → journey into the wall-less reading room → return to patrons with the card. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has not reached the origin of stories but has altered her understanding and formally records it under “Promise, Noted.” Causality operates softly but consistently—her deliberate recitation of theorems “like lullabies” reawakens the path instead of the shock her mentor predicted. Stakes and cost are intellectual/emotional rather than plot-heavy, but the before/after in her stance is legible and paid for by accepting incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: odd-hour librarian → photographed pursuit → sea confrontation → capture → re-interpretation in the library → deliberate release. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent, with the dream’s trail and the sea’s bargain logically preceding the pivotal photograph and re-mapping. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator reconceives keeping as passage, and the library’s relationship to the archipelago changes in tandem. The only restraint on a higher score is that cost remains gently conceptual; a slightly more concrete before/after price on the page would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is very clear: problem → hiring the locksmith → journey to the courtyard → twilight/star cue → mirrors/path → singing/reconfiguration. Under a textural lens, each movement meaningfully deepens the central pressure rather than wandering. Closure lands solidly when the “idea of return” is freed and the narrator chooses to keep singing into the world; the cost of relinquishing the locked, wounded form of grief is legible. There are no orientation or causality stumbles despite the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a tight single-POV dive with interleaved backstory that always orients us in the present task, and each step (finding the ring, feeding it truth, accessing the ledger, tasting the apple) follows a clear internal logic. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, but causal connections are solid enough that the final partial recovery of memory feels earned. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has not “won” but altered the ledger of what’s lost and kept. The only small limit is that some mechanics of the supernatural exchange are impressionistic, relying on folk-logic more than sharply dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the decree, preparation, council arrival, tea-leaf reading, and corridor of shadow each layer pressure on the single stake of the library’s fate. Causality is coherent even in a lyric frame: earlier set-ups (the child, bottled dusk, tea leaves) all pay off in the trial. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the council issues a stay, the library’s mandate is partially re-legitimized, and the cost of ongoing, precarious guardianship is felt. The one limitation is that the actual “trial” proceeds quite smoothly, with little on-page risk of true failure beyond the implied threat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: Miren alone with the seed and orchard, then the arrival of the child, then the planting of the charged seed, closing with a reconfigured valley. Causality is soft but coherent—pruning and essence-capture build toward the decision of where and how to plant the seed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the valley’s remembered wonder) with a felt conceptual cost in the insistence on ongoing “careful work,” though the cost remains gentle and largely thematic rather than personal-risk driven.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → ascent to the net → knot-unraveling and memory exhumation → application to masks → ring-and-hearth closure. Causality within the ritual is coherent (loosening knots releases memories, which are then pinned and woven into masks), and the sanctuary/sea’s responses track these actions. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: unrest is transformed into an earned calm, with the tide “accepting the shape of the shore.” The cost is subtle—emotional labor and confrontation with storm-memories rather than a stark sacrifice—keeping this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: torn map → investigation of film → request for keys → discovery and communal opening of the chapel → reframed map and shop note. The structure is linear and cohesive with no orientation debt, and the accumulative/textural drive (silence, stone, maps, breath) holds consistently. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the village’s relationship to the “whispered chapel” and the narrator’s craft are both reweighted, with the map’s visible tear as a conceptual seam. The cost—facing the village’s forgotten space and allowing its quiet to persist on its own terms—is present but quite gentle, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival, exploration of catalog room and map room, deepening engagement with transmissions and artifacts, then ascent. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: “time for air and sorrow” reframes the dive as both technical mission and grief ritual. Causality is soft but legible—each discovered object or record organically leads to the next reflection, and constraints of air, rope, and current shape the endpoint. Escalation is modest, but the pattern holds and the ending feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern early and sustains it: storm approaching, contact with the ghost, collaborative map-making, and civic response form a clean arc. Causality is soft but legible—ghost’s signals → graffiti encoding → humans opening vents and water—culminating in a reconfigured status quo where the city “started to pulse in a rhythm more like living.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts an ongoing role as translator-hinge, at conceptual and emotional cost. The only weakness is that some transitions (from encoding to citywide response) are elided in a mythic register, which slightly mutes the sense of concrete before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ten-floor ascent provides a clean accumulative structure, each rise adding a new layer of information (goggles, diary mechanics, Mirek’s past, the shelves of letters) without losing orientation. The drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: pattern and density build toward a conceptual reconfiguration at the crest. Closure lands when the narrator reinterprets their “retrieval” mission into curating unsent letters and vows to “keep what breaks you where you can love it,” a decisive reframing with conceptual cost. The only limiting factor is that external stakes remain low-key; there is no significant risk or obstruction beyond the emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: string breaks → drift and observation → emotional weather reading → reconnection, with the father’s absence as a throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the experience of being untethered redefines her proof that emptiness remembers, embodied in the blank log lines and the reeling-in of the “spooled wholeness.” Causality is soft but consistent—events follow a clear because/therefore emotional logic even if physical danger is muted. All anchors (who/where/when) are established early and maintained without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: rumor → search → coin → safe → letter/instructions → painting under countdown → collapse → mural endures. Orientation is clear early (who, where, what’s impending), and the coin/safe setup pays off both in the middle turn and in the final signing gesture. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, the room is windowless and doomed; after, it holds a remembered sky that survives the building’s fall. The cost is legible on the page in the demolition and in the artist’s constrained time, with no loose or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor of stranded light → observation of birds + dog-ear grid → hopscotch memory and on-deck board → decoding pattern → steering through luminance → releasing the light and restoring dawn. Closure lands both externally (light unspools; town’s dawn returns) and internally (the narrator commits to “chart the next great discovery”). Cost is more conceptual/emotional than perilous, but there is a real risk in following chalk instructions into an uncanny phenomenon. The accumulative lyricism never obscures what happens, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → prophecies → hall of mirrors → bottle/cedar turn → reading-room/ledger → return, all under a single, coherent drive. Causality is clear even in the lyric mode—the bottle unstoppering and subsequent adjustments directly enable passage and thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves changed, having installed a “steadying heart” and a key, and accepted repair as mutual rather than unilateral. The cost is quiet (relinquishing a piece of his gear and his previous understanding) but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with solid causal links: daily life → Lio’s system of bell and chalk → arch disaster and collective rescue → communal departure toward the nebula. The rescue sequence provides a clear tightening and proof-of-concept for Lio’s methods, which then justifies trust in the final exodus. Closure is strong: the river-of-air launch and glimpse of the nebula function as a resonant reconfiguration of their world with a palpable (if understated) cost of leaving. A slightly clearer sense of concrete risk or sacrifice in the departure would push this closer to elite-level structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from routine description to a charged ritual as the needle leans and politics “learned its favorite thunder again, again.” Orientation is strong from the opening: who, where, when, and what the job is are all quickly legible. The climax—choosing to sing into the hush-charged lighthouse—reconfigures the situation into a vow rather than a mere warning. The closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis, with the cost of only delaying, not averting, ruin clearly implied in the final quiet with the “beautifully flawed machine.”

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyrical frame: strangers enter the orchard, the caretaker must get them out before frost and patrol shifts, and the nut/blueprint mechanics lead to an exit. Orientation is solid early—cliff, labyrinth, birds, orchard—and the “before the night frost forms” clock provides a clear through-line. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: he saves this pair and the orchard loosens slightly, but his larger imprisonment and the continuing cycle are reaffirmed. The only thing holding this below top tier is that escalation and the inciting threat remain relatively low-key and never quite bite down into a single, sharp turning beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean, reflective single-POV slice where past harm is braided with present observation until it culminates in a decisive reorientation. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: watching the river and tracing foam directly leads to the new polymer architecture and the decision to confront the corporate machinery. Closure is strong: she leaves with a specific plan, an altered stance on atonement, and clear costs articulated (“lawsuits and scorn”). There are no orientation issues, and the before/after is legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: opening lull → pursuit of the rumored vault → chamber with apple → hinge opening → return with seed to the original scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the protagonist’s offerings purchase a comma-seed that will only sprout in the precise lull we began in, reweighting the entire opening as precondition rather than mere mood. Causality within the fable-logic holds (quantifying absence enables entry; moonlight + counting opens the hinge) and the before/after is legible with cost in what they relinquish. The piece stays within one coherent window and never loses orientation despite its lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dreamlike opening → blue sand problem → descent to pavilion → cooking and serving → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is steady and legible under a textural lens: rain reveals pavilion, pavilion’s remorse forces a response, cooking subsumes and redistributes that remorse. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the keeper stands taller, the fortress “exhaled its dream,” and the saved coral jars the future. Stakes and cost (risk of emotional contagion, enduring memories rather than erasing them) are clear on the page without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the elevator’s first “hola, shalom, salaam, namaste” leads causally into Mara’s door-knocking, the engineering of bridges, and the choral climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town moves from isolation to a “single breathing structure,” with the elevator’s role conceptually repriced. Stakes and costs are mostly conceptual and communal rather than dramatized as real jeopardy, which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured. Still, cause-and-effect holds and the ending meaningfully reweights the opening situation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: pulses → visions → quake → canyon seam → final departure trace a legible progression in experiential depth and cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—choosing pathways over trophies, accepting fragmentation of the mirror/self—with the cost of being “rearranged” and relinquishing old defenses. Causality works on the chosen poetic-physics terms; each technical choice (calibration, pulses) leads to the next deepening rather than feeling random. The only limiting factor is that external stakes remain low-key, keeping the change mostly internal and conceptual rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the ledger → grotto → crowns → safes → final corridor → return, all framed by the one-hour gravity inversion, yields a clear before/after. Causality operates mostly in a symbolic, rule-consistent way (attention as currency opens vaults; the doodle’s instruction shapes tactic; the time limit forces an exit), but the links are legible. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the archivist exits with internal “safes reopened” and a breathing map, and the city’s locks now behave differently, at conceptual cost to their old function. The only thing keeping this just below 9 is that the emotional and practical price of what is relinquished by leaving the grotto when “hour is almost done” is more implied than sharply crystallized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, coherently building from arrival to instrument construction to the discovery that the grove wants a pulse, not a symphony. Causality within that mode is clean: each physical act (taking the insulator, uncovering the sculpture, threading roots, strumming) deepens the relationship and leads to the final choice to leave the pulse behind. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world remains quiet but no longer silent, and the insulator-as-promise gives a tangible before/after. The cost is present but gentle—foregoing virtuosity for companionship—so the arc is strong rather than breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very clear: walking into the nexus, shared silent play, decoding the hum, performing the stone ritual, and then accepting the coming judgment. Causality holds under the lyric mode—each new motif (the covenant, the girl’s knight path, the hollow in the stone) concretely tightens the situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant is reinterpreted, exile is reframed, and the narrator’s stance about staying vs. leaving crystallizes with a felt price. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are all legible early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: capture the town hush, attempt resonance with the clasp, achieve opening, read legacy, then respond by writing. Each phase causally follows the previous—silence collection primes the method that unlocks the diary, which in turn redefines the narrator’s task. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the work shifts from solitary eccentricity to an explicitly inherited promise with cost. Stakes are modest but unified, and there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: village unrest → arrival of seed/grandmother’s message → risky planting → overwhelming bloom → council breathing through the stink. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the bridges steady and the protagonist’s role shifts. The cost of the choice (stench, social risk, confrontation with grief) is on the page, if somewhat underplayed. Orientation—who/where/what kind of world—is quick and stable despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a causal quest from lift-off through navigation, discovery, fusion, and return, all contained within a single inversion window. Orientation (who/where/what’s happening) is legible early despite the lyric mode, and the orchard/gravity rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she acquires and re-situates the “seed heart,” altering the orchard’s future and her role as its caretaker. The cost is conceptual and vocational rather than dramatic—no sharp sacrifice or foreclosed alternative—so the ending, while satisfying, isn’t maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain from investigation → mapping wind corridors → offsetting the approach → successful landing is clean and satisfying, with no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is slightly safer, but the ethic is to treat that as data, not triumph, and the final pocketing of chart and patch marks a clear before/after. Stakes (the hospital generator failing, the circling chopper) concretize the urgency of all the prior textural work. Cost is legible in the refusal to cheer and the insistence on “inventory what held and what almost failed,” which forecloses complacency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: arrival, preparation, synchronized strike, deepening sequence of tones and chisels, emergence of the “sculpted hush,” and a resonant exit. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: hush becomes a standard by which noise is measured, reweighting the opening premise about certifying wonder. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens—the bell and chisel actions consistently produce environmental and auroral responses. Cost is primarily conceptual (leaving the city’s economy of noise, altering the world’s baseline), which fits the mode but keeps the stakes more abstract than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine—failed guardian returns to the breach, reopens the seam via flute, revises his weaving method to repair what he broke—reads cleanly, with each move a because/therefore rather than and-then. Orientation is strong from the first lines: we know who, where, and why; the later transition to the lost market is legible and motivated by the flute’s behavior. Closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the seam knits clean, the market partially breathes again, and he leaves driftwood and an apology as an ongoing price. The only small limitation is that the village’s fate and the broader consequences stay off-page, keeping the radius tight but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is accumulative/lyric: the press work, the observatory, the couple’s commission, and the final confession all layer toward a single conceptual closure. Causality holds cleanly—helping the grieving couple with transposed empathy leads directly to the narrator’s self-scrutiny and the on-page confession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices her use of ambiguity and reorients her practice (leaving the halo fragment on the sill, setting the map into “salvaged future tense”). The cost—accepting responsibility for “editing” grief and relinquishing the comfort of ambiguity—is conceptually clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear: climb → encounter → ritual corridor → thinning and aftermath, with no orientation debt and a stable lens of textural escalation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he recommits to his role “across the fade from memory to myth,” accepting both his mentor’s absence and the cost-limited nature of miracles. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent—each step in the ritual follows from his trade, tools, and the ridgeway’s properties. The emotional cost of transience is legible in the waning corridor and the solitary final listening, satisfying the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: trailhead → frost-reading → arbor/prism amplification builds in clear, sequential beats with no dead air. The dominant drive lens is accumulative/textural with light causality, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Mara’s belief and self-understanding shift and the mystic reasserts their credo. Cost is legible when Mara involuntarily speaks the name she “swore she would not say again” and then walks away “more ready to carry what she had been trying to drop.” The only small brake on a higher score is that the external situation remains low-intensity; the design relies almost entirely on interior and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: establishing isolation and the loom, introducing the puzzle edges and amber, then building to the sending and the brother’s reception. Causality holds within the lyric logic—her weaving choices lead to the fabric’s departure and the felt reply. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration when the loom empties, the debt is “paid in quiet,” and she buries the borders. The only restraint on going higher is that escalation feels like a steady swell rather than a distinctly sharpened inflection point.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The three-night structure is clean and legible, with each night escalating the plan (mapping, threading silk, bargaining in the storm) and culminating in the arches settling and rubble becoming usable. Causality is clear under a Hybrid/accumulative lens: ritual preparation plus honest vows → stone’s response → town’s ability to rebuild. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s stance toward the town has changed and the community now lives by Iven’s methods. There are no orientation debts or rule-breaking conveniences, though resistance from the stone is relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: return to the bay → use the shard to interrogate records → discover her childhood act across universes → reprice that knowledge into a new mapping mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts culpability as part of her cartographic practice rather than seeking erasure, with a clear before/after in how the shard and bay function for her. Parallel universes are handled legibly as variations on a single charged moment, and the mother’s silent choice in one strand retroactively clarifies the lifelong “withheld truth.” A touch more concrete sense of consequences (bodies, losses, or specific “people who survived by accident”) would make the stakes feel less abstract and push this toward a full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: lamp dies mid-storm → improvised candle/sea glass ritual → intensified reliance on letters/stones → skipper’s early arrival and exchange → dawn and the final thank-you offering. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: safety is conceptually repriced as shared ache rather than absence of danger, with cost visible in the keeper’s solitude and vigilance. No orientation debt: lighthouse, island, letter system, and timeline (night through dawn) are legible early. The final act of leaving “five stones where waves could almost reach them” crystallizes an ongoing, costly commitment rather than a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early and maintains it, moving from solitary keeper to prophetic jokes, to the storm-dialogue, to the arrival and training of the child, and finally to their joint “newsroom of two.” Causality is soft but coherent: accidental prophecy → social recognition → assignment to the tower → prophetic crate-child → shared vocation, with no major breaks. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: “weathered joy” and the lighthouse’s “emerald vow to tomorrow” reprice the initial premise of post-print isolation into an ongoing act of publication in light and weather. There’s no sharp inciting incident or single pivot, but for this lyric mode the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: receiving the donor heart → experimenting with light and the wing → live test with customers → protective intervention → articulated understanding. Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens, with each experiment informing the next posture shift rather than discrete plot turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator accepts an ongoing role as keeper of stories, with the donor heart now integrated and directional (“aligning like a compass”). Stakes and cost remain primarily conceptual and emotional, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/textural arc: solitary maintenance → odd instrument → hush and pin → descent and root → hidden archive → reading and logging → reconfiguration at dawn. Causality holds under the chosen lens: the sextant’s odd behavior and the tower’s hush lead directly to the root scene, excavation, and discovery of the tags; each beat narrows the emotional question of how to live with grief and what trees witness. Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: “measured grief will float” is dramatized through the tags, the healed sextant, and the final image of trees whose quiet now has a “register,” with the cost being the narrator’s decision to carry and catalogue others’ sorrows. Structure is single-POV, spatially coherent, and temporally continuous; no set-up is left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine: discovering the ledger’s requirement → realizing mornings are impossible → deciding to weave dawn from communities and mirror-world cooperation → communities joining to extend the loom’s use. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the realm is partially rekindled, the window becomes a covenant, and the narrator’s role and cost (sharing scars, loosening individual grip) crystallize on the page. Cause-and-effect is legible and there are no orientation issues; the mirror-world twin and the rule about weaving across both sides are introduced in time to pay off. The only limit is that the progression from high risk (“rekindle a dying realm”) to successful dawn feels relatively unresisted, with little sense that failure remains a live option late.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the mistake → shame → invitation → library encounter → joint reading → reconfigured understanding. The magical coincidence of the friend’s presence is thematically motivated and fits the accumulative/lyric design rather than feeling like a cheat. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance toward their mistake and toward staying/leaving is reweighted, with the cost of not restoring the old friendship form on the page. Structure is tight—one primary present-day arc framed by a single, well-controlled backstory mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walk to courtyard → uncover tea house → ritual with bread and tea → visitation by cashier → shared planting and future commitment. Causality is soft but coherent (ritual hospitality invites the witness), and the drive lens stays textural throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance shifts from belated, guilty witness to ongoing caretaker, with the cost of unending, “necessarily tenuous” labor made explicit. The before/after line is legible in “I was late, but I am here now” and the decision to return with tools and a “better map of sunlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: a normal state of cataloging vows, an inciting anomaly (the fractured pledge), discovery of the second slide, followed by a directive and the culminating self-vow. Causality is clear under a textural lens—each strange event deepens pressure rather than feeling random. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist becomes both entry and keeper, reconfiguring the library’s fate with visible conceptual cost. A slightly clearer articulation of what happens to the world if the directive is refused could push stakes and structure into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is tight: Lark enters with a clear goal, applies “false starts” to strain loyalties, a theft attempt catalyzes the lime spill, which precipitates the silent accusation and the recorded fracture of trust. Causality is clean despite the lyricism, and the truce of hush functions as a structural rule, not mere flavor. Closure lands in the image of her carrying the sound home, with a clear before/after in what she has gained and what it cost morally. Stakes remain intimate rather than life-and-death, but for this frame they are scaled and resolved appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: arrival on the bluff → encounter with Mirelle → walk through the election → weather’s “restraint over spectacle” → conceptual revaluation at the end. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each step builds meaning rather than ticking plot boxes. Closure is strong as a Conceptual Repricing: the compass’s “north” becomes “us,” and the skeptic commits to being carried by the story when “the taste of alone returns.” Stakes stay mostly conceptual, with little sense of what would concretely be lost by refusal, which keeps this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean and coherent: present-tense descent from the boardwalk into the cave, interwoven with compact backstory, leading causally to the lock problem and its resolution. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural bias—sensory patterning and motifs (laughter, harbor painting, charcoal) escalate toward a decisive act. Closure lands clearly: opening the box and “uncorking” the jar produces both a tangible change (access to the old work, a new plan of action) and a resonant reconfiguration of how the narrator will relate to their calling going forward. Cost is legible in the acceptance that the safe, singular identity of “portrait seller” is gone, replaced by a dual obligation that will demand ongoing risk and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the suspicious lie → hidden map → decoding → secret archive → boycott → public confrontation → joint opening of the vault. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the city moves from sequestering candor to re-releasing it with a new social contract, and her leverage (withheld work) is the hinge. Costs are legible—the risk of social unrest, broken reputations, and her own livelihood and status—and the final image reweights everything that came before. Structure is linear and legible despite lyricism, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: we move from establishing Iri and her practice, to the Keepers’ arrival, to a charged ritual encounter, to a quiet but decisive parting. Causality reads as accumulative rather than strictly linear—each detail (ledger, shard, sculptures) pays off in the central musical event and the Keepers’ changed departure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they leave without the shard but with altered stance, and she recommits to her post with visible cost. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, but the throughline never wavers, and there are no orientation or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: magnetic north shifts → system malfunction and roses’ runaway thirst → search for a solution framed by the manual → use of the child’s tin to stage a controlled burn → recalibration and internal revaluation. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never lost despite the lyricism. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the caretaker’s role and compass are conceptually repriced, with the risk and outcome of the burn giving the ending real weight. The accumulative texture supports rather than obscures that through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: listening to stories tightens around the mailbox mystery until communal attention and the narrator’s use of the locket/hairpin unlock it. The closure—discovering Noemi’s letters and reclassifying the box as an “open library” and “counterpractice”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (choosing mutual aid and slowness over commodification and spectacle). The gentrification pressure, while more atmospheric than plot-driving, still frames the stakes and is folded back in at the end (“Later the vans would return”). Causality holds throughout, with no orientation debt or late rule-changes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is coherent: they return to the lab with a clear goal, deploy the dice/dance/journal method to subvert the Warden’s grammar, and the key “question” unlocks the vent and cabinets, freeing the journals and voices. The piece runs on a Hybrid lens (lyric-accumulative texture plus a decisive causal turn at the end) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: before/after is legible once doubt opens a vent “none of its seals had named.” Cost is mostly conceptual and atmospheric—risk of Warden detection and the weight of the names—rather than dramatized as near-failure or loss. Structure is otherwise clean and single-scene, with no orientation or time-line confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: whale → gravity anomalies/memory loss → chemist/salt logic → excavation → corridor → retrieval → reframed vocation. Causality works under a fabulist logic but is consistent, and each step is a “because/therefore” from the last, not a random collage. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role as lantern lighter is conceptually repriced as keeper of paths through change, with the cost of holding and returning memories made legible. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities; the piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-ritual arc with accumulative logic: arrive at the brook → deploy the wing → confront the resistant code → locate and loosen the “seam” → exit with a reconfigured future. Causality is coherent within the lyric-magic frame, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is taught early and held through closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the prophecy’s path is altered, the brook and night are conceptually changed (“like water after stone is lifted”), and the future has “room” again. The main softness is that cost is more implied than sharply dramatized, keeping this shy of a 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is tight: sugar → weekly lessons → rooftop ritual → seal transfer forms a clear progression under a textural/lyric lens. Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing when the building finally “speaks” and the narrator’s role reconfigures from curious tenant to custodian of “respectfully held illusions.” Causality is soft but coherent—each step follows logically from the last—and there are no orientation issues despite the compressed timespan. The cost (carrying the seal’s responsibility and the injunction “do not be cruel with truth”) is evident, though left mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival → ritual with shell/fountain → negotiation → transfer → aftermath, with each step causally linked. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator becomes the new archive of winter, freeing the garden—is firmly on the page with a clear before/after. Cost is legible: she must carry an alien, precise cold and a solemn duty to “speak winter when needed and silence when not.” No orientation or lens ambiguity; the ritual frame and caretaker lore unify the movement.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → key/case opened → reading the unfinished work → decision to forgive rather than complete → ritual exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the choice to leave the margin blank and plant the thorn forecloses punitive completion in favor of patient mercy, with the cost of remaining “unlinked from power.” Causality is soft but coherent and appropriate to lyric mode; each move arises from the last. Stakes and change are legible, though the external consequences remain mostly implied rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: arrival at the nexus, experimental questioning, shell-assisted revelation, then re-framing through the mother and final promise. Causality under the textural lens holds—each move (asking questions, using the shell, singing the pot song) logically deepens knowledge rather than randomly associating. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rules of echo/obligation are reinterpreted, with cost in Lio’s recognition of past absences and their new self-imposed duty. Orientation (who/where/what the nexus is) is clear early, with no disorienting jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a largely causal lens, the chain from dreams → decoding the taps → dive → recovery of the globe → communal listening → exposure of the company is coherent and inevitability-building. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: justice surfaces and the world’s moral alignment subtly shifts while the dead can rest, with clear cost in communal shame and grief. The piece teaches its mosaic/lyric pattern early and maintains orientation and stakes throughout. The only arguable softness is the off-page handling of formal consequences, but the story’s chosen scale (moral exposure, not legal process) feels fully satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: preparation → gathering → shared ritual → reconfigured outlook. Closure lands cleanly when the town begins mending (drying stones, wiping moss) and the whisk is passed to the child, a clear conceptual repricing of “effort’s invisibility.” Causality is soft but coherent—each step emerges organically from the last, with no orientation issues. The only weakness is that the pressure curve is gentle enough that the final turn feels like a deepening rather than a sharp decisive change, keeping this below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clear: arrival → observation of the anomaly → discovery of the shredder → reconstruction of letters → decoding the resonator → reorientation of the caretakers → tested storm. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the “curse” becomes calibration, and the narrator leaves having shifted the system from myth to maintenance. Stakes (survival of the orchard and intellectual honesty) are coherent and touched again at the ending storm. The only thing holding this just below 9 is that the personal cost is mostly conceptual/ideological, not sharply dramatized in a single high-friction decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: solitary weatherwork → Brin’s arrival → town’s intervention → emergence of the prophet-pattern → reconfigured town allegiance. Causality is lyric but legible (radio predicts Brin, gives instructions, then reveals the “child”; the town responds to visible miracles). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town “listened differently” and allegiance “locked” into a new pattern, with conceptual cost implied in the coming revolution. The main limitation is that the price of this shift (social, personal, or material) remains mostly suggested rather than concretely felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is accumulative but clearly causal: jars → widow’s music box → trapped note → village ritual → redefined vocation. Closure is strong and on the page, with a felt before/after in how the village relates to sound and memory and how the narrator understands his trade. Cost is present in the implied self-erasure of his role once the village “cups its own palms.” The only small limit is that pressure and options never feel sharply narrowed; the piece moves more by deepening pattern than by concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean: Marek arrives to protect the artifact, prepares by tuning to the stone, confronts the seeker, and uses sonic absolution to reconfigure her goal into collaboration. The piece maintains a single coherent scene with one clear tightening when the seeker arrives and is exposed to the stone. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they become “two keepers without malice,” with the cost of Marek’s shared responsibility and the seeker’s renunciation of leverage. Stakes resolve a bit gently given the setup, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is linear and accumulative: lake → viaduct assignment → messenger’s arrival → communal teaching, all cohering under a textural/accumulative drive lens. Causality is soft but legible—each phase arises plausibly from the last, and there is a clear closure unit when the “patient revolution” shifts from idea to on-page communal practice. Stakes remain mostly conceptual (how to meet change and fear), and while that fits the mode, a slightly sharper sense of what might be lost if the teaching fails would deepen the arc. Orientation is excellent from the outset (frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, role), with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is tight and accumulative: the investigation proceeds from physical observation (salt-locked drains, lantern refueling) through the lantern-mediated memory experience to a decisive reporting choice. Causality is clean under an accumulative/textural lens—each observation deepens pressure until rejecting the algorithm’s framing becomes the only honest option. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: she commits to a report that will cause institutional friction and to carrying the lantern as living use rather than evidence. The before/after—being guided by “the algorithm” vs. claiming responsibility—is legible and costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean: chaplain → broken heart → repair shop → repaired heart → return to Jonah, with each step reweighting his approach. Structure as two main shards (shop, then prison) is legible and well-paced, and the closure—Jonah breathing with the ticking, apology becoming a map—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The stakes (how to live post-harm) remain intimate but consequential and are not undercut by coincidence or soft resets. A slightly clearer on-page sense of the parole hearing’s imminence could tighten temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: repeated attempts and refinements of the algorithm and kaleidoscope work build to the arrow’s twitch and the bell’s conceptual “beginning.” Causality is coherent—each adjustment (re-tuning to “hunger,” letting the algorithm choose speed) logically precedes the final resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell is now ringable on demand, and the workshop/world subtly shift in response. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual, but they are legible and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: cold case → numeric pattern → lie to gain access → discovery of the Sink → ethical choice to surface Aida’s files. The structure is mostly summary, but the key turn (the lie) and the closure beat (posting Driftwood) are clear and motivated. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator redefines their role from memory keeper within policy to active resistor of erasure. The main limitation is that consequences of the final act are only implied, leaving the cost more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: dispute → relic/shard → trip to vintage store → mirror-mediated reconstruction → return and proposal → charged gathering and decision to stay. Structure is essentially two shards (town/mirrors and orchard assembly) that cohere under a situational/accumulative lens, and the ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she commits to an ongoing, embodied peacekeeping practice instead of a one-off verdict. Cost is legible (she binds herself to the town and to a slow, labor-intensive process), though the emotional and practical price could be more sharply dramatized on the page. All major set-ups (shard, mirrors, child’s death, floes) pay off without loose threads or retroactive rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a tight accumulative mosaic: recurring beats of listening, clinic work, Erland’s rope wisdom, and storms all layer into a single throughline of how the narrator relates to endings. Causality is soft but coherent — learning to sound ice and read pressures leads to the child’s rescue, the storm preparation, and finally to the authority to delay their own euthanasia. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the appointment remains, but the narrator has reconfigured its meaning, choosing to live in the ongoing tension of “margin of mercy.” Cost is legible in the refusal to take the clean, scheduled exit they once pursued.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene structure is clean: bus station → pavilion encounter → revelation of letter/map → knife/twine choice → rewritten terms, all under a steady accumulative pressure. Causality is soft but coherent: the found fragment leads to recognition, which forces a decision about how to proceed with the relationship. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a new, conditional future (meeting where “rivers kiss the rows”) replaces the obliterating impulse of burning the letter, with cost legible in what’s relinquished. The situational/accumulative drive lens is held consistently through to the charged, quiet final image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative, ritual-day structure is clean: consecration, first clearing, rising wind, stitching calm, widening the clearing, quiet closure, with clear because/therefore links under a textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance toward attention (“letting-go of the need to look straight”) and their ongoing duty is reweighted with cost (endless repetition “because the valley forgets quickly”). Stakes remain legible but quiet, and while pressure is consistent, the final shift is more tonal and conceptual than decisively narrowing options, keeping this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean accumulative ritual: arrival, setup with case/photos, circle of stories, mirror reveal, corridor test-walk, final words and departure. Causality is soft but legible—each step of the ritual arises from the last and moves the town from frozen grief toward tentative cohesion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town now has a lived map and the narrator commits to returning; the “less fractured chest” and memorizing the path with their feet mark a clear before/after. Stakes and costs are subtle, so the emotional turn is more textured than sharply decisive, keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure (Sprout → Scar → Orchard, building toward the noon testimony) is coherent and purposeful under a textural drive lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: decoding growth becomes synonymous with forgiveness and allowing language to outlive one’s ownership (“to let language breathe long enough to become someone else's discovery”). Causality is soft but consistent: each card and sound refines his stance and prepares the evidence he will carry. The cost is quieter and more implied than dramatized, but the before/after of his relationship to growth and testimony is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece works on an accumulative/textural drive: repeated listening attempts, chalk markings, and driftwood reconfigure into a coherent closure image of the statues “remembering for him.” Causality is lyric but consistent: his forgetfulness → need for markers → following the rearranged arrows → encounter with the toppled head and echo. Stakes and pattern tighten once the tide lifts and the driftwood “hands of a clock” begin to move, pushing him toward a culminating listening act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he accepts that memory will be outsourced to place and object—with a subtle but legible cost in his relinquishing of control over his own future recall.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: quake → misalignment → painstaking restructuring → sharpened image → detected lunar tremor → reconceived understanding of instruments and Moon. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: noise becomes voice, the spinning chronometer becomes a wave-marker, and the observatory’s mission is subtly redefined. Causality is intact (the quake leads to pier shift and chronometer behavior, prompting the repair sequence), and the ending shows visible cost in the form of relinquished certainty and habitual stubbornness. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and professional rather than viscerally dramatic, which slightly limits impact but fits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: prognosis → request for music → therapist’s choice to call the son → bedside reunion → death with shard-transfer as final act. Structure is linear and contained to one continuous scene, with reflection anchored tightly to present stimuli (the shard, the clementine). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the father dies, the shard and the responsibility to “be careful with joy” pass to the son, and the narrator fulfills her aim of facilitating a real goodbye. The cost—of time running out, of long-held silence breaking only at the brink—is legible and emotionally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → key → ascent → ritual with mirrors → inward noon → contract and exit form a clean escalation toward conceptual closure. Causality is legible even in the lyric mode; each step grows plausibly from the last, with no dropped set-ups. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing—“where shadows go at noon” is answered in a way that reweights nearly every prior image. The cost is implied more than dramatized, though, so the decisive change is slightly more intellectual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: substitute body → secret door → tooth → Ari’s appearance and confession → decision about the story, all within one contiguous night. The drive lens reads Hybrid but closes causally: each discovery tightens options, culminating in the narrator’s choice to align with Ari and reframe the town’s narrative. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—“turn mistakes into constellations”—with on-page cost in the risk of facing the town’s clamor and the relinquishing of simple blame. Backstory is tightly anchored to present stimuli (tooth, map) and always tilts the current stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: grotto work → backstory of fire and brother → ascent and unveiling in village → imagined future of his return. Causality is clean under a textural lens: each stage deepens the same drive without needless detours, and the closure (reweighting “safer” vs “patient”) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Stakes and cost are quiet but legible—the foreclosed path of flame-based beacons and the life anchored to shore. There are no orientation or lens-ambiguity issues, and the reflective passage is anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: viral confession → narrator’s refusal to engage online → deliberate mapping and waiting → confrontation and shared burial of the pendant, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new detail (the icicle pattern, the pendant, the confession content) tightens the emotional frame rather than digressing. The closure beat—burying the pendant but leaving the chain exposed, coupled with their mutual vows—articulates a clear before/after in the relationship and in how their story will be told. Stakes (how they will narrate and treat each other going forward) are resolved on the page without summary or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: approach → wading into the contrary river → receiving emblems → crystallizing the pact and choice, and this pattern holds cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the narrator chooses the river’s refusal and redefines their task as “arranging permission,” with the market path implicitly foreclosed. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode—each apparition and emblem grows logically from the declared intention and the opened “pocket of visibility.” The cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, slightly softening the impact but not breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → ritual under the harvest moon → afterglow, with each beat deepening the same central drive (restoration of rites). Causality is lyric but legible: forgotten practices → environmental malaise → Rowen’s arrival with a method → communal participation → visible repair (bowls mending, wells and fields responding). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the village’s stance toward ritual and repair is reweighted, and the final exchange of hum/answer makes the before/after sharply felt. The cost—surrendering convenience for attentive, ongoing practice—registers conceptually, though it’s not sharpened into a single difficult trade-off on the page, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: listening in the orchard → assembling patterns → deriving the map → crossing to the lake → sealing the fissure, each step a clear “therefore” or “so that.” Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong with the world) is firmly in place early without clunky exposition. Closure lands decisively when the sealing act restores motion to lake and aurora, reconfiguring a world in suspended breath with a visible conceptual and resource cost. No major causality gaps or unkept setups undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: mapping light, repairing the timer, testing the bell, and bottling echoes all layer toward a conceptual closure where jars of stored resonance and a timer left behind redefine the initial project. Causality is clean within the lyric frame—each technical step clearly enables the next, and the final state (a cellar of wonder, a cave that keeps his laugh) logically arises from his process. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the agreement with the stone and his decision to leave keys where they “learn” mark a before/after in his stance with a quiet but real cost (relinquishing control, accepting partial self-forgetting). Stakes remain contemplative rather than urgent, which slightly limits structural intensity even as the arc itself is impeccably coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the procession of burdens functions as a clear structural spine, each test building toward the decisive weighing of the narrator’s own fear. Causality is legible and local (“by orienting properly” → burdens yield → method applied to progressively knottier griefs). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator exits with a changed relationship to burden and vocation, framed by the city’s hush turning to song. The cost—accepting ongoing duty rather than escape—is on the page and reshapes the initial vow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative, single-morning structure is tight: kettle as clock, carving as through-line, and rain as evolving counterpoint build toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis. Closure lands cleanly when she decides not to restore the name and then opens the window, holding the carved collar, tin, and kettle “like a new ring”—a before/after stance toward grief is legible with cost. Causality is quiet but coherent: each step (knot, whistle, prayer for a “hinge”) leads naturally to the final act without soft resets or unmotivated turns. Orientation is impeccable from the first sentence, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, lyric structure early and sustains it: carousel → ascent → lagoon → negotiation → new stance. Causality is coherent at a conceptual level (wind-ladders via stories → reach lagoon → use camera wheel to negotiate → change habits), and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator chooses to stay and treat breath as craft. The cost—relinquishing old running/plundering patterns—is legible in “I stay, though the wind-ladders groan, though the carousel bones call me back.” The only limiting factor is that some transitions operate more on metaphorical logic than concrete cause, which may slightly blur stakes for a general reader.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative-causal: diagnose dysfunctional flows → experiment with rerouting → incorporate janitor’s needs → partial reopening for real people. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the terminal shifts from “dead” to a breathing, repurposed shelter, and the narrator’s stance on hope crystallizes into maintenance. Costs are implied (ongoing labor, responsibility, the scale of the task) but not strongly dramatized as loss or tradeoff on the page. For a top-tier venue, one sharper moment of risk or sacrifice would deepen the before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: sanctuary entry → vow to listen only → forecourt listening/apology → return to clocks, culminating in a conceptual repricing of what it means to “abandon” a dream. Causality is subtle but coherent: his choice not to write clocks today leads to the encounter with the finch and the apology, which in turn unlocks the new stance at the end. Closure lands clearly with the redefinition of the dream as weather he will walk beside, carrying evident emotional cost. The only restraint on a higher score is the very gentle, near-frictionless progression—there’s no strong structural kink or surprise beyond deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: legend → nighttime approach → retrieval of the box → revelation → confrontation with the engineer → joint departure toward change. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the protagonist shifts from solitary legend seeker to collaborator, reweighing both past and future options. The cost is largely conceptual (family complicity, civic betrayal, danger implied) rather than enacted, which slightly softens the impact. Structure is otherwise tight and well-contained within one continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival on the dock → listening/decoding → resistant splice revelation → seed test → fisherman’s return, all under one continuous night. Causality is coherent within a lyric, textural lens: each new knot read or memory unlocked deepens the stakes around preservation and trust rather than moving plot by big external turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in the final shared listening (“we listened to the harbor keeping us”), with the cost implied in the night’s vigil and the burden of stewardship. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, which suits the mode but slightly limits the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is very clear: set-up of profession and place → arrival of client → ritual with the thread → projected meeting with the man → written obituary → gifting of the thread. Causality holds under a textural lens: each move arises naturally from the premise and steadily reweights the central absence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to his “absence” is redefined into a “breathing space,” with cost visible in her tears and the new way she’ll move through her house. Nothing crucial is left off-stage or unearned, and the final image cleanly seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rescuing the egg → devising the cradle in dialogue with the palace’s tremors → the storm-night hatching → the political/emotional reorientation at the end. Causality is legible under a lyric, slightly elliptical lens: the cradle’s tuning to stalactites and chains plausibly enables the hatching and reconfiguration. Closure lands with both an external shift (mills slowing, palace opened to vines, Dawnspoke transforming murals) and an internal one (the prince’s repudiation of conquest), with felt cost in relinquishing inherited scripts. The only thing keeping this short of exceptional is the relative smoothness of the path—there is little structural friction or reversal beyond waiting for the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: walk to lagoon → ritual with coin and sand → encounter with boy → grafting → return to station, with each beat reweighting the central question. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: her choice to come off-duty for the lagoon creates the situation where she can both test herself and guide the boy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the final image of her as “the opposite of a fuse” makes the before/after palpable with the cost of her history still present. Stakes remain mostly internal and quiet, so the turns are subtle rather than sharply decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure (breadcrumbs → first voice → plaza → broker → partial restoration) coheres under a textural/accumulative lens and culminates in a clear reconfiguration: the city shifting from forgetfulness toward active, patient remembering. Each step arises logically from the previous image or instruction, and closure is legible in “until rain” as an earned stasis with ongoing cost. The geese-timeframe provides a soft clock that pays off at the midpoint and near the end. The piece stays within its chosen scale; there are no causality breaks, though pressure remains more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: tending, visitors’ arrival, demonstration, and departure deepen a single throughline rather than hinge on sharp reversals. Causality is coherent—the no-fire ethic forces the use of sonar and petals; that method then reconfigures the travelers’ relationship to light. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the garden’s method propagates outward via “lamps made of stored resonance,” and the narrator recommits to the practice with a clarified sense of cost and lineage. Stakes are primarily conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the impact for elite-market readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is accumulative and very controlled: nightly returns, butterfly migration, and recurring visits from the father and the spectral mother build a clear pattern. The closure—finishing the daughter’s stone with “a single spare curve” as the butterflies depart—functions as a resonant reconfiguration, reweighting the entire practice of carving as mapping collective grief. Causality in an accumulative sense is tight: apprenticeship → ribbon → father’s selection → evolving mentorship → final kite image; nothing feels arbitrary. Cost is legible in the “quilt I could not finish” and the choice to keep working under that endlessness, making the before/after of her understanding of grief and movement clear.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climbing to stop the clock, stretching the pendulum’s pause for adjustments and reckoning, then resuming time and immediately enacting a new ethic with the fisherman. Causality under a textural lens holds: storms and past rigidity → need to realign tower and ridge → ritualized adjustments in the pause → social repair on the ridge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward time and neighbors shifts and costs him the comfort of pure exactitude while not erasing his guilt (“never finished”). The before/after is legible and priced, with the resumed swing and mutual carving as clear on-page markers.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: wait for the chess clock, read the tapestry, discover the missing grave, investigate the asters, then the poplar, and reframe the burial lie. The accumulative/lyric pattern is taught early and sustained, and the closure—a reconfigured understanding of the widow’s intentions plus his choice to mark and later plant poppies—is legible with conceptual cost. Some steps (e.g., the quick leap from tapestry to two perfectly located sacks) feel a touch convenient, but they don’t break the underlying logic or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: orientation in the spire, laying out models, considering three possible archives, then narrowing to the canal-with-hinges design. Each step logically follows from prior reflection and modeling, and the kingfisher beat reweights the decision without feeling like a deus ex machina. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the narrator, now conceptually resolved, lifts the quill with an ethic (“prevail without vanquishing”) that costs them the comfort of purity or spectacle. The stakes and price are more intellectual-ethical than visceral, which slightly limits impact at an elite-competition level.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is tight: living in the alcove → searching for the rumored signal → contact with the pirate broadcast → lessons in dust-grammar → the request for payment and the vow, culminating in an earned stillness. Causality is coherent under a textural drive lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she becomes a conductor of dust-stories with a new internal “cadence marker.” Stakes and costs are conceptual rather than dramatic, but they are legible and grounded in concrete beats like hiding the radio and promising ongoing labor.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: home → preparation → exhibition → chair’s autonomous rocking, all linked by the drive to stage the “mirage of safety.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when mother and narrator stand under the skylight and the chair’s old rhythm repeats, making survival “without a witness” newly costly and newly answered. Every major element set up early (letters, mask, chair, incomplete information) pays off in the gallery sequence without stray threads. The causal spine is subtle but sound, and the ending’s cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal throughline is strong: cog → factions’ demand → looming noon flood → leveraging the cog to move them → using it to fix the gate. Reflection on past rescues is well-integrated and clearly anchored in present stimuli, and it justifies the protagonist’s confidence and methods. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: averted disaster, dampened narratives, and the cog retained as a working method rather than a symbol. There are no meaningful orientation or lens issues; the causal drive and the conceptual repricing of “rebellion” cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly linear and accumulative: wary arrival → experimental rehearsals → rosette-mediated soft turn → public performance that crystallizes the change. The chosen drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, with pattern-building around listening, silence, and “subtracting noise.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s stance toward each other and the art is subtly but decisively altered, with cost implied in the long labor of “unlearning hatred.” Escalation is intentionally quiet rather than sharply plotted, but the final performance and shared silence clearly function as a before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: entering the greenhouse → planting the seed → pruning/tasting → fruit → communal soup is a coherent progression. Causality is strong under the lyric mode—each action leads naturally to the next, and the ordinance/omen frame gives the act a mild outlaw charge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the neighborhood moves from passive trauma and prohibition to quietly rebuilding “with flavors, quietly and together,” with an implied social cost and risk. The only limitation is that the external risk from the council remains largely conceptual, so the cost is more thematic than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single causal arc from blackout to Mara’s arrival, to the test, ascent, calibration, and partial restoration of the city. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world restarts and the narrator recommits to his toll-keeping stance with a reweighted sense of purpose. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation debt despite the lyric style. The main weakness is the relative softness of cost—almost everything goes right, and no serious alternative path is dramatized or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—three houses as variations on the central question—reads clear and purposeful under a textural drive lens. Each house encounter follows logically from the narrator’s method and motive, with the object-method (orris + displaced objects) giving continuity. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the final realization about “pauses, put-backs, almosts” reweights all prior visits with a clear before/after in understanding, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early, so there’s no disorienting drift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: reveal → descent → threading → ampoule break → shared waiting, with each move deepening the original “secret” rather than introducing new plotlines. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—the telepathy, water, eelgrass, and lattice all contribute to a clear ritual of re-informing the city and scholar. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the meaning of the garden’s “drowning” and hesitation is repriced, and the breach becomes a “listening wound.” The cost—accepting slowness and complexity over reassuring certainty—is conceptually strong, though not dramatized as a sharp, painful decision on the page, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tight: repeated climbs, dice rolls, chalk proofs, and recurring “Opportunities” build toward the rupture and the final decision to inhabit rather than escape the corridor. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator stops seeking exit and repurposes the staircase as a “remembering instrument,” with visible conceptual and emotional cost. Causality is coherent under the chosen mode—each image grows from the prior logic of regret-as-engine. The only limitation is that some transitions feel more associative than pressured, softening the sense of a single decisive structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense greenhouse frame, interwoven past offerings, then the neighbor’s arrival and the map as a clarifying beat. Causality holds under a textural lens: her ongoing project of painting kindness → city begins to answer → neighbor appears with proof and a way to continue. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the greenhouse refigured as a “small republic” and the project validated but still ongoing. The cost—years of insomnia and solitary faith—is implicit more than dramatized in the closing beat, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece runs as a mostly linear accumulative arc: arrival → discovery of crafts and lens → bread-ritual innovation → communal test at the waterfall → beekeeper truth → transfer of the lens. Causality is clean (bread softens wax; wax restores faces; ritual tests endurance; rumor is resolved by the stranger), and the global drive—preserving names and methods under erasure—holds steadily. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: history is redefined as something that must be eaten and re-enacted to endure, with the narrator bearing that charge forward. The only slight limitation is that the beekeeper revelation feels a bit conveniently timed, though it still coheres thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: arrival → descent → solving the yoyo → awakening the stone → vision of threads → choice to refuse the door, all in one continuous scene. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal frame with accumulative lyric texture), and closure lands clearly when the protagonist lets the yoyo climb and forecloses the transcendent option. Stakes and rules are internally consistent; each earlier element (counterclockwise craft, backward script, hunger stone) pays off at the climax. Cost is legible on the page as the loss of the long-sought escape from fate in favor of a grounded, risk-laden human tie.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal beneath the lyric surface: resuscitation → advisor’s plan → entry to funhouse → paradox dictionary trap → confrontation and capturing of fear → exit. Closure lands: fear’s weakness is exposed and used, and the narrator’s identity (“my name swam back into my face”) is reconfigured, giving a clear before/after. The cost is primarily conceptual (risk of erasure, being smeared into photos) rather than dramatized as a nearly-lost outcome, so the climax feels slightly low on jeopardy for the ambition of the premise. Orientation is strong from early on; the experimental texture never confuses the basic throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story tracks a coherent situation: predicted gale → escalating storm behavior → improvised musical defense → secondary hazard (knife net) → lull and reconfigured sky. Causality is clear within a lyric, Hybrid (causal/accumulative) frame, and each tactic grows plausibly from the prior one (reading cloud “D,” then droning the beam, then building the tower, then converting the net). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm has been reweighted into orchestra at the real risk of destruction, and the final quiet reading of clouds as “silence” makes a before/after legible. The main limitation is that the victory feels relatively assured once the pattern of musical transformation is established; there’s little sense of near-failure or genuine tactical constraint at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: city’s hunger and the rusted gate establish stakes, the found tag escalates, the ledger reframes the mother’s fate, and the lattice-reading triggers the watchers’ response. Causality is tight under a textural lens—each discovery (tag, ledger, pattern) directly enables the next move. Closure lands as a decisive act with conceptual and implied physical cost: she chooses to be measured, echoing her mother’s fate, rather than retreat to warn the city. The before/after in what “watching” means—and what it costs to ask—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the station → discovery of the ledger and scraps → recognition of “shipments” as people → re-evaluation of the stationmaster → decision on how to tell the story. Causality is coherent under a reflective, lyric lens, with each find reweighting the central question of truth vs. mercy. Closure lands as a conceptual and practical decision (publish the findings and methods; return ledger to families), clearly marking a before/after. Stakes remain mostly ethical/intellectual rather than materially tested, but they’re legible and scaled appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds a clear arc from entry to exit with a Charged Poise ending: he has done his day’s work, marked the depth, and left his final note for a future finder. Causality is coherent (drawbridge → access → exploration → note-placing → departure) and the dominant stake—bearing witness to absence—is sustained. The cost is conceptual and emotional (isolation, unrecognized labor, commitment to gaps over restoration) and lands in “I was here not to repair the past but to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer.” Escalation is more deepening than turning, but it suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story’s accumulative investigative structure is clean: obtain the stamp during the blackout, test stories, uncover evidence that the flood was engineered, and end on a reweighted understanding. Causality holds under a textural/causal hybrid lens—waiting for the generators to fail enables a different kind of reading, which enables the conceptual turn. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: the city shifts in her mind, and she chooses to hide the stamp, holding a new, heavier relationship to the archive. Because stakes are primarily epistemic, the cost is more conceptual than situational, but it is present.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: arrival → preparation (polishing, brewing visions) → making cranes → formal offering → partial release/loosening. Causality is consistent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each step in the ritual deepens his engagement with grief and sets up the final visitation of the shadow. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ache’s weight shifts rather than vanishing—and the cost of not fully regaining the shadow is legible on the page. The piece stays in one continuous temporal window with brief, well-anchored memory, avoiding orientation problems.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-tense observation aboard the observatory, interwoven with the trauma backstory, builds toward the discovery of the “basin” and the narrator’s charged decision to keep witnessing it. Causality is lyrical but legible: cooling breakers → anomalous readings → geode reaction → perturbation sequence → revealed basin → transmission to commander → personal vow, with the cost residing in her chosen, ongoing exposure to grief and “unfiltered awakening.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the world’s “unused might” is refigured as both lift and burden, and her stance toward it is fixed at a price. The piece stays structurally tight, though the external consequences of sending coordinates remain implied rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival → activation of dome/chip → discovery of blanks → reinterpretation of silence → tuned belonging, with each step legibly building on the prior. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: recognizing blanks as rests and tuning belonging reweights all earlier “missing pieces” with conceptual cost. Causality is more conceptual than event-driven but holds consistently under that lens, with no orientation debt. The only limiting factor is that the emotional and situational stakes never quite tighten into a hard on-page dilemma, even within a lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: past forgery to avoid scandal → present meeting out of guilt → joint return to the shore → discovery of true carvings and Abel’s act → confession and partial restitution. Structure is linear with one clear transition (terrace → beach → terrace) and closes on a resonant reconfiguration where their shared project (“publish the names”) is newly defined, with evident cost. Closure is strong—a decisive change in stance and future intent—without over-explaining. The only minor limitation is that the driftwood discovery skirts coincidence; it works thematically but leans a bit on fate rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous negotiation scene that tightens when the second trade snags on an old raid. Cause-and-effect is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens, with the narrator’s interventions directly resolving the rising tension. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the parapet “widens,” the mist thins, and the cooling metal reweights the fragile, costly peace. Stakes and costs (ongoing war, hunger, and the emotional toll on the negotiator) are clear without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: regret and self-exile lead to a modest, ritual outing, which is disrupted by the boy’s plea, leading to a guided rescue and internal reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early; the accumulative lyricism never muddies situational stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he ends with an earned stasis where sorrow is carried like a chart and heart/action share a shoreline. The because/therefore chain holds throughout without plot amnesia or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: procedure → pattern-reading via newspapers → descent to lake → test/confession → forked choice → decision to stay. Causality is strong (the method of reading the city leads to the rumor, which leads to the lake, which demands confession and then a vocational choice), and the closure beat is on-page and legible. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal journey plus accumulative imagery) but remains coherent, with the decisive change at “I chose to stay.” No major orientation debt or contrivance undercuts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative lyric structure is coherent: spices → beasts → treaty with soil → Mira’s emergence → metamorphosis decision form a clear progression. Closure lands on the page with cost: the narrator gives up plain speech and a prior identity to maintain the bond, and the revised fortune slip/sap reweights everything that came before. Causality is mythic rather than literal but consistent under the established rules, and the before/after of the narrator’s role is legible. A touch more explicit hinge on what would happen if the narrator refused could sharpen the structural stakes, but it’s implied strongly enough.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: climb → ritual setup → descent into the chamber of stalled seconds → confessional rite → ascent and renewed stance. Causality holds within the story’s magical logic (the crack traced onto the cards demands the pilgrimage, which enables the descent, which in turn enables the confessions). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts that lost time cannot be seized, only atoned for, and commits to “where to kneel when the next minute frays” with visible emotional cost. Orientation is strong from line one (“After the birth, I climbed to the midnight glade above clouds”), so the lyricism never muddies who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: orienting intro, approach via the tear-maps, inner calibration, then the lock test and the seed-library reveal. The closure beat—choosing to open only what can be tended and to remain as caretaker—is a resonant reconfiguration with evident cost (embraced solitude, bound duty). Causality is consistent under a textural lens, and there are no orientation gaps or late rule-changes that undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: Mara arrives, seeds coincidences, assembles an impromptu triad, escalates to a communal “practice,” and then the volcano’s gentle exhalation resolves the situational pressure. Causality is coherent despite the quasi-magical coincidence: jars draw people, people help place light, the town has a safe path and an organized response when the mountain moves. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the village has rehearsed a new, calmer relationship to eruption, and Mara has proven coincidence as “useful kindness” rather than spectacle. The only limit is that the on-page cost of success (what’s risked or lost beyond potential panic) is conceptually clear but emotionally soft.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: blackout → code-reading → descent to the workshops → reconfiguration of the fort’s power → confrontation with Rhun → new equilibrium. Closure is solid, with the fort’s role transformed and the narrator’s duty redefined; the “unexplained” blackout in the records vs. lived knowledge is a satisfying conceptual repricing. The main weakness is the relative ease of success: no attempt meaningfully fails or forces a new tactic, and Rhun’s opposition softens after minimal friction. Still, the throughline remains coherent and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: promise → search → meeting the herder → ritual with rocks and dust → opening the corridor → the rescue-swap decision. The piece maintains single-scene coherence with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and the world rules (no friction, dust, mathematical sequences) stay consistent and pay off at the door. Closure lands firmly with both a decisive change (the brother’s return) and a resonant reconfiguration (the narrator inheriting the herder’s role at real cost). Nothing crucial feels elided or conveniently solved off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: past inciting incident (envelope) → ascent → observatory encounter → revelation about the teacher → closing reconfiguration of self and city. Causality is intact, and the accumulative pattern of storm/clock/map converges elegantly at the moment when the scar path aligns with the poet’s own. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, with a credible conceptual and emotional cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with light causal skeleton) stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: waiting for a courier, decoding the sundial, the intrusion of Rook, the duel, and the decision to enter the revealed “gate” all follow a clear causal chain. The closure lands as a decisive change (they literally step into the constructed question) with conceptual cost, leaving the familiar world for an uncertain destination. The drive reads as Hybrid—causal moves within a highly patterned, textural frame—and that lens holds consistently. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (an “address of a door” more than a sharply defined consequence), which keeps this just shy of a 9-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: they arrive at the rusted library, declare their intent, gather people, reveal and use the map, and end on a charged completion/hand-off of the space. Causality is coherent under a textural/accumulative lens, with pennies → map → gathering neighbors → rebuilding as a meaningful tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library shifts from dying relic to breathing node of resistance, with the cost implied in demolition threats and the narrator’s unstable selfhood. The only softness is that external opposition (demolition, authorities) remains offstage, so structural pressure never has to pivot around an overt blow.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: misdelivered film → portal → arbor → performance as wager → timetable disruption → return to a slightly reconfigured station world. The accumulative/lyric structure is taught early and holds, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he has proven timetables can be bent without apocalypse. Cost is present but subtle—risking the last train, leaving his post, straining against “clockwork”—so the stakes feel moral/metaphysical rather than concrete. Orientation is strong throughout, with no confusing temporal or spatial jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight and legible: early mission and monsoon deadline, middle discovery via shared dreams, and final act of planting that triggers a reconfigured status quo. Causality within the lyric frame is consistent—dreams → ridge saddle → ear-shaped hollow → successful planting—and the monsoon’s delayed arrival underscores closure rather than feeling convenient. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: authority and memory move from being curated by the narrator to being co-held by the island, the new tree, and the community, with the conceptual cost of no longer being uniquely necessary. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and stays stable despite the high metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the walk around the islet, guided by compass and lace, builds cleanly toward the cove confrontation and spoken apologies. Causality is lyrical but coherent: lace→instructions→coast walk→cove→speaking→shift in teaching stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (accepting regret and relinquishing rigid control), and the “before/after” is legible. No orientation or lens-clarity issues interfere with the ending.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, building texture until the pivotal examination of the butterfly dust triggers a Conceptual Repricing of her research. Closure is resonant, reconfiguring her approach to both the greenhouse and the stars ("recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal"). The summary beat with the neighbors handles time compression smoothly without breaking the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure—choosing to anneal the evidence into art—is a strong, character-specific Charged Poise that satisfies the premise. However, the investigative mechanism relies on a convenient "soft magic" (frost patterns literally revealing financial debts) that feels unearned by the established rules, acting as a shortcut to bypass the difficulty of proof.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The piece functions as an atmospheric vignette or portrait rather than a narrative with causal drive. While the "day in the life" structure is legible, the lack of present-tense obstacles or decisive changes results in a static trajectory. The closure is a form of Earned Stasis ("permission to continue"), but because the cost was paid entirely in the backstory (the ferry), the ending lacks immediate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent surreal logic where the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the distress signal—lands with significant conceptual weight. While the discovery of the specific manual ("Manual for Beacon Keepers") via the lens feels slightly convenient as a plot device, the subsequent action and the refusal to yield to the storm firmly ground the resolution in protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("Soon the ring meant...", "One night...") to span the season, which dilutes immediate scene tension. The resolution is driven by the passage of time (spring arriving) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's actions in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic sequence (set up, apply tear, breathe, resolve) lacking causal friction or obstacles. Closure relies on a "soft reset" where the magical tear and breath instantly resolve the lifetime of "hoarded love" without a complicating turn or price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a cohesive accumulative logic where the garden’s shifts mirror the internal journey, leading to a strong on-page closure. The resolution achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist accepts the "fading" nature of the present, paying a conceptual cost that feels earned within the dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is resonant, successfully shifting from a heist to a mythic distribution of hope. However, the central puzzle solution ("builders loved jokes") relies on convenient backstory logic rather than active, pressure-tested problem solving. The use of the arrow to jam the gears provides a strong, tangible causal beat at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative structure functions well as a lyrical process story, moving from theory to proof (the diver) to personal application. The use of the diver episode as a summary/flashback reduces immediate tension, making the climax feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a high-stakes test.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Structure is a clean, linear ritual progression that satisfies the Accumulative/Ritual lens. The sequence of unlocking the station and the room flows logically. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the middle lacks significant causal complications or unexpected obstacles to test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from entry to preparation, establishing a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. However, the progression is linear and low-stakes; the "cost" is limited to physical exertion ("arms shook") rather than a difficult trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative drive is clear, but the causality relies on an unexplained magical convenience: a seashell found after a stunt that somehow functions as a verification device for a child's code. This disconnect between the gritty, realistic premise (debts, stunts) and the sudden divinatory magic of the shell weakens the structural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is distinct and resonant (the exchange of the book, the separation), with a legible shift in the status quo. The narrative arc relies heavily on atmospheric logic rather than hard causality to resolve the central conflict, but the situational drive lens holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The looped structure is executed with masterful economy, using each repetition to deepen the thematic argument rather than just replay events. The drive lens is Accumulative, building layers of meaning until the "mechanical blossom" of the fourth loop offers a resonant closure. The structure perfectly serves the premise of a "second chance" as practice rather than correction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc, but the climax relies on a convenient "magic prop" resolution where projecting small ticket doodles resolves deep social mistrust instantly. The ending lacks a "felt cost" required for higher bands; the narrator admits fault but receives only a "slow nod" of acceptance, making the closure feel tidy rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong: the protagonist's specific deception triggers the maze's specific rebellion, leading to a necessary confession. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where prizes become witnesses—lands with thematic weight. The resolution (speech act fixes the magic) is slightly swift, but the final image of the unlatched gate earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal trajectory from the missing mantas to the experimental resolution. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: the proof of his theory arrives not just as data, but as a personal, existential echo (seeing himself), which satisfies the prompt's requirement for a felt/conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream logic where metaphors become physical mechanics (reflections becoming maps). The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration; the disruption of the drowning loop is felt, and the return to stasis carries the weight of the spectral bargain. The pacing from observation to action is well-managed within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) as the lie is named and the internal weight shifts. The plot moves causally from the accidental smudge to the balance test and finally the confession, with the drive lens holding firmly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tightly wound; the "radio map" serves as a unique entry point, but the resolution is strictly mechanical and earned through physical effort. The closure is excellent: a Conceptual Repricing where the "ghost" is revealed as human intention ("stubborn metal"), and forgiveness is granted to the machine, not the men.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural logic, where the pressure of the rising river forces a shift in state rather than a causal plot twist. Closure is achieved through a resonant return to stasis ("set the swan back on its saucer"), validated by the survival of the chronicles. The "dream logic" (origami guiding the way, books mending skin) functions well within the established tone, though the resolution in the obsidian room feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is clear and resonant (the locket on the guitar during totality), and the Accumulative lens holds well as the eclipse paces the emotional arc. The structure is competent, though the progression is linear and the resolution feels somewhat tidy given the weight of the grief involved.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, gathering clues to a Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the progression relies heavily on convenient discovery (finding the map exactly when needed) rather than causal agency or overcoming obstacles. The realization that the "displaced axis" unseated dreams is a beautiful poetic leap but lacks a solid causal foundation in the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a coherent fable logic where the subversion of the spy plot resolves the town's stagnation, achieving a resonant closure. However, the climax relies on a "magic lantern" physics (projecting microdots via a lighthouse lens to legible text) that strains credibility even within magical realism, and the resolution comes too easily without active obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, and the closure lands with a clear Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing (the contract of grief acknowledged, not merely erased). The logic holds within the lyrical frame, though the resolution relies on a prepared tool (the palette) rather than an improvised adaptation to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds firmly, building density through sensory layers (kitchen, library, hospital) toward the dawn. Closure acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing, transforming the "cryptic jokes" of the fortunes into "instructions for breath" with a legible shift in meaning and a felt sense of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Situational/Accumulative drive, moving from the procedure of the tablet to the realization of the timeline's trap. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the physical act of landing fundamentally alters the protagonist's relationship to the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is a clean, coherent single scene that functions well under a lyric/accumulative lens. The "absurd surgery" of the drum and needle operates on a consistent magical-realist logic that the story teaches early. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's view of her art and future is effectively reprogrammed by the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive change at closure (data sent, escape secured). The causality of the bird's arrival is slightly convenient—arriving exactly when needed with a tube suitable for the protagonist's counter-move—but fits the fable-like logic. The physical mechanics of the escape (stepping "sideways" while the watcher stands passively) are soft, relying on dream logic over tactical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is solid, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the vial transforms from a trap to a compass. While the coincidence of the mother's hidden UV script matching the greenhouse's inventory is slightly convenient, it functions effectively to force the closure within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure follows a dream-like, accumulative logic (Track A/B hybrid) where images pile up rather than events driving consequences. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) with the rope braiding, but the causal chain leading there is tenuous and relies on the entity granting visions upon request.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, building density through the ritual and the gathering of the community. Orientation is solid, and the "unbinding" provides a legible trajectory for the scene. The closure—an agreement to "practice magnificent simplicity"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost ("gentle obligations") feels light and abstract rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the client’s internal map is successfully rewritten into a "pulse." The closure is earned through the on-page preparation and exchange of the blotter, with a felt cost in the narrator's waived fee and lingering solitude. The causal chain is tight, linking the chemical process directly to the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a summary spanning weeks rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default without teaching a mosaic pattern. Causality is soft and frictionless; events like finding Hideo or the granddaughter's arrival happen via authorial fiat rather than earned narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The linear quest structure works well for a fable, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing (posture over picture). However, the investigation phase is heavily summarized ("We made a pact... Our method was not merely a scavenger hunt"), which flattens the causal tension leading to the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a tight, causal arc where the magic system's mechanics (interrupted cadence) directly drive the plot progression. The inciting incident (seeking the echo) leads naturally to the climax (the interruption and capture) and resolution (release and repayment). Closure is definitive, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the world (a new sound born) with a clear conceptual cost (repayment of time).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the ritual leaving of the eyes, but the mechanics of the "rope of light" create confusion. It is unclear whether the rope is a literal tether (connecting his pocket to the stalactite, physically restraining him?) or a purely metaphorical image; this ambiguity blurs the physical reality of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is achieved with a clear change in the protagonist's stance (accepting visibility through traces), but the plot relies on a significant spatial coincidence: the mother's hiding spot is identical to the protagonist's personal cache. This convenience simplifies the search and lowers the earned causality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure relies on a wide-scope montage ("On the morning," "Nights brought," "Soon the town") that violates the short-story scope without mastering the mosaic form. The resolution lacks cost; when she releases control, the plants immediately flourish ("it was not a tangle but a treaty"), removing all narrative tension and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fable-like structure is coherent, and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration via ritual exchange) lands with clear conceptual weight. The progression is linear and logical under the atmospheric lens, though the "rain trails" function somewhat conveniently as plot vectors rather than sources of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a refusal to hoard power in favor of community connection—lands with clear conceptual cost (giving up the treasure). However, the causality relies on "unseen forces" stepping in to override the guide's attempt to intervene, which weakens the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, layering ritual and memory to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ledger. The closure is strong, shifting the definition of absence from a void to a navigated channel with a clear conceptual cost (the shift from monument to practice). The causality is driven by the shared ritual, effectively securing the lyrical logic of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic, but the causality is linear and low-resistance; obstacles are overcome immediately upon presentation. The closure acts as a soft reset, resolving the tension through a symbolic gesture that lacks a felt, concrete cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative relies on a situational drive where magical elements (whales, tile, door) resolve the central tension rather than protagonist agency. The shift from "auditing" to performing a mystical ritual is abrupt, and the closure—a magical room that solves the grief—feels like a gift from the setting rather than a consequence of the lead's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a ritual setup to a transformative crossing and a changed aftermath. However, the resolution relies on a metaphorical "magic box" logic where the corridor acts as a therapy machine that extracts payment and dispenses healing, creating a sense of transaction rather than causal struggle. The "spatial mutiny" is resolved somewhat abstractly, lowering the sense of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    A flawlessly structured scene where the "breach" serves as a high-stakes climax. Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the tools of the father's con (ink, ledger) are transformed into instruments of truth and asylum.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds the weight of the ritual, leading to a valid Earned Stasis closure where the narrator reaffirms their vigil. The narrative logic holds under the textural lens, though the plot is low-pressure by design, prioritizing mood over causal pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and logical, moving from accidental discovery to investigation and finally to confrontation. Closure lands with high impact; the handover of the label is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the power dynamic between the survivor and the widow. The narrative drive holds the lens of investigation perfectly through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative establishes a coherent fable logic, but the resolution relies on a *deus ex machina* figure stepping out of the draft to explain the theme. This reduces the causal impact of the protagonist's actions; he asks for help, and it is granted without complication or sacrifice. The ending feels soft, lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure ("bought us only a season") provides a valid earned stasis. However, the climax relies on a convenient mechanical solution—the chip interacting with the console to move the city—which resolves the tension with "mythic" ease rather than causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Procedural drive (the countdown of the vials) that effectively builds tension toward the climax. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist succeeds in the goal (the photo) but realizes the limit of that success (the "hush" cannot be archived). A slight friction exists in the "dew" and "smoke plumes" physics within a vacuum/solar-wind setting, though the story frames the location as an anomaly ("what should not exist").

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure lands, but the logic relies on "magical" physics (blindly reading light refraction via vibration) that strains the causal chain. The resolution—using rain in a bowl—is a convenient micro-turn that solves the problem without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic causality suited to the magical realism frame. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the map, though the linear progression—instruction, action, success—lacks a significant reversal or obstacle to spike the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, fable-like accumulation where the outcome feels inevitable; the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual, and the town heals without significant setbacks. While the "Resonant Reconfiguration" (silence to sound) works structurally, the lack of a distinct "felt cost" or a moment where the plan risks failure flattens the dramatic arc. The resolution arrives via a smooth montage of cooperation rather than a sharp causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully blending technical mission steps with dream-logic physics. Closure is solid, with the successful signal altering the status quo, though the physical "tug" of the reply feels slightly convenient given the acoustic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands with a coherent "Charged Poise," but the inciting causality—bluffing past guards into a prison with a transparent lie about the "heritage board"—strains credibility and breaks the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative employs a lyrical montage ("ephemeral cameo appearances") to compress the timeline; while this fits the fable mode, it softens immediate scene pressure until the final exchange. Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the weight of the "stone bead" and the solitude it implies.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear ritual progression, but the resolution relies on magical convenience (bells ringing themselves, sluices opening automatically) rather than earned causality. The closure feels unearned because the protagonist pays no visible on-page price for the massive transformation of the town.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "healing" arc that lacks causality or cost; the resolution feels inevitable and unearned. Closure lands as "symmetric satisfaction" where the environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's desires, and the "cost" of the reconfiguration is purely asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent under an Accumulative lens, moving from decoding to decision. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the target’s identity. However, the resolution relies on a coincidence (the busker's violin triggering the name "Auricle") rather than active problem-solving. The causal mechanics of the "own hand" beat are murky, creating momentary disorientation about who is writing the chalk code.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure works beautifully for this magical realist investigation, leading to a clear revelation. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the candle watching, the protagonist escaping through sleep), though the transition from "whisper" to "speech" feels slightly rushed. The magical logic is consistent and drives the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lyric drive lens holds firmly, guiding the narrative from the physical entry into the swamp to the metaphysical retrieval of the memory. Closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration ("share the hinge," "not decide") that feels earned by the ritual. The integration of the flashback via the water mirror is smooth and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution relies heavily on the surgeon's off-stage medical success to break the room's tension, making the narrator's thematic work feel decorative. The "Also Us" realization resolves generational conflict with implausible ease, lacking structural resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, gathering elements (film, community, light) toward a resonant closure. However, the central obstacle (damaged film) is resolved with low causal resistance via the "knowledge network," making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned. The ending lands as a valid "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the lack of friction in the middle weakens the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure uses an accumulative lens effectively, with each "nested awakening" deepening the stakes until the resonant reconfiguration at the climax. The closure is distinct and decisive: the narrator explicitly chooses a complex, living history over the curator’s requested static perfection, paying the conceptual cost of leaving with "questions that hum."

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative builds a compelling accumulative structure, transitioning smoothly from general context to the specific crisis night. However, the resolution—where officers laugh and immediately cancel the levy—feels slightly convenient given the established menace of the "teeth" and towers, deflating the tension rather swiftly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear progression but lacks causal friction; events happen because it is the "fifth cycle" or because the prompt dictates it, not due to protagonist agency. The closure resolves into a utopia without a palpable on-page price, missing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive: a specific repair task with a defined deadline (the escaping sound). Closure is strong and resonant (Earned Stasis), effectively tying the specific repair to the broader theme of stewardship, though the "rain-dial" backstory flashback is slightly disconnected from the immediate causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "magical argument" structure provides a clear causal chain, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the revision of the coda. The appearance of Lio is slightly convenient—loosening from the shadow—but fits the archive's dreamlike logic without breaking the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pivot relies on a severe causality break: identifying specific lovers from the smell of glue ("tea and smoke") is an unearned knowledge leap that resolves the central mystery instantly. The resolution is too tidy, with deep factional conflicts evaporating via a simple nod, lacking visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, using the eviction threat ("attic will be cleared") to effectively tighten the timeline and force the climax. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the Mars chip is sent, signaling a shift in stance. The causality is linear and functional, though the connection between the eviction and the specific timing of the final song feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear accumulative logic where the surreal mechanics (reading weather codes in wood grain) successfully trigger the climax. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator chooses separation as a form of connection—lands with genuine emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent, dream-logic progression from arrival to acceptance, effectively utilizing a "test of worthiness" structure. While the linear success sequence lacks grit, the closure lands a successful Conceptual Repricing (maps as companions, not destinations) that reframes the journey's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is strong (Conceptual Repricing of the missing path as protection), but the middle relies on dream-logic convenience (the bird appearing on command) that weakens causality. The narrative arc is clear and resolves the central question effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a flawless situational arc where a small, orchestrated trigger (the bishop falling) generates a resonant emotional consequence. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the relationships in the arcade, landing with the specific, cost-laden image of the janitor paying "rent" for the star.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story succeeds as a lyric shard with an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The transition from the act of tattooing to the acceptance of "elective exile" as a vocation provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure that feels earned within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving smoothly from the problem (the commission) to the ritualistic method and final vision. The transition to the boy's arrival is handled well. The ending shifts into a future-tense projection ("By noon I will..."), which distances the closure slightly, but the conceptual reconfiguration of the atrium design is a valid, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scene unfolds with perfect pacing, anchoring clearly in the setting before tightening the emotional screws. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where private grief transforms into a shared civic act—lands with genuine weight and inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the climax ("A chorus of me worked until our decorations became mathematics") rather than dramatizing the breakthrough. The resolution arrives via procedural assertion without a visible cost, failure, or moment of genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure works well for this dream-logic narrative, leading to a legible moment of closure ("Earned Stasis") where the burden is accepted. The "hopscotch" sequence provides a surreal but coherent causal bridge between the negative and the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and cohesive, moving effectively from the inciting arrival to the resonant ritual and final "joining." The closure is strong, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator learns to "coax" rather than command futures, creating a satisfying resolution to the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc from arrival to the signing of the "breathing" draft. The orientation is immediate and the pacing matches the "slow dance" of the prompt. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the shift from war to "inventory"—though the pivotal turn relies slightly on the sentimental trope of children's wisdom to break the deadlock.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear ritualistic structure that delivers a legible Conceptual Repricing; the protagonist trades the physical egg for the absolution of the echo. The closure lands with visible cost—the irreversible destruction of the unique object—anchoring the abstract theme in a concrete change.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure is achieved through a "magic solves everything" ending where the climax (guards arriving) is neutralized instantly by the ritual without struggle. The logic is purely symbolic; the causal link between untangling threads and the city waking is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence—the woman entering the dome just as Sorin resolves to change methods—which undercuts causal earning. Additionally, the ending dissolves into summary ("On opening night"), replacing dramatized scenic struggle with a narrated account of success, which blunts the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is slight, relying on a single interaction with a butterfly that the narrator imbues with heavy symbolic meaning. The closure ("waited for history to answer") is passive, lacking a decisive change or felt cost beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the ritual casting process to externalize the internal arc of repair. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the bells' command to "stay, cast, listen" earns the shift in the protagonist's state with tangible, conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from stasis (waiting) to a decisive change (leaving), with the seal-breaking serving as a clear inciting incident. The causality follows a dream-logic that fits the tone, though the transition from the bunker to the forest door relies on surreal convenience rather than strict cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean and linear; the discovery of the tile logically leads to the mapping, the alignment, and the final choice. The closure (signing the covenant) acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, solidifying the protagonist's role with legible cost. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative flow is dreamlike and coherent until the final beat, where a significant continuity error disrupts closure. The narrator presses the box into Rell's hands ("Keep it"), Rell leaves, yet immediately after, the narrator "close[s] the lid" of the box they just gave away. This physical impossibility breaks the reality of the final image and muddles the cost of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the objective shifts from capture to integration. The logic of "recreating the room" to lure the dream is established early and paid off with a coherent change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, resonant arc where the physical ritual (pruning, ringing the bell) facilitates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's grief. The closure—leaving the tin unopened while shedding the vows—is a distinct, cost-laden choice that earns the stasis. The orientation is immediate and the "unspent intention" provides coherent causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causality is consistent within the dream-logic of the setting, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively with the "curator of the between" realization. The cost is paid via the cameo, creating a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality relies entirely on surreal association rather than logical progression; the resolution ("offering tenses as handholds") solves a physical problem with a metaphorical concept, breaking narrative tension. The closure lands on a conceptual shift, but the lack of concrete cost or constraint makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a coherent surreal logic where the environment responds to memory and narrative. The closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist trades their observer identity (the ledger) for the garden, adhering strictly to the established cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of competence without a pivotal reversal or obstacle; the protagonist succeeds immediately upon trying. While the restoration of the ledger constitutes a change, the lack of a "felt cost" or risk of failure makes the closure feel unearned and procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear structure with a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure ("they learn where to be quiet"). While the arc is solid and the orientation clear, the resolution feels smooth; the protagonist succeeds through skill without facing a pivotal moment of doubt or failure that would earn a higher causality score.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a linear fix-it arc where the central problem is resolved largely through the convenient arrival of a partner who possesses the exact missing puzzle pieces (map and backstory). While the closure (rekindling the beacon) is clear and resonant, the causal path relies heavily on "coincidence as choreography," which, while thematically consistent, lowers narrative tension and makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path from routine to crisis to resolution, with a legible decisive change at the climax where the narrator steps into the rain. The closure is resonant and structurally sound, though the "lightning said" moment risks resolving the tension through external permission rather than relying solely on internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, following a clear fable-like progression from arrival to resonant reconfiguration. However, the plot relies on convenient discoveries (the note, the knot) to solve problems without causal complications, making the path to closure feel somewhat linear and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is solid, utilizing the "pause" effectively as a narrative container for the flashback/projection beat. Orientation within the grotto is established early and maintained. Closure is decisive (the agreement to move), though the "foreseeing" section feels slightly convenient as a mechanism to force the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a cyclical gravity inversion to a singular, transformative interaction. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the father's acceptance of the "mapped hush" redefines the story's central parameter (safety) with visible conceptual cost to his original blueprints.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Situational drive where the transit forces an internal reconfiguration in the passenger. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration ("not a wall but a window") with visible cost—the surrender of the mathematician's need for proof—and the cycle of the storm glass provides a satisfying structural frame.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with strong orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the obstacles (waterfall, wall) yield readily to the characters' specific tools without generating significant friction or forcing tactical deviations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ritualistic structure provides a strong, coherent arc under a Situational lens. The sequence of return, challenge, teaching, and departure is logically sound within the story's mythic framework. Closure is effective, delivering an Earned Stasis for the narrator and a decisive crossing for the student.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is achieved through a decisive act that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to value ("ledger of breath"). The "concepts become physical" rule is established early, ensuring the surreal resolution feels causally earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is cohesive, using the ritualistic process to pace the reveal effectively. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the act of ending a dynasty into a constructive mercy, though the immediate transformation of the city below feels slightly unearned by the room-bound action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive; the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is earned as he trades the potential of "infinite miracles" for one concrete reality. The cost is legible in the image of the abandoned armor.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from discovery to closure via a Decisive Change (updating the file). However, the causal logic strains credibility when the protagonist deduces the specific identity and timeline of the previous visitor ("counselor... returned last week") solely from dust. This leap feels more convenient than earned, weakening the investigative chain.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves closure with the museum captions changing. However, causality is weak in the middle section; the "puddle map" relies on dream logic that disconnects from the story's otherwise grounded mechanical details.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is an exemplary instance of Earned Stasis, creating a "ring where the sentence nearly closed" that feels both victorious and precarious. The causal chain is tight—prophecy forms via condensation, music disrupts it—and the orientation is immediate and grounded. The drive lens (Accumulative/Situational) holds perfectly from the first drop of dew to the final withdrawal of mist.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive ritual structure under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is handled well, establishing the fantastic setting efficiently. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing of the prophecy, though the impact is dampened because the realization is explained rather than purely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is linear but coherent, functioning as a fable-like journey of discovery with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. While the progression relies on "tour-guide" causality—following the compass without active resistance or error—the closure lands with a legible conceptual shift regarding time and control.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a potent "Resonant Reconfiguration," where the narrator accepts the loss but alters the terms of carrying it. The "search > repair > weigh > fuse" sequence provides a sturdy causal spine that makes the abstract stakes physical. The realization ("I had always measured the wrong limit") feels earned by the process, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, moving smoothly from arrival to resolution. However, the turning point relies on summary ("We tested the door patiently") rather than dramatized action, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through difficulty. The backstory of the river and tooth feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from disorientation to reconfiguration. While the closure (turning back to the valley with a new rule) is legible, the climax involving the Caretaker feels low-friction; the resolution is given rather than seized, softening the causal impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, following a Situational/Procedural lens from arrival to retrieval. Closure is distinct and resonant (the name is restored, the scene alters). However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the magic functions essentially as technology without a moment of doubt, failure, or unexpected cost to complicate the trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear investigation with clear orientation and a distinct closure unit (winding the spring backward). The logic of the resolution—treating a mechanical spring as a metaphysical bank—operates successfully on a fairy-tale level, though the causality is more poetic than strict. The cost is conceptual ("stories that spend themselves") rather than visibly paid on the page by the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tight; the magic system's rules (imperfection = buoyancy) are taught early and dictate the climax. The closure (printing the asymmetrical moment) logically resolves the crisis with a legible price and creates a distinct "after" state.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, utilizing the "visible time" premise to drive both plot and resolution. The "mirror ritual" backstory is woven in effectively, serving as a setup that pays off beautifully in the climax without feeling like a Deus Ex Machina. The closure—a revision of the archive coupled with the loss of the shard—lands with genuine conceptual and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a tight causal arc where the protagonist's unique skills and traits directly resolve the central conflict. Closure is definitive and resonant, paying off the setup with a transformed status quo where the "mending" philosophy is re-contextualized.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is exemplary; the sacrifice of the boots and compass is a decisive on-page action with tangible cost that enacts the thematic realization. The causal logic of the setting—where scent opens stone—is established early and pays off beautifully in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a ritualistic linear path (arrival, projection, construction, realization) lacking causal friction or resistance. The "magic" slide solves the central problem too easily, and the closure—a realization that reaffirms the premise—lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("In spring...", "Summer passed...") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope expectation for short fiction. The structure is a linear accumulation of successes without setbacks. Closure provides a thematic connection (grandmother's note) but lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; it reads as a gift rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magical logic is coherent; the ritual of debris-arranging causally triggers the clerk's descent and the diary's unlocking. The closure effectively reconfigures the city's relationship to its history, though the mechanism of feeding punches to the diary moves very swiftly in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a smooth, fable-like arc of accumulation (gathering people, stacking plans) rather than sharp reversals. While the closure—the bottle ticking as a sign of earned time—is thematically resonant and satisfies the conceptual stakes, the plot lacks significant active opposition, making the success feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative establishes a harsh binary choice: refuse the vow and the orchard dies, or accept it and a child suffers. The resolution ("negotiation" via memory) sidesteps this causality, allowing the protagonist to save the child while the quinces "keep their grip," effectively erasing the established cost. This soft reset at the climax weakens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative arc as a ritual enactment, concluding with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (spring returns). However, the linear progression lacks causal tension, obstacles, or a felt cost beyond the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear inciting incident and decision point that lands a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. However, the storm's "embarrassed" retreat leans heavily on magical convenience, softening the causal link between choice and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative lens holds well, transitioning smoothly from maintenance to the mystical ending. Closure is achieved through the decisive action of opening the roof, though the station's anthropomorphism slightly strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight and elegant, moving from established ritual to disruption (the Queen) to a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose. The causal link between his past negligence (pesticides/contracts) and his present burden grounds the fable-like logic. Closure is distinct and earned; the stasis at the end feels charged with new meaning rather than merely stopping.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, gathering methods and allies to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration (the new calendar). However, the progression relies on low-resistance fabulist logic—Lio arrives simply because the ads were posted, and the capsule opens to &quot;patience&quot; rather than a costly struggle. The closure lands thematically but feels inevitable rather than earned against odds.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative is a coherent vignette with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the boy's grief is reframed), but it lacks causal tension. The resolution comes through wise instruction rather than struggle, and the static nature of the POV character limits the structural impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story relies on a montage/summary structure spanning six months rather than a dramatized continuous scene or focused shards, which violates the scope default and dilutes tension. While the closure lands with a resonant image, the narrative drive feels more like a chronicle of successes than a causal chain of choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative structure, building through the ritual steps (arrival, offering, synthesis) to a clear Conceptual Repricing closure ("home is a rate constant"). The pacing is steady and the orientation remains stable, though the linear progression lacks significant structural surprises or causality-driven turns.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story succeeds as a lyric/accumulative narrative, establishing a clear ritual that tightens into a resonant closure. The progression from scattering seeds to physically reclaiming bayonets creates a coherent structural arc, and the final image of the morning glory trellis effectively reconfigures the war imagery (Resonant Reconfiguration).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is linear and the closure (establishing contact) is legible, but the causality relies heavily on "dream logic" (e.g., wax from a leaf creating a visual projection on a phonograph). While poetic, the mechanical linkage between the leaf, the cylinder, and the relay is tenuous and lacks grounded plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, using the ritual to build pressure toward a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end. The redefinition of the compass rose provides a satisfying, textually earned closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot follows a linear ritual logic that holds together, but the ending relies on the teacher appearing to explicitly validate the protagonist's actions, which acts as a convenience that deflates the narrative tension and ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Accumulative lens works well, stacking the "spelled" words (water, stay, hush) to build emotional resonance toward a legible Conceptual Repricing at the end. The sequence provides a clear arc of deepening intimacy and the closure validates the narrator's transient role. However, the narrative lacks causal propulsion or urgency; events unfold smoothly without complication, obstacle, or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is solid, following a clear accumulation of magical logic toward a resonant reconfiguration. The causality of the ritual (feather/stone leads to memory, seeding leads to structural shift) holds together well under the magic realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is elegant, utilizing the tapestry as a seamless mechanism to translate the protagonist's chess expertise into a solution that fits the magical realism frame. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the village's state that mirrors the tutor's internal release. The transition from the board to the "weave" is logical within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the central conflict dissolves rather than escalating; the "heavy as stone" price is bypassed by a magical loophole without significant resistance from the setting or antagonists. The arrival of the ritual keepers after the deed is done removes potential tension, resulting in a climax that feels frictionless and inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative drive is strong, utilizing a Hybrid lens where mechanical actions yield emotional results. Closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration; the workshop rising serves as a tangible metric for the internal stabilization. The pacing is effectively governed by the breath-holding constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure creates a coherent fable logic where the "wrong turn" and the painting of the water operate as earned magical realism rather than convenience. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the cracked mirror is not fixed but recontextualized as a symbol of chosen duality, satisfying the prompt's requirement for a felt cost (living with the split). The pacing is controlled, moving from the studio to the cave and back with a clear causal chain driven by the protagonist's commitment to the promise. The "wrong turn" leading to the right place is a classic trope handled here with thematic justification.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, adhering to a fabulist logic where intent and scent drive causality. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship turns, and the mentor validates the method, shifting the status quo meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight, following a clear Accumulative logic from construction to quest to epiphany. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the concept of "reverse migration" changes the protagonist's relationship to their duty and grief. The return to the station feels earned rather than cyclic, carrying the weight of the journey's insight.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident (patrol) and a clever resolution where the protagonist uses the "truth" constraint to their advantage. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis; while the patrol's retreat relies partially on the storm (environment), the protagonist's "careful sequence" of honesty holds the tension long enough for that factor to work.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (sweeping the dock, sending the signal) is resonant. The causal chain weakens when the solution relies on a supernatural memory download rather than active deduction, acting as a convenient bridge between the clue and the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight, with the "following ants" logic taught early and paid off mechanically at the creek. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist gains a compass for daily living—is earned and distinct, anchoring the magical realism in tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, utilizing a causal loop that feels mythic yet logical. Closure is decisive: the Queen's choice to wake the stone self enacts a Resonant Reconfiguration of her identity with a clearly articulated cost ("who you will not be able to forgive"). The ending image of the pool—"calm as an eye"—lands the resolution perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clear Situational/Textural arc, moving from the challenge (the dare) through the ritual to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the friendship. The closure is earned and legible on the page, with the "proof" serving as a concrete token of the internal shift. The narrative drive holds steady, anchoring the abstract magic in a logical sequence of cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a coherent dream-logic that successfully lands a Conceptual Repricing closure, transforming the grave from an ending into a ledger entry. The transition from waking to dreaming and back is managed with clear anchors, ensuring the surrealism remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, but the resolution relies on the convenient fit of the "midwife's screw" and an off-screen text message. The causal chain is soft; the repair succeeds without a moment of mechanical doubt or failure, reducing the narrative drive to a gentle drift.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a tight Accumulative arc where the ritual steps build pressure coherently toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The "held breath" acts as a tangible ticking clock that binds the physical and emotional stakes. Closure is earned through the completion of the rite, leaving the protagonist internally altered even as the external storm remains.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tight and character-driven; the narrative makes a successful decisive leap from the ghost's cryptic drawing (the peach) to the protagonist's tangible action (the phone call). The closure lands with a clear "Decisive Change" that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to their own past and profession.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, utilizing the "universe's hiccup" effectively to frame the protagonist's memory state and mission. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the new definition in the dictionary, though the linear progression meets little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally linked; the "lag" provokes the "heresy," which leads directly to the injury and the epiphany. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the "note to the foreman" solidifies the narrator's new stance with a tangible professional risk. The transition from mechanical error to "boundary event" is executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story functions well as a meditative vignette, following an Accumulative/Textural drive lens where small interactions build to a shift in perspective. Closure lands with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration ("hospitality" replacing "vigilance"), but the narrative lacks strong causal propulsion. The stakes remain largely abstract, creating a sense of low dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent emotional logic (Accumulative/Textural lens), but the causal mechanics strain credibility. The connection between subway graffiti and a specific library alcove relies on unearned coincidence or undefined magical realism ("Maybe the city itself"). The presence of the lantern on the windowsill—presumably undisturbed by librarians for days or months—creates a distraction regarding plausibility that the poetic tone doesn't fully smooth over.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structural shift to summary ("For the next weeks") immediately following the climax dissipates the narrative tension and softens the closure. By moving into a generalized coda, the story bypasses the immediate aftermath and cost of the specific scene, resulting in a resolution that feels somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The resolution relies on the convenient arrival of the partner at the precise moment the "map" is finished, acting as a soft reset that resolves the central tension externally. The causality implies a fable-like magic that isn't fully established, making the climax feel like a coincidence rather than a protagonist-driven outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for the lyric mode, building density effectively. Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the map of favors, though the arrival of the neighbors feels slightly convenient and lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the goal (finding the stillpoint) succeeds but recontextualizes the desire from erasing grief to finding an "axis" within it. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly, teaching the navigational pattern and paying it off with a coherent internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully blending memory with the sci-fi premise. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the past is edited; however, the resolution feels slightly low-cost (the seeds arrive, fixing the debt) and relies on a "fix-it" ending that leans heavily on the mentor's intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, but the closure relies on a summary of future actions ("Arin would play it...") rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost. While the sequence of sketching and bell-ringing is legible, the lack of resistance makes the causal chain feel loose and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear scavenger hunt where clues yield immediately to the protagonist's intuition without meaningful resistance or setbacks. The causality blurs between high-tech (corridor overlay) and magical realism (seeds writing names) without establishing clear ground rules, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual to breakthrough to consequence with a clear closure effect (Mira wakes, reality reconfigured). While the "dream logic" of the garden works for the genre, the causal mechanism relies heavily on metaphor ("intention could tune stone") rather than concrete interaction, slightly softening the plot's mechanical rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration via the courier's rescue), but the path is resistance-free. The inciting problem creates a linear track to success without setbacks or causal complications that force the protagonist to adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from observation to participation and confession. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, though the logic operates on dream-like association rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic where the plan succeeds without causal resistance or complication. While the closure (the town slowing down) is coherent, it arrives via assertion rather than earned narrative pressure or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a mythic logic, but the climax suffers from a lack of resistance; the crowd cheers immediately, and the ropes unknot themselves, removing the tension of the decision. The causality feels dream-like, where obstacles dissolve rather than requiring a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure effectively uses a mosaic approach, blending routine, a crucial flashback, and a specific present-day sequence to build the world and stakes. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the narrator redefines the mandate’s terms from "joy" to "lightness." The transition from the inspector anecdote back to the present scene is slightly abrupt but functionally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent as a ritual of transition, and the closure (stepping onto the ice) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the lack of narrative obstacles—the guard capitulates instantly, and the ban is already lifted—lowers the structural tension, making the outcome feel inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on a "Days later" summary montage to resolve the story, dissipating the specific tension of the market scene before it can peak. While the fable logic is coherent, the absence of substantial obstacles makes the closure feel inevitable and predetermined rather than earned by protagonist agency. The orientation is clear, but the drive dissipates into a static tableau rather than a causal snap.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("At the first station... The second station...") rather than dramatized scene work, which flattens the arc; the ending lands on a stated realization without a decisive structural turn or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure effectively transitions from setup to a mosaic of service and finally to a specific scene, ending in valid Earned Stasis. The convenience of the observatory's readiness (keys, password, mechanism) and the dream-logic of the origami invites soften the causal grounding, but the arc holds together well as a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mosaic structure effectively uses the "client visit" pattern to deepen the world and premise, culminating in a resonant conceptual repricing at the end ("finding the chorus"). The transition to the mural scene provides necessary kinetic movement, though the closure feels more like a thematic restatement (Earned Stasis) than a sharp dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression (ascent via surreal imagery) where obstacles yield to abstract assertions ("blinked without rhythm") rather than causal tactics. While the closure (returning to teach rather than publish) is legible, the path there lacks causal tension; the archive’s challenges are overcome by fiat rather than struggle. Orientation is maintained, but the episodic structure feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is complete with a distinct closure unit (the sacrifice), but the climatic complication (the library's sudden jealousy) feels slightly convenient to force the trade, lacking earlier setup of the environment's possessive nature. The resolution relies on soft magic established in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.4)
    A masterclass in Situational drive; the medical procedure perfectly mirrors the conceptual repair of the shelter's integrity. Closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the letter acts as a cost-bearing mechanism that reweights the narrator's stance from victim to steward. The parallel tracks of healing the lizard and healing the shelter converge flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure works well, moving from the tower's stasis to the tunnel's confrontation. The causal chain is clear, guided by the ivy, and the closure—a ritualistic reconfiguration of the grief—lands with genuine weight. The logic of the "fossilized coffee ring" fits the established magical realism perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc that tightens into a causal resolution when the protagonist recognizes her own name. The closure action—writing a counter-letter—is a decisive change that effectively reconfigures the story's initial state.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where metaphors immediately manifest as physical results without established causal rules (tracing a star creates a script). The resolution with the sculptor is a "soft reset" that solves the problem instantly without narrative friction or trade-offs. Closure is a thematic restatement ("we build a bridge") rather than a Decisive Change or Reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear ritual arc—unrest, engagement (the game), and release/reconfiguration—that holds the reader despite the dream-logic. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive sleeps, the train becomes a greenhouse, and the guard resumes their vigil. The causality of the magic system ("promises count in ruins") is internally consistent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the linear quest is coherent, the resolution relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist finds a library that explicitly explains his purpose. The climax resolves the problem (the broken tree) and immediately rewards the protagonist with answers, lacking a felt cost or complication to earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic progression that lacks causal friction or surprise; the outcome feels inevitable from the start. The turning point relies on compliance (&quot;So I do&quot;) rather than an earned decision made under pressure. While the allegorical structure is legible, the low stakes and cooperative environment remove the tension required for a compelling plot.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a valid accumulative arc, moving from the concrete task of fixing the bench to a resonant conceptual closure. However, the transition ("Days accumulated...") dissipates the scene's immediate tension, shifting into summary before the final beat. The timeline of the "seventh week" relative to the initial bench-fixing is slightly murky, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a decisive closure where the protagonist's trap springs successfully. While the "rune of drift" functions somewhat abstractly to arrange the confrontation, the tangible payoff with the ink pellet anchors the resolution in earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure moves fluidly from investigation to resolution, but the climax (the village crossing) is handled in summary rather than a high-pressure scene. The "Assemble" key functioning as both a console command and a thematic directive is a clever if slightly convenient pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from entry to discovery to revelation, culminating in a Decisive Change (shifting the rebellion’s focus). However, the progression is low-friction; the machine works instantly upon contact, and the stated risk of "waking whoever had silenced them" never materializes as a concrete obstacle, making the victory feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, with a clear inciting incident (the kite) and a decisive closure event (the unsealing). The "instruction manual found on a kite" is a bit of a convenient coincidence for the inciting move, but Lida's choice to use it anchors the causality in character. The resolution lands with a definitive change in the community's status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece effectively uses a Mosaic structure (Track B), teaching the pattern of temporal jumps early to cover a longer period. The transitions are legible, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the grafts represent "stitches" and healing—lands with genuine emotional weight. The summary nature of the transitions slightly dilutes the pressure of individual scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from arrival to a decisive, materialized act of closure. The logic of the tarot-thread wick operates effectively within the story's lyrical physics, and the ending feels structurally earned despite the dream-logic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality follows a consistent surreal logic where the ink reveals the metaphysical market. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration: the market is dismantled not by force, but by a refusal to participate that recontextualizes the power dynamic. The ending lands with a clear conceptual cost (disappearance/identity dissolution).

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc moves cleanly from discovery to a resonant, world-altering release. The climax, however, relies on a convenient poetic leap ("rode the cough with code") where a physical letter enters a duct and becomes digital data without established mechanical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands, though the convenient discovery of the letter at the exact moment of resolution weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic where acoustic physics and myth blend seamlessly. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the release of the spike/map restores the coast, a decisive action with clear conceptual cost (returning the prize to save the source).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal arc is tight and logical: the "proof by contradiction" wager creates a clean experiment with an immediate, tangible result (the printers stalling). Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the machine's purpose, satisfying the "Causal" lens with clear on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    Closure lands with a clear decision to "stay," but a severe continuity error disrupts the climax: the woman takes the cabinet when she leaves ("took her child and the cabinet"), yet in the very next paragraph, the narrator opens "the cabinet's back panel" to find the resolution letter. Additionally, the timeline of acquiring the letters (found "years" ago vs. the cabinet arriving "tonight") is muddied by the "time folds" premise rather than solved by it.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from the setup of the "unlearning" to a micro-crisis and resolution via the tile flake. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (the map of the mess), which lands effectively. However, the conflict is resolved with minimal friction, making the causality feel somewhat soft and inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is functional, moving from a minor renaming (the mother) to a major one (the perpetrators), creating a valid deepening of scope. However, the progression lacks causal tension; the "men who fed the fire" submit immediately to the ritual, making the climax feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, building a ritualistic loop that lands on Earned Stasis. While the orientation and structure are sound, the climax resolves via a routine magic action ("speak the old marquee letters") that feels low-cost and lowers the dramatic impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly focused, moving from the disruption of the "static shock" to a resonant closure via the successful image capture. The "Resonant Reconfiguration" at the end—viewing the memory as a river forgiving a field—is earned and lands with genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship between observer and observed, paid for with the loss of the fossil. The narrative arc from "sensory mapping" to "partnered contract" is seamless and causal under the Textural/Situational lens. The storm provides a sharp, coherent pressure that forces the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic, culminating in a beautiful Conceptual Repricing of the warehouse from prison to bridge. However, the explicitly waived consequence for the theft ("confessed without punishment") softens the causal tension, making the victory feel somewhat cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scene structure is solid, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that lands on a decisive action (dropping the film). The closure is effective—a Resonant Reconfiguration where leverage is traded for a future—though the "nod" agreement mechanism feels a bit convenient and telepathic, lacking some frictional negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual enactment with low causal tension; the central obstacle (the current) is resolved instantly by a touch, bypassing earned struggle. Closure is achieved through symbolic assertion ("palimpsest promise settle") rather than a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure (arrival, ritual, success) without a decisive turning point or reversal. Closure is achieved through a resonant image (braided timelines), but the lack of causal obstacles makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is exemplary: a clear inciting incident (the petal) leads immediately to a goal-driven sequence with a coherent physical and emotional climax. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the lighthouse beam is conceptually repriced as a garden cutting to be rooted at home, satisfying the emotional stakes with visible conceptual cost. The narrative arc is tight and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the storm is quieted not by force but by a specific act of memory and vocalization. The causal chain—sundial diagnoses the knot, atlas provides coordinates, song restores balance—is distinct and satisfying under the Situational lens. The final image of the "word for shelter" cements the change.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, but it moves on a friction-free rail where intention immediately equals result. There are no setbacks, complications, or moments of doubt; the lovers arrive and comply perfectly with the narrator's design. The closure is a resolution, but it feels unearned because the "unspooling" faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from discovery to confrontation and resolution. While the closure is decisive and resonant, the town's rapid de-escalation ("asked for pancakes") feels slightly too convenient given the weight of the preceding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path with a distinct conceptual turn at the closure (re-aiming the telescope). While the "dream logic" of the organ and compass is consistent, the progression feels slightly mechanical—problem presented, magic tool applied, problem solved—lacking a moment where the established method fails or requires deeper adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central deduction (blue ribbon implies identity swap) is a tenuous intuitive leap that strains causality, relying on "artist's magic" rather than evidence. The resolution depends on a convenient off-screen letter that confirms this theory, bypassing on-page dramatic confrontation or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on high convenience ("lock and key" plotting) where the ancestor's ancient journal perfectly maps to a modern panel and the nail perfectly fits the slot. The closure is a Decisive Change, but it comes without a "felt or conceptual cost" on the page—the protagonist succeeds on all fronts without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative moves efficiently from the pullout to the bridge, with a clear inciting incident and climax, but the resolution relies on a soft magic system ("system reads music as policy") that feels convenient. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanics of the "ledger" signing the receipt are metaphorical, blunting the sense of concrete causality.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates as a fable or prose poem, effectively utilizing a summary/montage structure to compress the startup's lifecycle. While this fits the lyrical tone, it relies heavily on "telling" over "showing," bypassing dramatized scenes for the central conflict with investors. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing (the tire rut), but the lack of scenic immediacy holds the narrative back.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure, but the central problem yields too easily to the "conversation" key without a testing failure first. The solution feels unlocked by the narrator's sudden realization ("I saw my task") rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is tight and the problem-solution spine (seed eats lie) is established and executed cleanly. Closure is decisive with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship between mayor, town, and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration of the world's rules. The climax relies slightly on symbolic assertion ("we told them no") rather than a complex tactical maneuver, but the closure is distinct and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Accumulative structure that effectively leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The logic of the trade holds within the fable-like rules, and the ending lands with a felt cost—the loss of the grandmother’s card and stories—though the orientation relies heavily on atmospheric assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from resistance to acceptance via a tangible object (the grille cloth). The closure—a conceptual repricing of the artifact—is excellent. A slight momentum drag occurs with the late insertion of the "radio failure" exposition block, which feels momentarily disconnected from the scene in the trailer.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the external repair of the arbor perfectly mirrors the internal settling of ambition. The "grammar" magic system functions with rigorous consistency, paying off the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette depicting a successful ritual without causal obstruction, deeper complication, or the risk of failure. While the orientation is stable and the logic coherent, the closure ("she leaves," "I return") is a return to stasis without a decisive change or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fable-like structure delivers a clear Decisive Change, but the causality relies on dream-logic where crowning a spire magically rewrites reality, distancing the reader from mechanical stakes. Orientation is somewhat floating, treating the bunker as a metaphorical space rather than a grounded physical location.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scavenger hunt structure is linear but effectively charged by the narrator’s altered state; the causal links between the graffiti coordinates and the brother’s history feel earned within the story’s logic. Closure lands a solid Conceptual Repricing, shifting the narrator’s relationship to the river from control to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dream-logic progression moves smoothly from the watch to the door to the shelves, maintaining a consistent "Situational" drive lens. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration (becoming the messenger), though the journey is somewhat linear with obstacles yielding immediately to the correct ritual action rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, utilizing the noon deadline to create effective pressure. Closure is definitive and resonant: a Decisive Change where the artifact is physically transformed/destroyed, enacting the theme of propagation. The causal chain from the promise to the coffee reading to the final performance holds together beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ritual provides a clear causal spine under an Accumulative lens, leading to a clean Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The progression is smooth—perhaps too frictionless—as the success of the procedure feels guaranteed, but the final deposit of the "seed" in the archive effectively seals the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the fable-logic holds together, though the sequence moves with low causal friction. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of contentment, but the ease of the journey softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, with the chime ritual providing a structured crucible for the decision. The closure is decisive (returning the money/taxing), though the chimes offering a specific third policy option ("speak and set terms") leans slightly heavily on the fable-logic of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure successfully follows a fable-like logic, cycling from the ritual to a visionary climax and back to a resolution that recontextualizes the narrator's life. The closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing (vanishing as a gift), though the "dam" problem solved in the vision feels somewhat detached from the immediate platform stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, layering sensory inputs to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration (abandoning the stones for the empty cord). The arc is clean, and the closure—a conceptual shift in how the character engages with the world—lands with earned weight. Orientation and pacing are expertly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure flows seamlessly from the climb to the return; the closure serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new, earned ritual with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, moving smoothly from the pier to the library and back with clear orientation. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's relationship to their duty is transformed by the underwater vow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "backwards prophecy" is executed with impressive structural clarity, turning a potential logical mess into a tight causal loop. The sequence of actions—turning, distilling, tossing—aligns perfectly with the revelation, creating a satisfying and legible closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is exemplary, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to his loss is transformed from passive heartbreak to active mapping. The ending is earned through causal steps (the ritual, the struggle, the naming) and carries the felt cost of enduring "distant intimacy" rather than reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where observation leads to ritual and result, with a legible "Conceptual Repricing" closure (accepting the echo rather than the original). While the causal mechanics of the magic are soft (chanting names fixes the cosmos), the internal logic is consistent, and the ending lands with a distinct resonant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, leading to a resonant closure. However, the mechanism of the "trail of photographs"—paper artifacts surviving decades of submersion in a reservoir to be found intact in the mud—strains physical credibility (physics amnesia) and feels contrived as a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative forms a coherent, linear ritual beat with stable orientation and clear progression. However, the closure relies on a predictable success without a sharp, legible cost; the "balance" achieved is abstract rather than a price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structural arc is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a distinct climax where the watcher's action aids the ship. The closure lands well with a "Charged Poise" reconciliation, though the mechanics of the rope interaction could be established more concretely earlier to maximize the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is solid, moving from the introduction of the petitioners to the sparring tests and a decisive resolution. The "river" epiphany effectively sets up the logic for the final judgment (the "circuit"), ensuring the closure feels earned by the established rules of the world. The "history rewrites itself" refrain adds texture but operates loosely on the causal level.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands clearly with a Conceptual Repricing (valuing "roots" over "spectacle") sealed by the physical act of planting. However, the narrative arc relies heavily on reflection and hypothetical rehearsal rather than immediate, on-page interaction with the opposing forces.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from a distinct inciting atmosphere to a resonant resolution where laughter is restored. The closure is effective, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where Grief remains but is neutralized, though the causal mechanics are somewhat linear and dreamlike.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic appropriate for a dreamscape, moving from arrival to testing to transformation. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist carries the "threshold" back to waking life. The cost—a tithe of breath and a permanent shift in perception—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear decisive change (the gate opening/exit) and a felt cost (the destruction of the crozier). The drive is linear; while the ritual follows a process, the lack of significant setbacks makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central structural pivot—transforming the mast and gorge into a stylus and record—is an excellent Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visual logic. However, the discovery of the engineer's note acts as a narrative crutch, explaining the theme through text rather than letting the dramatization stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is excellent; the protagonist utilizes established tools (broom, patterns) to effect a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ship's reality. The logic of the surreal world is taught efficiently, and the ending pays off the "vanishing" stakes with a tangible arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative path, effectively building its thesis through the gallery exhibits to a resonant closure. The final bridge moment provides a solid Conceptual Repricing of the premise, though the visitor's arrival acts as a situational convenience rather than a causal development.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands with a powerful Conceptual Repricing, transforming the "unfolded horizons" from a map into a philosophy of surrender and guidance. The move from the classroom to the exterior ridge is efficiently paced, though the arrival of the aliens feels slightly serendipitous, it is thematically earned by the protagonist's active "listening."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence: selecting a specific hearing aid from a catalog based only on a vague description ("turned her right ear") which essentially acts as a magical homing beacon. While the genre invites surrealism, this specific causal link feels convenient rather than inevitable. The closure, however, is excellent, recontextualizing the "dead call" effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight, effectively utilizing the tidal clock to pressure the central task and force a clean exit. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist returns the stolen luck, closing her loop of guilt and acknowledging her worthiness to "bear the room." The cause-and-effect chain is unbroken, with the door mechanism serving as a well-integrated threshold puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is cohesive, moving cleanly from the ink ritual to the confrontation and recalibration. Closure is distinct and earned, with the restored archive and the "wiser kind of dark" providing a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative builds coherent pressure through the translation attempts, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds well. However, the closure dissolves into a summarized montage ("Travelers learned...", "When storms came...") rather than ending on the high-cost beat of the name sacrifice, which dilutes the immediate impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear accumulative logic that leads to a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's status. However, reliance on the cordless phone as a source of specific instruction dampens agency in the middle beats, making the protagonist reactive until the final decision to plant the arrowhead.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure, but the resolution feels unearned; the opposition (statues) crumbles too easily before the "magic" of the music. The lack of a complicating twist or a significant, irrevocable cost makes the victory feel inevitable and symmetric rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality holds; the jar delivery motivates the vision, which directly motivates the final letter delivery. Closure is achieved through a decisive action that effectively reconfigures the protagonist's routine, though the vision in the jar functions as a slightly convenient plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative flows with a coherent dream-logic, though the pivot relies on a convenient coincidence (the "wrong turn" leading to the magic oasis) that solves the central mechanical problem. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the train wakes, but the resolution feels somewhat "symmetric" and tidy, lacking a strong sense of unavoidable cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative creates a coherent arc of entry, ritual, and return under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the library's atmosphere—lands effectively, though the specific "cost" is more atmospheric than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative logic holds together well within the fable-like framework, successfully transitioning from the chase to the darkroom resolution. The closure—filing the capture under "Beginnings" and accepting the cycle—creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure supports the dream logic without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a coherent magical realist logic where symbolic actions yield concrete results. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the freeing of the idea reweights the protagonist's relationship to the mother's memory. The causal link between the ritual and the result is legible within the established genre rules.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is excellent; the ritual logic (truth for memory) creates a clear causal chain that resolves in a resonant reconfiguration of the logbook. The recovery of the specific "braid knot" memory serves as a tangible payoff to the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution relies on a "soft" victory where the antagonist yields immediately upon seeing a reflection/metaphor. The closure lacks a tangible, felt cost or a hard trade-off, making the victory feel unearned and the stakes low.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the solution (the child) arrives conveniently to facilitate the climax without complication. While the closure lands on a thematic note, the lack of causal friction or potential failure makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is immediate and the Accumulative arc is clear, leading to a distinct closure where spirits are grounded. However, the resolution—finding the locket via a hymn—feels structurally convenient; the problem is solved by a summoned answer rather than a difficult trade-off or ingenuity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the map's tear to the video investigation and the chapel's reopening. The closure—framing the map with the wound visible—offers a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the central mystery. The progression is smooth, perhaps too smooth, with few obstacles obstructing the path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, moving from atmospheric exploration to a specific retrieval and departure. The closure—taking the snow globe to "mother the past"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration that successfully answers the setup, though the causal pressure is light.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic appropriate for a fable, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of the city's state. However, the causal mechanism between the graffiti map and the citizens' sudden collective action ("kitchens had pried open the vent doors") relies heavily on magical inference rather than dramatized persuasion, slightly softening the climax's logical bite.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure relies on a mechanical list ("On the [number] rise") rather than causal progression, creating a predictable cadence that reduces tension. While the accumulative logic holds, the closure feels tidy and low-stakes, resting on a conceptual reconfiguration without a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure effectively parallels the drift, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing where the "blank lines" become the proof. While the rescue (lights appearing) coincides conveniently with the internal shift, the closure lands with genuine thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The countdown creates effective structural pressure, and the closure (the mural surviving the fall) is resonant and earned. However, the puzzle resolution is too smooth; the coin fits the groove immediately, bypassing the potential for a "try-fail" cycle that would have heightened the narrative drive and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative relies on a lyrical but convenient synchronicity—a childhood phrasebook doodle perfectly matching a deckhand's sketch and the starlings' flight path—to resolve the central puzzle. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, this reliance on "magical coincidence" bypasses causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is linear and coherent, but causality is soft; the protagonist succeeds by following instructions ("prophecies") rather than through ingenuity under pressure. Closure is neat but feels unearned due to the lack of prior resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.0)
    The scope is too broad, summarizing a timeline of months instead of grounding pressure in a single continuous scene or shard. Tension dissipates through montage, and the resolution (arrival) is a logistical outcome rather than a structural turn driven by a decisive choice or realization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality follows a coherent magical-realist logic where mechanical adjustments influence global events. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the machine from a clock of doom to a broadcaster of mercy. The pacing effectively builds from the inciting needle-lean to the climactic lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands effectively as Earned Stasis; the family escapes while the narrator remains trapped by the bargain. The narrative arc is clear and causal, though the resolution via the nut ("Seeds remember the first door") leans heavily on poetic logic rather than established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arc from guilt to insight to resolution is clean, and the closure—a willingness to face lawsuits for the sake of a better design—qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear future cost. The causal link between watching river foam and solving a polymer problem is poetic but relies heavily on a sudden epiphany rather than a struggle with the variables on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ritualistic arc is coherent and the closure—an exchange of personal history for the seed—is legible, though the low-pressure atmosphere makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The arc is cohesive, moving from the inciting delivery of the box to a resonant resolution (the meal). Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the trauma is integrated rather than solved, with the cost transferred to the Chef's sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("The next day... We will meet") rather than dramatized scenes with causal friction. The progression from intent to execution is linear and obstacle-free, leading to a "happy village" resolution that lacks a felt cost or decisive turning point. The pacing rushes through the monumental task of rebuilding infrastructure without narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure works for this lyric mode, building through pulses of memory to a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end. While the closure is legible as an internal rearrangement, the causal mechanism relies entirely on dream logic ("entangled photons," "synaptic plasticity") that borders on magical realism without establishing firm ground rules. The ending feels earned tonally, if not mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, ritualistic structure (entry, action, exit) governed by the "tilt" logic. While the causality is dream-like, it adheres strictly to its own rules, and the closure—a recharging of purpose—lands effectively as a resonant reconfiguration of the archivist's state, even if the stakes remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent under an accumulative lens, moving logically from calibration to execution. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the rain and the hedgehog signifying a restored pulse, though the internal stakes remain somewhat low.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured, moving from arrival to engagement to resolution with clear causality under the textural lens. The closure—a decision to stay and teach based on a reinterpretation of the covenant—qualifies as a valid Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis, though the mechanical resolution (fitting the stone) feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to a resonant closure where the protagonist continues the grandmother's work. However, the resolution relies on a near-magical process that proceeds without setback, resulting in a linear progression that lacks causal friction. The closure is distinct but feels low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fable-like structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a legible &quot;Resonant Reconfiguration&quot; closure where the village accepts the smell for stability. The causal link between the scent and the physical steadying of the bridges relies on dream logic, which works for the genre but softens the mechanical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via the planting of the fused heart—lands effectively. The middle relies on a slightly convenient magical intuition (the arrow pointing because it "remembers"), which softens the causal chain, but the structural integrity remains sound.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is impeccable; the investigation of the past crash directly provides the data needed to solve the present crisis. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the survey tools and the "borrowed authority" of the patch are successfully tested against the wind, fulfilling the 9+ gate for constraint-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean, linear procession of a ritual that achieves a strong Conceptual Repricing closure ("streets learned a softer geometry"). While the causality is magical and lacks twisting pressure, the narrative drive is coherent and the ending lands effectively within the fable's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a defined objective and a complete arc. Closure is decisive—the breach is sealed—and the mechanics of the magic system (flute/weaving) are consistent. The resolution is somewhat linear; the protagonist succeeds on the first correction without a complication that forces a deeper tactical change in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a clean, causal arc where the client request forces the protagonist to exercise their specific skill, leading to a personal revelation. Closure lands with a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the operator’s method is recontextualized from a service to a defense mechanism, accompanied by the visible cosmic cost of a vanishing star. The prompt’s "Between vanishing stars" timeframe is successfully operationalized as a pacing mechanism. The ending feels inevitable yet surprising, satisfying the 9+ closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is a clean, linear ritual that moves efficiently from arrival to departure, achieving closure through Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the narrative functions more as a successful procedure than a dramatic plot; there are no causal twists, unexpected obstacles, or hard choices to drive the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing: "objects witness, and we decide afterward." The logic of the magic system is established early, allowing the climax to function causally. The transition from skepticism to belief is earned through the escalation of the frost images, though the "handprint" resolution borders on convenient literalism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fable logic creates a coherent vessel for the narrative, establishing the "puzzle edges as border" rule effectively. Closure lands well with a resonant connection, though the shift to the brother's perspective is a slight structural convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent mythic structure with a clear beginning, ritualistic middle, and stabilizing resolution. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) effectively lands the transition from chaos to order, the "magic" operates on a soft, dream-logic basis that resolves the plot without distinct causal friction or unexpected complications.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    The investigation follows a clear causal path enabled by the shard, leading directly to the "redirect" revelation without stalling. Closure is secured via Conceptual Repricing: the map is no longer just a chart of space, but a vessel for the survivor's guilt and truth, creating a resonant final state.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    A major causal disconnect undermines the narrative: the lamp failing mid-storm implies an immediate crisis for a lighthouse keeper (shipwrecks), yet the protagonist ignores this to light a candle and exchange letters. This lack of urgency drains the inciting incident of consequence, turning a life-or-death scenario into a low-stakes backdrop for reflection. The closure is thematic rather than a result of the protagonist's actions tackling the established problem.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, effectively building a collage of routine and arrival that culminates in a legible Earned Stasis. However, the inciting incident (the child's arrival) relies on a prophetic coincidence that reduces causal friction, and the closure lands softly without a sharp spike in pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tightly wound; the experiment with the courier validates the method, while the escalation with the widow forces a crisis that demands the "indigo steam" counter-move. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, crystallizing the narrator's new stance as a "lighthouse" with the felt cost of eternal "waiting."

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent "magical logic" where the maintenance of the physical tower equates to witnessing spiritual archives. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the leak stops not by plumbing, but by acknowledging the "minutes," effectively recontextualizing the protagonist's duty and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a strong accumulative drive that successfully pivots into a Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. The transition from gathering ingredients to the realization about the twin and the mirror world (the "ledger omitted a final step") serves as a solid micro-turn. The closure is distinct and earned, solving the problem through a conceptual shift (negotiating with night rather than banishing it).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving smoothly from invitation to a resonant closure ("refusal felt like the gentlest truth") that carries conceptual cost. The situational drive holds well, though the climax—reading books aloud to solve a problem—risks feeling passive and symbolic rather than actively earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative structure works well for this quiet, ritualistic piece, and the closure (planting seeds, committing to return) provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The arrival of the woman feels somewhat convenient—a situational coincidence that eases the narrator's loneliness without requiring a causal effort—but fits the ghost-story mode.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight, moving from routine to inciting incident (the mentor's slide) to a decisive closure. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's role is fundamentally repriced within the world's logic, satisfying the "cost" requirement of the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and the "truce of hush" provides excellent structural constraint that shapes the scene's tension. However, the climax relies on the coincidental timing of the cutpurse’s interference to trigger the lime spill, rather than the protagonist’s psychological manipulation forcing the break directly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure functions as a linear tour with a legible Accumulative drive, but the low causal density makes the progression feel slack. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of prior friction makes the protagonist's final acceptance feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is solid, moving cleanly from the boardwalk to the cave and the lock interaction. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the artist's future. The magical solution (drawing the lock opens it) is accepted within the genre but feels slightly convenient, lacking a harsh Causal snap.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear causal chain leading from the refusal to the discovery and the final strike. The "rattling plank" is a slightly convenient pivot, though the Postmaster's later appearance implies it was a test, mitigating the coincidence. The closure is decisive and reconfigures the city's social contract with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "music changes the antagonist" resolution fits the fable mode. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the antagonists capitulate immediately upon hearing the sound—which softens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration ("workable storm"), earning the ending. The causal mechanism—burning a photograph to fix a magnetic pump reversal—relies on poetic logic that strains strict mechanical plausibility, but the thematic cohesion smooths the leap.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on fable logic where a mechanical lock yields to metaphorical &quot;rhythm,&quot; shifting the genre abruptly away from the established reality. The closure is unearned and overly tidy; the antagonist (the developer) is converted instantly by a single letter without resistance, a sentimental deus ex machina that resolves the external threat without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that obscures causality; the connection between the "dance/writing" and the "liberation" of the names is purely metaphorical, lacking mechanical grounding. The physical reality of the scene is inconsistent (writing with ink underwater, breathing vs. holding breath), which disorients the reader. The resolution arrives via a thematic assertion ("The question was the key") rather than a causal turning point with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent "dream logic" where the causality (whale -> gravity -> memory) is consistent within the established rules. The transition from the whale's ribcage to the underground library is disorienting but thematically apt for a "gravity pocket." Closure is achieved via a strong Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's duty, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Decisive Change via Conceptual Repricing) is legible and structurally sound. The "fix-it" nature of the plot, where a ritual solves a global threat without setbacks or unexpected consequences, limits the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The transition from accumulative summary to the specific rooftop scene is smooth, and the closure—taking the seal—is a decisive, earned action. The momentum drags slightly at the climax due to a block of expository backstory about the architect, which explains the mystery rather than dramatizing it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from intent to resolution, achieving a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the narrator is permanently changed. However, the "resonance structures" mechanism functions too conveniently as a magic wand, resolving the central problem smoothly and lowering the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive lyric structure (Accumulative lens) moving from arrival to ritual to departure. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the blank margin becomes the "honest room"—is legible and resonant. The trajectory is linear and lacks a distinct causal turn, functioning more as a ceremony than a plot with shifting probabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, escalating inquiry that resolves in a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist reweights the concept of "debt" from a burden to a lifeline. Closure is definitive and conceptually priced without relying on external action to force the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear, but the mystery resolution relies on a logic leap: the ghost knowing the specific welding company’s name implies improbable gnosis during the drowning. The ending transitions quickly into fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from expectation to demonstration to realization, with a solid Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure (the sash and the gift). However, the crowd's conversion relies on "magical persuasion" logic common to fables rather than causal pressure, making the turning point feel slightly convenient despite the strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain from observation to deduction is tight, leading to a satisfying "Conceptual Repricing" of the curse. The discovery of the working shredder and generator feels slightly convenient (an "easy find"), which holds the score back from the highest band, but the closure is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the lyric logic holds, the conflict resolves with low friction; the town’s immediate acceptance of the miracle undercuts the established tension, and the setup of "scars" lacks a demonstrated on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story functions as a fable with smooth, dream-like causality, but lacks the dramatic friction required for a scene-based narrative; the climax (the gathering) is summarized rather than dramatized. The closure ("teaching listening") acts as a clear Conceptual Repricing, but the path to it is devoid of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a linear "plan-execute-succeed" structure where the magical element dissolves obstacles without complication or failure. The closure feels unearned because the "cost" of the transformation is absorbed entirely by the magic stone rather than the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic where conflict is resolved by a speech rather than a costly choice. The orientation is clear, but the resolution—the village men accepting the "patient revolution" immediately after the narrator's explanation—lacks causal friction or earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration; the investigator’s refusal to accept the "human error" verdict carries visible professional cost. While the lantern-induced vision is a convenient mechanism to resolve the factual mystery, it fits the story's established atmospheric logic of a city that "exhales" memory.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is solid and the closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing (apology as map), satisfying the prompt's scope. The arc is linear and somewhat predictable, moving smoothly from problem to expert advice to application without significant narrative resistance or unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Throughout the evolution," "By the twenty-ninth dawn") rather than a continuous scene or distinct shards, which violates the short-story scope defaults and dilutes tension. While the closure (the bell ringing/world changing) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the path to it reads like a montage rather than a dramatized crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear inciting incident, investigation, and decisive resolution. The middle section relies on low-resistance beats—the "lie" to the bot functions instantly without complication, and the Sink accepts the numbers on the first try. The closure is a valid Decisive Change that alters the status quo and thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is effective, moving from a magical diagnosis to a pragmatic resolution. The closure is excellent—a Resonant Reconfiguration where a practical plan replaces blame. The vintage store sequence feels slightly rushed as a summary beat, but it serves the causal chain well.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure effectively braids the daily routine of "listening" with the specific incident of the child's rescue and the storm. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the appointment remains but the stance toward it shifts. The "margin of mercy" provides a tangible, earned conceptual repricing of the protagonist's waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, moving from arrival to resolution, but the causality feels fable-like and convenient. The protagonist's advice is accepted without struggle, making the closure—while structurally sound as a Decisive Change—feel unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear ritual structure from dawn preparation to dusk closure. The progression is logical and the "midday wind" provides a necessary, if brief, crisis point that tests their craft. Closure is a successful Earned Stasis—the valley forgets, but they endure—which fits the ritual lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual structure that lacks friction; the townspeople comply immediately, and the "healing" arrives without a dramatic test or credible obstacle. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration (the heavy map case), but the lack of prior struggle makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure—moving through the three cards—builds a coherent lyric logic that leads naturally to the decision to "play" the crystal. Closure is a valid Charged Poise, where the method of testimony is reconfigured, though the causal link between the sounds and his specific aphorisms feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a desire to possess ("bottle it") to an act of navigation ("driftwood markers"). Closure lands well with a Resonant Reconfiguration, as he accepts the cycle of forgetting, though the initial orientation of the "ruined museum" feels somewhat floating and dreamlike.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, with the instrument tuning paralleling the thematic realization about the clock. Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing of "noise" into "speech," though the causality is driven more by poetic logic than hard consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration (death and reconciliation), but the progression is strictly linear with no meaningful obstacles. The causal chain—therapist calls, son arrives, reconciliation occurs—lacks the friction or complexity expected in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Conceptual Repricing, defining "noon" as an agreement with a legible cost paid on the page. The logic of the ritual is established early and followed through causality to a satisfying, hermetic narrative loop that justifies the prompt's structural constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from the discovery of the substitute body to the garden investigation and final confrontation. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to reject the "witch tale" for the truth comes with the felt cost of the impending town clamor. The narrative logic holds the magical realism together without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure works as a mood piece, moving smoothly from grotto to village with legible closure. However, the narrative drive is low-voltage, relying on routine enactment rather than a causal chain of events or obstacles to reach the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration; the ritual burial of the pendant creates a legible "after" state with emotional and symbolic cost. The drive lens holds perfectly, using the environment to pace the transition from estrangement to tentative alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear, ritualistic structure (arrival, gathering, affirmation, departure) that fits the "Accumulative" lens. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, solidifying the artist's pact. However, the progression is linear and low-stakes, with encounters feeling like items on a checklist rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of ritual success without causal complications or reversals. The closure (magic heals everything) lacks the required visible or felt cost; the "remedy" works simply because the story asserts it does, resulting in a "just-so" structure rather than a dramatized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative trajectory, building density through the ritualistic mapping process. The transition from the orchard to the lake is seamless, and the closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration that effectively breaks the established silence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc that successfully transitions into a situational closure. The ending (leaving the timer, storing the jars) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost, fully paying off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure works well for this fable-like mode, building steadily from external observations to internal confrontation. The closure creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, re-contextualizing the narrator's fear from "doom" to "duty" with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure fits the meditative tone, and the closure—refusing to restore the name—provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The narrative arc is slight but coherent, effectively holding the Accumulative lens through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The surreal logic is coherent under a Situational/Accumulative lens, moving from the ascent to the negotiation to the truce. Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the relationship with the past transforms from haunting to collaboration ("leaving tools in my hands"). The causality of the "rope of stories" and the "camera wheel" functions perfectly within the established dream rules.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well, moving from diagnosis to repair to social application with clear logic. The closure is resonant, anchoring the abstract "resurrection" in the concrete arrival of the "Arrivals" roster and the mother.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, but the climax is low-stakes and the closure is delivered via summary ("he finally understood") rather than a demonstrated change in action. The causal link between the bird's arrival and the protagonist's profound realization feels tenuous and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the city) lands clearly. However, the sequence lacks causal snap; obstacles (the lock box, the engineer's resistance) yield immediately to the protagonist's will, reducing the sense of earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent, and the orientation is solid, but the resolution of the central obstacle (the hidden splice) relies on mystical convenience ("trusting rhythm") rather than a causal tactic. The closure lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the journey there lacks sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/lyric drive lens holds well, moving from the client's arrival to a ritualistic investigation and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the absence is not removed but re-contextualized with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setup involving the acoustic tuning of the cradle to the palace's sway is a clever, grounded causal mechanism. However, the resolution relies on a "magic fix" where the hatched creature instantly sings the rust away and reforms the society, bypassing necessary narrative friction and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Narrative drive is low, resembling a ritual enactment rather than a causal chain of resistance and consequence. The closure offers a thematic restatement but lacks a felt cost or a decisive change in status; the "task" is completed without any significant obstacle testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.3)
    The fable logic is consistent, following an accumulative structure of breadcrumb-following and restoration. However, the inciting incident and resolution rely heavily on convenience; the broker's sudden departure upon seeing a vision removes the necessity for a decisive, costly action from the protagonist. Closure is achieved through a reaffirmation of the quest, fitting the mythic mode but lacking a sharp narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exposition to a clearly visualized transit and closure. The structure relies on a fable-like predictability where the conflict dissolves upon contact with the guide's wisdom, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or high-stakes causal pressure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure dissolves from a scenic opening into a prolonged summary ("As the weeks traveled"), which dissipates causal tension and immediacy. While the closure lands as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, the middle section reads more like a montage than a dramatic arc with earned consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure effectively utilizes the "pause" in the pendulum as a suspended moment for reflection and reconfiguration. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the relationship with the fisherman, validating the internal shift. The coincidence of the fisherman waiting at the ridge fits the fable-like logic of the piece without breaking causal immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic rather than causality; the transition from tapestry knots to specific geographic coordinates is tenuous. Crucially, the climax hinges on finding "deeds and letters" inside an antique sovereign case (a pocket-sized coin holder), a physical impossibility that breaks the reality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "predictive modeling" structure works well. The pivotal insight relies heavily on the convenient timing of the kingfisher sighting—a coincidence that mirrors the theme rather than a complication driven by agency. Closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, but the resolution feels smooth and intellectually tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from listening to participation to commitment. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration (the promise and the internal "cadence marker"). While the causality is dreamlike and low-resistance, the internal progression is coherent and the ending lands with a clear conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is solid, moving cleanly from the inciting retrieval of artifacts to the creation process and the gallery climax. Closure is effective: the chair’s movement and the mother’s silent confirmation provide a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned. The causal chain is clear, though the conflict resolution in the first scene removes some tension early on.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is decisive and resonant, landing a specific "Decisive Change" where the cog is used to save the city, silencing the competing narratives. The causal chain is tight, with the tide schedule acting as a ticking clock that forces the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure lands with a coherent resonant image. However, the climax is soft, relying on a prop to bridge a deep divide, and the transition to the performance summarizes the result rather than earning the change through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear Accumulative structure (planting, tending, harvesting, sharing) that leads to a resonant closure. However, causality is soft; obstacles like the "once in a lifetime" timing and the council's ordinance are mentioned but do not exert immediate, high-stakes pressure on the page. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the city restarts. However, the progression lacks friction; the central obstacle (the riddle) is solved instantly, smoothing the tension curve too much.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "rule of three" structure (Accumulative lens) is executed cleanly, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist redefines "aliveness." The closure lands with a felt emotional cost ("weight of tiny vows"), though the linear progression is somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, but the resolution relies on a "magic key" mechanic (the ampoule releasing memory/time) rather than a causal victory earned through struggle. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the Scholar's conversion lowers the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly controlled under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the climb's repetition builds pressure that releases precisely at the rupture. The causal logic of the surreal world holds firm; the "lemmas" affecting the "gear" of the stair feels earned. Closure is exemplary: the sealing of the crack and the resumption of the climb creates a resonant, lasting afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building texture until the neighbor's arrival provides closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the backstory regarding the brush ("traded" vs. "passerby pressed... and vanished") is slightly murky until the reveal. The closure is distinct but lacks a visible cost; the protagonist gains validation without paying a price, which softens the narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central narrative arc of preserving history through baking is inventive and causally tight. However, the resolution of the "murder" subplot relies on a stranger simply arriving ("Then a stranger arrived") to explain the Beekeeper's fate. While this provides emotional closure, it uses coincidence to resolve a tension rather than protagonist agency, slightly weakening the structural integrity of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from a clear objective to a complex complication (the visions) and a decisive closure. The ending lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the narrator refuses the "unbroken mornings" for the "unbroken tide," paying the cost of the "future's iron aftertaste."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, with the "paradox" setup paying off cleanly in the climax to trap the antagonist. The dream logic is rigorous, and the closure (Fear trapped in the photo, narrator escaping) is a clear Decisive Change earned by the protagonist's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong, with the inciting incident (storm) leading naturally to the climax (dubbing the gale). The "net of knives" provides a solid late-stage complication that prevents the victory from feeling too linear, and the closure (silence returning) lands effectively as a resonant reconfiguration of the initial state.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causality is tightly wound; the discovery of the tag and ledger logically propels the protagonist toward the climax. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the frame from a quest for mercy to a submission to measurement, satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and recontextualization on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands effectively as a conceptual repricing of the grandfather's legacy. However, the discovery beat lacks resistance; the locker acts as a convenient container holding every necessary artifact (compass, newspaper, photos) to solve the puzzle instantly, which flattens the investigative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure is legible, with the surveyor entering, working, and leaving in a clear sequence. However, the narrative lacks a causal spine or meaningful turning point; the progression is linear and predictable. Closure is achieved through a thematic statement rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the scene’s reality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a Causal lens, moving efficiently from the inciting opportunity (blackout) to the investigation and final discovery. The closure is a strong example of Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the discovery of the "lowered" city fundamentally alters Ossa's worldview and imposes the burden of secret knowledge. The pacing perfectly matches the "reclaimed stillness" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path where the protagonist’s specific actions (brewing cranes from vapor) force a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The logic of the magic system holds together well, with the prompt’s constraints (shadow, stairs) integrated into the plot’s progression. Closure is effective, offering a distinct shift in the status quo (shadow remains separate but the burden lifts) rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the hunt to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. The ending lands with a legible conceptual cost—the burden of the vigil—that satisfies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, moving from a failed attempt to a Conceptual Repricing of the goal. While the closure is legible, the pivot relies on a convenient algorithmic adjustment ("read silence as a letter") rather than a causal action with significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is solid, moving efficiently from the terrace to the archive and resolution. The "Parliament of Wood" provides a tangible mechanism for the climax, grounding the emotional realization in physical action. Closure is distinct and decisive (burning the lies), though the backstory link relies on a fortuitous past connection rather than purely causal pressure generated in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is legible as Earned Stasis. However, the climax relies on a "soft reset" where a brief monologue and a symbolic object instantly defuse a blood-feud snag, making the resolution feel convenient rather than causally hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, effectively using the "utility poles" setup to resolve the climax. However, the closure leans heavily into "symmetric satisfaction," where the deep internal trauma resolves too neatly and explicitly ("unbroken at last") alongside the external success.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is tight and moves with dream logic that remains coherent; the "clean slate" desire leads directly to the "worst truth" test. The closure is a distinct Decisive Change where the protagonist rejects the initial goal for a new, costlier purpose. The logic of the time-traveler baseball, while whimsical, effectively bridges the gap between the character's past and future responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ritual structure provides a strong causal spine, leading logically to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the relationship is restored but fundamentally altered. The closure is distinct and earned, with the mechanics of the magic system supporting the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is impeccable, using the ritual as a causal spine to move from the domestic inciting incident to the surreal climax. The closure is a high-quality Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist doesn't fix the past but alters her relationship to it with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the setup of the gravity mechanic to the successful opening of the door. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat frictionless application of the protagonist's skills (storytelling, balance) without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing (library vs. nursery), though the cost ("paid in breaths") is physically light.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pivot from a mystical gathering to a rehearsed evacuation drill serves as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the "magic" as competence. The narrative arc is tight, with the arrival of the strangers building effectively toward the situational climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the narrative arc is linear, the resolution relies on a lack of resistance that dissolves tension without cost; the antagonist’s capitulation is unmotivated by prior causality. The ending effectively "conceptual reprices" the fort, but the absence of a felt price or obstacle makes the closure feel like a convenient drift rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is tight and the "soft" magic system operates with consistent internal logic, leading to a Decisive Change that feels earned. The pacing is brisk, bordering on hurried during the climax, but the closure lands with a clear reconfiguration of roles and legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from arrival to ritual to revelation without confusion. However, the causality is dream-like; the connection between the timer, the storm, and the "healed page" works only on a symbolic level, lacking mechanical grounding. The ending arrives smoothly but feels somewhat unearned, as the "masks slipping" promise resolves into a convenient backstory explanation rather than a present-tense confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    The transition from static waiting to kinetic dueling is handled with excellent pacing, and the dream-logic resolution lands effectively. The closure—stepping into a shadow-gate—is a resonant reconfiguration that satisfies the story's surreal premises with genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, building density through action and sensory detail. The closure—a commitment to "practice until dawn"—lands effectively as Earned Stasis. However, the narrative drive is linear and somewhat low-stakes; the threat of the city/siren is acknowledged but dismissed ("no one flinches"), removing the potential for a sharper causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing dream logic to link the film reel to the station's timeline. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the schedule bends, though the "cost" of the journey feels light, with success granted largely by the environment rather than sacrificial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic structure, moving smoothly from the ridge to the hollow to the resolution. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the island's dependence on the narrator shifts. The causality follows dream logic ("hibiscus behaved like archivists"), which works for the genre, though the lack of significant obstacles makes the outcome feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where the lace map dictates the physical path, grounding the surreal premise. The closure is distinct, reweighting the protagonist's relationship to their craft and memory with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final breath across the slide reweights the whole story’s rule-set—data and dust are equivalently readable if attended to patiently. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sweep and traced swirl is a beat that deepens pattern rather than causally reversing plot. Orientation is clean by line 3 (who/where/when). No causal break; the only nit is that the “invite colleagues” moment is summarized, not dramatized, slightly softening the cost immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the annealed window reweights truth from private evidence to communal kiln-of-listening. Causal chain holds: ledger → frost translation → canyon testimony. Orientation anchor (“quiet canyon under stars”) arrives in first sentence; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of heat/glass/frost repetition tightens meaning until the final image refracts it.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silent session layers density until the closing “reciprocal quiet” reweights the stake from loss to shared witness. The mirrored heat-grid tightens pattern by turning breath into legible staves; the tuning-fork lattice marks the decisive reconfiguration where wonder is re-priced without sound. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s drowned choir stays absent, the protagonist’s ears stay broken, yet the conservatory’s frost-lines now “wait for meanings,” proving the world can balance even capsized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: package → descent → lens-mending → address-registry → harbor answer. Each beat tightens options—first only the library can receive the dead, then only his stamp can accredit it. Closure is on-page: the plankton rune ignites, the mantled thing withdraws, and the pier lanterns swap SOS for SOR—Decisive Change with civic cost. Orientation is taught early through tactile descent and kelp map; no disorientation survives.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly gift-runs thicken pattern until the patrol search beat tightens the braid; closure is a Charged Poise—Mara re-hangs the bell, now freighted with communal gratitude and visible risk. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (ridge, frost, sanctions). Cost is unmistakable: “fewer lists, fewer boots, more names without fear” and the bell’s warped faces wobble back at us. One soft spot: the patrol retreat relies on off-stage luck rather than an on-page tactic that forecloses options, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final river-breath rhythm reweights the premise, leaving a palpable cost—ex-loves decanted, bridge lighter, ribs open. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every breath deposits a translucent letter until the image thickens to tipping point. Orientation anchor—“twilight viaduct, camera on parapet”—arrives by line 4; no debt. One micro-turn: glass room → door is on-page and pivotal. No causality breaks; metaphor physics stays consistent inside lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ring’s light rewrites the garden into a “quaking reverie that holds still,” making the cost of endless fade legible. Causal chain intact: each bridge growth is triggered by shard-use; each memory-room is entered through deliberate physical step. Orientation taught early through tactile cues (“roots that walk above streams”) and pattern of recursive return; ambiguity serves the theme, not the writer. No teleporting props; halo fragment state tracks from shard→ring→tongue→light-path.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: wall-collapse roar → cover → piano-bench decode → trapdoor → seed cache → escape via ticket-jam. Each therefore-link narrows options and raises visible price (the chain she must keep wearing as pouch). Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses personal safety to plant futures, chain still ghosting her wrist—cost made legible in the final line. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and the collapsing wall keeps the metronome clock explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every image—drowned orchard, aurora kiln, listening bowl—adds density until the plate’s blank reflection reweights memory itself. The decisive closure is the “smaller than thunder” sound of trust before it breaks, now archived so others can step toward or away; the cost is the inventor’s own forgiveness, felt in the lowering aurora. Orientation is taught immediately by the synesthetic cue. One scaffold loop (“while cells divide”) recurs with payoff, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: density of light-and-flower imagery reweights the dominant stake from stealing to keeping/returning; final “old craft reinterpreted” supplies Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 6; transitions (bouquet → freight door) legible via scent-guided path. No meaningful reversals, but deepening pattern tightens once when moonbeams re-animate blank negatives. Cost visible—“You came because you could hear destiny without believing it”—though price is intellectual rather than visceral, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through density of thaw, glass, and narrated acts until a Charged Poise lands—the row of vessels and returned bookmark reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation is achieved within 50 words; the single-scene default is met. Closure satisfies: the open book and warming room crystallize options for future inquirers while showing Arlen’s private price—his arms shake, the kiln dims to an ember “that watched.”

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cast-cipher, shell hum, and bone-date constellation reweights identity stake to Resonant Reconfiguration on roof. Closure beat—“we unlocked our shared name by speaking both versions”—pays conceptual cost (foreclosed alias, exposed debt). Orientation anchors by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the oracle’s refusal to leave reconfigures the fort into “calm weather” while the courier departs with the booklet—cost is the blood she leaves in the grooves. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence-gap she notes tightens the night’s density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) is vivid by line 3; no causality break. Persistent constraint—the star may die—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s final shine-through reframes the entire looped practice as the origin of thought itself, with the cost of eternal repetition legible in “ice remembers my fingerprints.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop adds density until the last image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—frozen courtyard, twilight, janitor—by line 3. No causal break or lens ambiguity appears.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure = Earned Stasis: lens returned in open glare, registrar accepts permanent vulnerability (“they can decide if the ledgers deserve me”). Causal chain intact: eavesdrop→decode doodles→public reveal→trust restored. Accumulating ticket-images tighten stakes each beat; final image of rippled water reweights all prior mistrust. Cost legible in relinquished control and nightly vigil now unhidden.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the dials steady, the gate stays unlatched, and the cost—public honesty about the marble lie—is paid on-page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the maze’s overnight corridor and the vine’s final lean reconfigure meaning without causal sleight. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“dials I set by the gate”) and never wavers. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the cracked marble reappears exactly where the gardener once planted it.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice steadies, mantas circle twice for every once, and Jae feels forgiven—an undeniable conceptual cost that re-weights time itself. Causal lattice holds: probe → invert fields → corridor refracts → mantas arrive; no off-stage fixes. Orientation anchors (who=Jae-mechanic, where=frost-smoking plateau station, when=migration season) appear within 60 words and remain stable. One meaningful tightening: the lever pull constricts futures to a single breath-wide corridor. Lens ambiguity test waived; pattern is taught early and closure keeps the sideways-time lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via water-bloom imagery; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—silence becomes breathable bridge. Orientation anchor (musician, flooded pit, night) appears by line 3. Causality is lyric, not procedural: blot → score → map → door → baton → silence. Cost is conceptual (house rests), but lacks bodily or emotional price on page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gentian map reweights the lie, physical stance and scale stand-in for absolution, cost legible (“tension leaves my shoulders”). Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (soot, tea, antenna hum) adds density until final crystallization; causality intact, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the narrator turns the valve back open, foreclosing vengeance while accepting the irreducible weight of “normal means.” Causal linkage holds—radio panic → tunnel hum → wheel torque—each step shrinking options until the final quarter-turn. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned train tunnel”) and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural: density of beads, drops, metronome ticks accrues until meaning reframes. Cost is legible in the final image: “I carried the memory of the weight, not as proof, but as a tool.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing at the end: “regenerative silence renews me as it repairs the fragile world” reweights the premise with ecological cost. Causality, however, is loose-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); the flood’s retreat and the wall’s sigh hinge on off-page magic rather than keeper choice, softening the felt price. Disorientation is deliberate and waived, yet closure still depends on imagery of self-renewal rather than a visible forfeiture. Satisfies closure gate with cost, but causal chain remains atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation (where/when/who) nailed by sentence 4, eclipse mechanics seeded early, closure is Charged Poise—Ada’s steadier breath and locket return reconfigure grief from isolating weight to shared vibration. Cost is audible: the guitar/locket hum during totality makes silence communal, foreclosing solitary mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by returning the brass disk and whispering “steady now” to an unseated axis, the historian reweights the world-rule—stories will replace dreams. Cost is palpable in the image of him kneeling in a lopsided silo, volunteering to be the conduit for echoing walls. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence and motif density (bronze quiet, dust, dragons, axis) tighten until meaning tilts rather than plot chains. No orientation debt; place/time are anchored within two sentences and the pattern is taught by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is lyric but traceable: envelope → microdot → fortune-cookie translation → lighthouse projection → town sees its own open secret. Closure is a Conceptual Reprice: the sentence “You already know” reweights years of silence; cost is the townspeople’s inability to keep pretending—felt in their “thank you” shoulders. Orientation is taught by image rather than exposition—neon fizz, salt-white boots—and pays off at the lit-wall reveal. One causality wobble: the agent’s future blank report is predicted but never verified on-page, so the dare’s price is prospective, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the palette becomes a moon-mirror that refuses the whisper an echo, reconfiguring stakes without spectacle. The accumulative/textural lens holds from first frost-loop to final exhalation; each rhetorical layer thickens the quiet rather than pushing plot. Cost is legible in Mara’s single laugh and the street’s fractional straightening—tiny, undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors (chapel, night, Father’s case) appear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist lowers the voice, the lake “opens a seam,” and silence becomes the audible symphony. The accumulative lens holds: each childhood notch reweights the present glass until the final image crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost—composition is replaced by receptive breath.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Charged Poise (“time resumed like a song switching…”) with felt cost—the surrender of flight. Pattern taught early (“generate the path forward through procedural generation”) and paid off when the tablet is sanded smooth, erasing the seed. No orientation debt; spatial choreography on the viaduct is crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the repaired needle hums “like a small animal sleeping,” reweighting the premise—backward listening now propels forward teaching. Causal linkage holds: because she stitches silence, therefore music returns as lucid tide. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“cavern’s keeper, an old drum maker named Oko”). Persistent constraint—the needle newly threaded—shapes the final image and tomorrow’s pedagogy; cost is the fragility of that live filament.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the protagonist forgoes heroics for quiet witness, charts surrendered but integrity preserved, cost legible in the bench left empty and the pigeon now beyond recall. The lateral sidestep behind the fig is a decisive physical act that crystallizes the new stance. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than thriller-causal, but the pressure coil (rogue quarantine vs. personal recorder) tightens neatly; no orientation debt; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank vial silently points toward bearable future, reweighting earlier bankruptcy. Causal chain holds: lentern → UV → etching → recognition → renunciation/schedule. Accumulated motif of light-as-memory tightens in final image. Cost is felt in the tears that irrigate the archive—grief made useful.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“lines that patterned the dust”) and tightens meaningfully: each new footprint reweights the stake until the mirror-chamber reconfigures the protagonist’s past as usable fiber. Closure—braid the past, do not cut it—carries felt cost and crystallizes under starlight. Orientation is immediate; causality remains intact despite lyric pulse. No telegraphing or soft resets; every beat exists to deepen pattern or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added object in the bowl thickens the texture until the final “map drawing itself” reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; the greenhouse’s sunken logic is taught early and pays off when tide breath rattles the ribs of glass. Closure is a Charged Poise: the footprints left on the greenhouse steps crystallize the communal stance—unfinished song as ongoing path—with felt cost (the hush “loosens one more braid”). No causality breaks; even the off-screen rainforest burn is accepted as inherited constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through sensory density and cadence shift rather than external reversals. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Rhea’s “steady eyes” and the static “purring” reconfigures both stake and cost—no more sales tonight, the map has become pulse. Cost is legible in the narrator’s quiet forfeiture of profit and anonymity. Orientation is secure by line 8; transitions are seamless within the single amber room.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated images of tides, music, and quiet ledgers accrue until the final public signing reweights community memory; causality remains soft but coherent. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when anchored by word 30); the single transition (library→roof) is legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when stevedores actually sign, making abstract gratitude concrete; closure lands as Charged Poise—ledger key passed under starlight crystallizes shared duty, felt cost legible. No causal breaks; “mistaken envelope” functions as coincidence that complicates, not resolves, satisfying situational allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard’s mirrored grammar is taught by line 4; each new fragment (baker, diver, seam of fused leaves) increases density until the "repeatable curve" reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the living arbor crystallizes when bodies lean ribs-to-ribs, felt cost visible in the narrator’s promise to "tend as long as the crater keeps shimmering." Persistent constraint—the orchard must be re-leaned whenever forgetting returns—shapes future tactics and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s renunciation (loosening the pendant, letting the echo escape) crystallizes both his art and his ethic on the page and carries audible cost—bells mismatch the hour. Causal lattice holds: every borrowed sigh tightens options until the final release; no beat resets without payment. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via tactile rooftop motion and pendant chill. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence density increases until the pattern ruptures; the rupture itself is the decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the swaying glass-eye pendulum crystallizes longing as a stubborn variable, re-pricing the mathematics of emotion with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (fruit spirals, dripping stalactites) tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and echoed at the threshold exit; no ambiguity persists. Persistent constraint: the rope remains tied to stalactite and pocketed, a literal tether he must henceforth walk with.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: outage → sapphire hush → tape hum → girl summons → notebook recovery → dweller’s chalk-arrow of continued service, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dweller re-commits to invisible stewardship, the cost the ache of nearness forsaken. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten through duct-coordinates; no disorientation penalty applies. The outage is not mere backdrop—it lowers the world’s noise threshold, a causal enabler of the tape’s intelligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I will learn to take apart my certainty…” reconfigures prior stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-elliptical yet coherent; each storm gust deepens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Pattern taught early (dripping trellis) and paid off at close. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl offered up reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure—“walls begin to inhabit themselves with echoes of bread lines”—and the cost is the guide’s obsolescence, felt in her falling behind. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: music densifies, pattern breaks, stakes reweight. One scaffold loop—“overlapping shadows” thrice in four sentences—barely keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by surrendering the valve the archivist redefines “return” as a shared practice, not an archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each staggered tap and gull-cry adds density until the ledger “balances.” Cost is legible in the final image of channels navigated, not voids filled. Only a hair-thin slip: the parade-route tracing on glass risks a twee metaphor, but the erased water immediately re-grounds the gesture in physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mouth returns the punch, declaring “you keep patterns, but they keep you,” and the narrator relinquishes mapped borders. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each punched circle accumulates rails of possibility until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early (“At midnight, I unfolded my maps against the cobblestones”) and pays off when the same cobblestones later “braided into invitations.” Cost is legible in the last line: “the hour reset, and I began anew”—time itself forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density (tile sums, whale spirals, ink geometries) keeps tightening until the silence “pours” and a conceptual re-pricing occurs—grief is not solved but given shared geometry. Closure is the crystallized image of two chairs in an immaterial “room,” a Charged Poise that reweights the premise: reflection itself becomes a forensic act with perpetual custodial cost. Persistent constraint: the keeper must transcribe endlessly; this shapes every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: “storms make doors honest” signals that pressure will accrue by resonance, not causality, and closure obeys that contract. Orientation is waived—the deliberate disorientation (“prismatic escondite,” “auroral shelf”) pays off when the corridor of farewells reconfigures space itself. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: “goodbye is the blueprint of the next room” crystallizes options with conceptual cost, no reset. One causality wobble: Lio’s arrival is leaked off-stage, soft-pedaling the intrigue setup, but the lyric pattern absorbs the bump.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal linkage is flawless: each beat (sink drain, alarm reset, dolly roll) is a because/therefore node that narrows escape options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—ink-stained ledger now indicts the corrupt—visible cost in the narrator’s stained thumbprint on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3; no disorientation remains. Lens holds: every object (ink pot, citrus reek, camera blink) is repurposed as tactical gear under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator embraces endless letter-writing, accepting permanent exile from truth and town; the last line’s steady hand shows the price—life as scribe of phantom timetables. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drafted history adds weight until silence is transmuted into usable past. Orientation is taught lyrically early; no penalty. One shard, single POV, within word range. Hum-to-dawn fade reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s placement reweights the bureaucratic erasure and forces the widow into an unspoken moral reckoning, cost legible in her tremor and the clerk’s retreat. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of gathering fragments, cadence of tides, mirrored oil constellations—culminating in the final image that reconfigures meaning rather than plot. Orientation is clean by line 3, transitions (port → warehouse) are signaled by the mechanic’s dialogue. No causality breaks; however, the early Mosaic-like shuffling of containers/times could feel slightly under-taught for readers needing firmer pattern by 25 % mark, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the riddle unclenches into “kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity,” reweighting every prior hum. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonance thickens atmospheric density until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible in the shell’s cooling blush and the dome’s continuing song—he leaves with the answer but without certainty. No causal breaks; patterned elision (lyric repetitions, echo as character) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: carnival pathways fuse VIP and fish-market, the stone-chip imprint in paint makes the social cost legible, and we exit with options narrowed but not annihilated. The text teaches its mosaic rhythm early ("tents breathed", "sea syllables") so the lyrical elisions never break orientation. One causal seam wobbles: the console realignment beat is summarised rather than shown, muting the "because" that links chip-console-new geography.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pressure mounts through color-coded vials, dwindling minutes, and the literal thinning air. Closure is a Charged Poise—the white vial’s exhale coincides with the moth’s lift, crystallizing the choice to witness rather than save. Cost is legible in “the crater…conspired to make my throat clean and still.” One micro-turn (ochre → white) tightens stakes cleanly; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is tight: damaged trace → must patch → patch requires water-refraction data → fog degrades data → drone hesitation → artisan adds rain-basin mid-beat. Closure is a Decisive Change: the cars couple, the depot “unclenches,” and the hummingbird lands warmed—visible cost shifted from risk to accomplished fact. The lens stays causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the slant. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: condensation pattern teaches geography, each fog-and-sketch tightens stake until final handshake under hill. Closure—Earned Stasis: clerk accepts atlas will breathe differently, cost is perpetual migration. Causality intact: phrasebook → condensation → valve turn; no teleport. Orientation anchored by 89 words.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sandal-scuffs, cistern sighs, and window latches braid into a cadence shift that reweights silence into shared rhythm; closure is the Earned Stasis of ongoing “practice” whose cost is the winter they must keep walking. Causality is lyric, not sequential, yet the before/after is unmistakable once the bell offers its “hand.”

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: vial corked, line singing, rescue possible yet unconfirmed, cost (air/time, temple abandonment) legible in final swim. Accumulative/lyric lens holds: hush, scent, signal braid density across beats until temple recedes “like a star at noon,” re-weighting solitude vs. connectivity. Pattern taught early—perfume as memory antenna—pays off when breath shapes emergency tones through vial. No orientation debt; anchors (lone sender, crippled sub, mythic temple) stable by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image adds density until the lattice + drain moment reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—the hush becomes “a soft animal in a trap,” foreclosing the old reflex to cry wolf. Orientation is delivered obliquely by line 3 but suffices for lyric mode. Cost is legible: “I could steer the current of what came next” shows the price of silence assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bead’s chimed silence reweights the entire orchard’s dark, making the keeper’s future vigil legible as lifelong cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each apparition thickens pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night”); disorientation later pays off when the orchard itself “warms its own dark.” All transitions are legible shard-breaks; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/texture lens: the overlapping sleep-map pattern is taught by 25 % and paid off when the chalk crossings literally open the sluices. Closure is a Conceptual Reprice: the harbor bell rings itself, reweighting “salvage or surrender” to “continual yes.” Cost is legible in the plate’s relinquishment and the tether’s transfer to children. Orientation anchors (tide-empty clock, red canyon) arrive inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt sundial’s shadow “kisses the numeral for home,” crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the lifelong orbit that will tether him to graves and quince trees. Accumulative lens holds—each unearthed fragment layers density until the final image re-weights faith as listening, not owning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. The rib-of-wood beat is the visible price that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    A pure Accumulative/Textural arc: each sensory layer (heat, grit, violin note) tightens the choice until ‘meaning arranges itself like a flock’; the final Charged Poise—hand still holding the envelope—pays every image with felt cost and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each embroidery beat adds density until the cloth literally opens a throat—an undeniable RR/Charged Poise. Causality is lyric but legible: because I listen → because I stitch gaps → because I bleed → therefore the conspiracy exhales. Orientation is taught by line 3 ("cobalt observatory in autumn") and closure reweights the premise—star charts are lies—so the early lyric disorientation pays off. Cost is visible in the final image: the narrator will be blamed, and the candle ash is still warm on the glove.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the path “feels like a listening” re-weights the whole quest; the hinge is not re-opened but shared as breathable space. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each condensation-letter and root-hymn thickens the spiritual medium until stillness is the only executable action. Orientation is taught by sonic beacons (“singing spirits,” “lantern fogs”) and pays off when the listening-path home materializes. Cost is visible—the crescent scar is “a small white door”—and constrains the final tactic: no decision yet, only co-breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coral placed at bedside reconfigures both families’ options while the fog-lowering treaty is felt, not declared. The accumulative lens holds throughout—each smeared signature tightens the shared anxiety pattern until the uncle’s nod makes the reweighting undeniable. Cost is legible in the mother’s sleepless dry eyes and the uncle’s first sleeve-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each projection onto fog thickens pattern until the reversed loop becomes a “fruit wreath” that reweights memory. The closure is a Charged Poise: the circle of film hangs, rooms of light keep revolving, and the artist pockets the fragment—joy’s trail now legible as ribbon, cost felt in the breath the fog “gives back.” Causality is associative, not linear, but the tightening is coherent; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo-densified layer increases stake weight until the final Charged Poise reconfigures meaning (“now you are mapping the air”). Orientation anchors within 60 words; garden, curved wall, dawn time, and mural task are immediately legible. Causality is lyric but coherent: because the nickel rings, pigments wake; because pigments wake, the mason’s daughter appears; because she questions, the narrator confesses fear; because fear is voiced, the wall retains its whisper. Closure cost is unmistakable: the narrator walks away lighter yet unfinished, coin left as price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the auditors’ involuntary performance of ENTER nullifies the tax. Lens is Hybrid—accumulative garden pattern + situational standoff—held cleanly to final image. Causality intact: garden spell → drone mis-read → legal loophole triggered. Cost is legible in the laugh they cannot invoice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tide-echo, shell-glow, postcard reprise deepen pattern toward closure. Orientation is deliberately disorienting yet taught by ~100 words (“gargantuan shell,” “scallop lip”) and pays off at the Charged Poise ending. Earned Stasis lands: the protagonist forecloses the insomnia-vigilance path, accepting vulnerability inside a self-grown reef; cost is the surrender of perpetual alertness. One minor causality wobble: Gardener arrives by “currents of remembered scents,” a soft coincidence that does not materially resolve stakes, so eschews 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical density and pattern-break reweight the stake of remembrance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"I feel permitted to sleep"—after the healed chime rings and the name returns to the world; the cost is the caretaker’s perpetual vigilance, felt in the salt-and-dust taste. Causality is internal but coherent: because the caretaker listens, therefore the name survives. No orientation debt; sky-library rules are taught early and paid off at the rail.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the two stand in the doorway holding the “door held open by joined hands” — the archive’s acoustics now re-tuned from silence to resonance. Cost is legible: the narrator’s vulnerability on paper, Lio’s visible aging, the rewritten promises that can still fail. Causal lens holds: because the narrator composed, therefore Lio could speak; because they co-revise, the archive’s hush loosens. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chain’s catenary becomes the city’s new “readable code,” making fairness mechanical; cost is the machinist’s eternal guardianship, confessed aloud. Causal lattice holds: because lovers salted grief into glue, therefore the residue analysis exposes the sluice scam, therefore the council accepts a song-logged gate. One meaningful tightening—chain sag tracing the mountain’s compromise—reweights stakes under Hybrid lens (causal turn + accumulative image). Orientation is anchored by word 75.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the song rising from the square reweights trust, the cost audible in the chip’s exile. Causal linkage holds—dust-mote map → route choice → Lark’s launch → music returned—without gaps. Orientation is secure by line 4; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of paper/dust/bird imagery tightens into the final chord. The only drag is the soft coincidence of the violinist being ready; because it complicates rather than resolves, it stays within lens tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to hold the distance reweights every prior maze metaphor and leaves the terrace drifting—visible cost is the postponed reunion. Accumulative lens holds: each code-to-grain alignment thickens pattern until the seam yields orchard-shadows. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s maps become “companions” instead of destinations, a conceptual repricing with felt cost—“almost native” carries the ache of almost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silt/constellation/tide imagery tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early—underwater hatch, midnight—and paid off at dawn. One soft spot: the algorithm’s invitation to rest is accepted without foregrounding what is foregone; the cost is implied, not sharp on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions and image-stacking create density that peaks in the “new path wakes like a cat.” Closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguration—paths revise themselves to protect the mountain’s unborn sentence—yet the cost (renouncing the old trail) is asserted, not dramatized through a visible forfeiture on stage, so the reweighting is felt but lighter than required for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: the bishop returned, the coin rent paid, the arcade breathing “a tide that learned restraint.” Causality is lyric but legible—each “diagonal” drawn with chalk or skimming piece tightens options until quiet itself becomes the Decisive Change. The 120-word anchor is secure (performer, tidal arcade, post-act night). Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the applause he needs to survive, trading ego for the janitor’s and girl’s transformed gaze. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens taught early via tide-and-gap motif; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—exile tilts into vocation under obsidian grace, cost legible in “I would walk the coast again” foregone safety. Orientation anchors within 120 words: littoral city, nostalgia ban, twilight garden. One micro-turn: moonstone shift from contraband to nib. No因果 reversal is required; pattern break at “basin’s moon trembled” deepens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atrium will breathe mist like a resting fish, reweighting the premise that value already resides in the mundane. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each ring in the pond, each gull cry, each ferry scar layers density until the final image crystallizes option and cost. Causality runs backward: the decision to rescue the ferry boards is ratified by the stone the boy throws, the pattern the glazier reads, and the pocketed weight that will remind him why he smooths edges. The cost is legible in the last line—“we were its light first”—a conceptual repricing that makes the town’s complicity undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each image (porcelain click, paper-breath, resin hand) tightens the emotional spring. Closure is Charged Poise—box empty but weighted, path recalibrated under stars. Cost legible in final sentence: “calibrating his steps to the heavens.” Orientation anchored by ridge/town lights within 120 words; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the gauge holds at the new angle while tide brushes the spiral—an imagistic RR that reweights prior patterns with undeniable social cost (the method must now be shared). Causality under Accumulative lens: each balloon/pattern is a density increment that finally forces the crystallized stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. The single causal wrinkle: the “chorus of me” arrives as a declarative swell rather than a staged beat, slightly thinning the because/therefore linkage at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the cartographer locks the door, accepts the shawl of echoes, and maps future footfalls rather than corridors—an on-page renunciation with felt weight. Causal chain holds: negative → hopscotch → letter → vow reaffirmed. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of salt grammar, ash-wet pages, and ivy taps keeps tightening until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric shards build density until the final mirror reweights possibility. Orientation is secure by line 5; spatial logic holds beneath the terrace. Closure delivers a Charged Poise—possibilities now “curled into ordinary hours”—with felt cost (the exhausted painter’s smile and the narrator’s unspoken need to keep singing). No causality breaks; drip-paced breathing and song beats tighten stakes without traditional reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bowl of casings left on the terrace becomes a portable memory that reweights the rule-set—“we will be judged by how well our enemies sleep.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added object (olive branch, lockpick, red thread, casing) thickens the ritual density until the final image crystallizes options without forced triumph. Causality is clean—ritual breathing → naming → shared casing → annual return—so the provisional peace breathes with felt cost. Only the Orientation Test waivers: “ancient terrace” and “midsummer” anchor early, but the coastal location and exact chronology tighten only mid-scene, a minor lag that still serves the final tide-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the egg dissolves, speakers chorus, and rain begins—an audible, almost-forgiven reweighting of his drought machine. Causal lens holds: because he emptied the river, the chamber can resonate; because he gives the powder back, the sky answers. Cost is legible in the final image—thin manufactured rain—tying ecological price to personal absolution. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city inhales differently—an undeniable social cost—crystallized when guards’ pikes “sigh into frost.” Causal lattice holds: because she untangles threads → echoes rise → patrol freezes → she escapes → populace awakens. The “between sigh and smile” window is taught early, re-weighted at the end, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no teleporting props or timeline breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the stick passes to the audience, applause is refused, and the meteor hush reweights every prior gig. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than bang-bang, but the pattern is taught early (“we had to reverse the gravity of the strings”) and lands with conceptual cost. The dome’s acoustic property externalizes the ethical inversion, so the final silence is felt, not lectured. One soft spot: the partner’s shouted accusation is off-stage summary; because it seeds the whole crisis, the missing beat keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragile constructions builds toward Charged Poise—lying in green light waiting for “history to answer” reconfigures the stake from private ritual to communal witness. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure cost is oblique but legible: the act of relinquishing control to wind and stillness forecloses any guarantee the names will survive. One hairline slip: the hawk shadow “halt” is announced, not experienced, slightly blunting the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bells now speak the names air must say, foreclosing written record and accepting perpetual cold exposure as price. Causal linkage holds: because the caster forgave himself (off-page promise), he can relinquish control of the names—an earned stasis that crystallizes on the final line. Cost is unmistakable: “heat cooled,” aurora dimmed, the sanctum will keep listening instead of him writing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of braids/aurora/bells tightens to a single cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the disk’s stop and the map’s request reweight his life toward perpetual maintenance without glory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of wires, soot, water rivulets—until the final cadence shift where “the unknown will note my thrift” makes the cost social and eternal. Causality is lyric but intact: each schematic sum leads to the bead, the urn, the pledge. Cost is legible in the final image of brushing footprints backward, sealing the vow into anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative-textural lens holds: silence, water-ripple floors, and the mute cylinder pin accrue longing until the missing note vibrates Rell’s ribs—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; the sanctuary’s shifting grace bends space so Rell can walk rows of exhaled breath, a spatial metaphor that reweights blame into forgiveness. The broken pin never repairs, so the conceptual cost—living with a quiet compass—remains legible in the final image. Orientation is taught early (“sound refuses to be born”) and waived; the pattern pays off when silence becomes the lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each mirrored corridor breath thickens pattern until a cadence shift (the orchard exhales) reweights the stake. The closure is a Charged Poise: the dream settles into the starless glint, the orchard rows loosen, and the city touches its orchard again—conceptual cost legible as permanent softening of boundary. Orientation is taught by image-line #3 (“centuries of thick fog”) and paid off in the final “seam bright as glass mountains,” waiving any penalty. No causal break; broken sextant and frostlight angles are presence-tracked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: each micro-beat (ribbon touch, bell-ring, vow-shed) layers density until the final “readable rustle” re-weights the broken contract. Causality holds: breach → thickened vows → ritual pruning → breathable orchard; no off-stage fixes. Orientation is complete before 120 w; space stays coherent from choir loft to ribbed canopy. Closure is a Charged Poise: bell still swaying, tin unopened, cost—father must keep waiting—is explicit in the image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: each fruit tasted layers density rather than causal dominoes, and the final image—the unfinished face pressed into bark—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he forecloses ordinary curation to become the between’s living archive. Orientation is taught by word 80; no anchors drift. The single transition (pod → grove) is legible, and closure reweights the premise under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library opens only after mistakes are spoken kindly, re-weighting the premise from acquisition to acceptance of error. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of absences, gaps, seeds—culminating in the seeds sprouting questions. Causality is lyric-sharded yet coherent; however, the apprentice rescue is accomplished off-stage via “conjugations like ladders,” a leap whose mechanics are elided, not earned. Still, the final image of un-pressed leaves exhuming neglected futures carries undeniable cost under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s silence re-weights identity without naming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of mirrored returns (card, soil, carousel) tightens meaning rather than plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate fog-disorientation that pays off in the final hush. Cost is felt in the unclasping of the discoverer-self, though lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the merged ledger reweights campus history, felt cost is the draft of unborn scholarships now breathing again. Causal lens holds throughout—each rope re-braid brightens/dims the door because/therefore—no leakage. Persistent constraint: the doorway is gone, the archivist must resume cataloguing with only a calmer heart, the price of service. Orientation anchor (who/where) lands by line 3; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush petal closes, leaving a persistent constraint—“use this when the world speaks too hard.” Cost is legible in the milk-to-water glow thinning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of echo-curling seeds taught early, cadence shift at end. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the harmonic caves…”), so no penalty; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam’s “exhaled” ribbon reconfigures the wasteland into a community of shared music; cost is the custodian’s surrender of solitary proof. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each star-etched pane, shard-cut silence, and traveler’s map layers density until the final alignment reweights belonging. Causality is lyric but legible: shard fits prism because silence was always the seam light needed. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by the second sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early—each donation is a bead on a string—and lands a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator’s personal memory is accepted, reweighting the archive’s rule-set: the cost is the admission that the keeper must also be catalogued. Causality is internal but legible; the only drag is a brief orientation haze around “when fog becomes solid,” yet the metaphor pays off in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: final braid of ash-soot and chant reweights the “gravity of hopelessness” without sermon. Causal chain: mosaic-note → tool-finding → salt recipe → fused cord → sky Reply holds because each step disables retreat (rag knot tied again = cost). Cost is visible in keeper’s straightened spine and flowering walls—an undeniable conceptual repricing. Lens (Causal) holds start-to-finish; orientation anchored by dusk arrival inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pause itself becomes the tightening unit; star-fed hinges reweight stakes without causal plot turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the “Yes” extends the coastline into shared inland territory; cost is the foreseeable bruise of adaptation. Orientation is immediate: grotto, lantern, ankles in tide within 50 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the father softens bunker plans into arches after tasting gilded hush—cost is the foreclosing of pure safety in favour of welcoming space. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted silence layers density until the shared sample reweights what “safe” means. Orientation is taught early by inverted-gravity rule; no teleporting props. One minor causality gap: how the doll stores breath is asserted, not demonstrated, but doesn’t break the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the car slows to cradle-drift, breathing syncs with city rustle, silence is re-weighted from cliff to blanket. The operating lens is Accumulative/Textural—each hush-thread (train echo, felt-wrapped scales, velvet pylons) layers density until the final breath-cadence reconfigures meaning. Anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 40 words; no orientation debt. The singer-memory cue at mid-story is the concrete trigger that authorizes the reflective block, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne’s empty seat and pastel-cooled waterfall reweight power as rotating stewardship, with visible cost—monarchical certainty forsaken. Causal chain holds: ruby flake → mural bridge → hatch → duet pulse, each step narrowing options under a ticking sunrise clock. Orientation anchors within 120 words—Halo Nine, monarch-algorithm, river cursor—no disorientation persists. One meaningful tightening: sunrise deadline forces the final choice inside the pump-house chamber; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization; closure is Earned Stasis—stepping aside forecloses mentorship with visible fatigue. Orientation taught by disorientation: star-bowl, door-without-house pattern set <120 words and paid off when the girl crosses alone. One shard, single POV, dominant stake legible: keep the threshold open by teaching others to breathe their smoke. Cost: the ashes reread in the final line prove the bridge-burn price persists.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signed console and edible diamonds reweight “promise” from scam logic to communal value, cost legible in the donated harvest. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—lyric repetitions of pressure, glow, breath tighten the cadence until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: each text-command is obeyed, tightening the chamber until the caps crystallize; no coin flip resolves the stake. The bolt’s threaded “mouth” is teleported in without prior spatial map, a minor orientation wobble that does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “build bread ovens where its pillars once cast shade” reweights the dynastic rule-set with unmistakable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the ash-letters accumulate meaning via sonic pattern until the final cadence reconfigures stakes. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sepia reading room of my inheritance”). Every beat tightens the same stake—end the line to spare the field—until the final image forecloses rebuilding the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every image layer (constellation-rooted glass, fossilized pollen slab, mercury sap) tightens the same stake—possibility vs. singular choice. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the kernel on tongue rewrites the rule-set—he exits the greenhouse already living an unwritten morning. Causality is lyrical but legible: script cues → ladder → kernel → new vow. Cost is legible in the line “armor abandoned to rust into reeds” projected inside the reel of mornings. No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive by line 3 and evolve with the greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the envelope “For Micah When We Meet Again” reconfigures the unknown from cavern to corridor, cost felt in the archivist’s reflection pressed to the night window. Causality is strict: dust prints → button → folder → addendum → envelope, each because/therefore link tightening options. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern taught by 25 % and paid off. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear inside 120 words and serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon signal is live, captions already “sweating,” Mara’s hum a measured new threshold—cost is the irreversible exposure she welcomes. Causal chain (key → hinge → broadcast) holds without gaps; the puddle-map is taught as mystical but rule-consistent. One soft ellipsis—how the museum circuit actually links—doesn’t break legibility. Lens: Causal, held to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is left open, the city spared, the oath intact, and the price—the eternal return to the grotto, the memory that cannot finish—is legible in the final image of the mist withdrawing. Accumulative lens holds: each condensation line, note, and echo thickens the texture until the last lullaby dissolves the sentence. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors by line 3 and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the decoded sentence reweights the entire arbor-dialogue, costing the sorter their former certainty and loaned height. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern taught early via leaf-stacks and monuments, cadence deepening until ash sifts like sugar. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the need to keep ears growing—shapes the final image and future duty.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the new "clock of water" braids cascade and compass, reweighting the premise—planning as friendship, not cage. Every beat obeys a tight because/therefore linkage (compass tug → alley → hatch → cataract → water-clock) under a Causal lens; the price—renouncing certainty—is legible in the final line. No teleporting props; journal and key pay off set-ups. High-band gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coin, now alloyed with hair and button, literalises the weight of names and settles the stone debt. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each weighing iteration thickens the pattern rather than narrows options. The lens holds, but the middle sags slightly with repeated “again I tested” loops that delay the single meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the woman’s laughter climbs “a crooked ladder toward a clearing,” reweighting the gorge’s rule-set and leaving the collector outside with “modestly fearless breath”—a visible, felt cost of exclusion under the Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern is taught early, anchors clear by line 5, and the final image crystallizes options without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fluorescent leaf adds density until the geometry of mercy crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the strap on the branch reconfigures future options with conceptual cost visible in “I am sworn not to exceed again.” Orientation waivers apply: delayed anchoring is taught by the mask strap cue and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the scrap of sailcloth tied to the frame makes the painted dusk quit “drowning in anonymity.” Cost is legible in the painter’s lowered eyes and the market’s brightening; the lens shard’s coordinates (tar, iron, hush) reweight the whole premise under an Accumulative lens. Pattern is taught early (“I translate what skylines say to shadows”) and paid off in the final breath. No orientation debt; causality of naming = re-naming holds.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: winding the mainspring backward is a Decisive Change that releases the ghosts and reweights the ledger; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—dust patterns, cracked paint, and coiled time build density until the final cadence shift; cost is legible in “the ticket office seemed lighter by the weight it lost,” a Conceptual Repricing felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the library flinches back into wobbling life, sand still falling inside the circle, proving eternity was tasted and rejected because it weighs more than buoyancy—an earned Charged Poise. The accumulative/textural lens is held throughout: each printed clause adds density that reweights the stake of survivable asymmetry, and the final image of the whisper retreating into its bottle re-prices the whole premise. Orientation is anchored by glass apples/tombs and the press under boughs within the first 60 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the council’s vote to “revise the archive as ornament” publicly revalues labor over bloodline, a social cost Ledger feels as his laughter returns “muffled, perplexed, and aging.” Causal chain holds: shard song → public readings → crowds bring objects → council spectacle → archive shift; each because/therefore advances options. Early orientation is swift—asteroid, visible time, narrator’s disgraced status by line 3. No prop or motive teleports; mirrors stay covered, shard stays audible, antagonist stays present until the muffled laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: because he despises dishonesty, he elicits the watchman’s truth; because he confesses, the chamber accepts; therefore he can trade his shadow. The closure beat—shadow stepping away, light returning—lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost. Mosaic structure is taught early via named shards and floor glyphs, transitions legible. Minor loop: “mending what isn’t torn” is repeated four times without new causal payload, blunting final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon returns the boots, refusing explanatory logic, and the narrator accepts the hush—cost is the forfeiture of certainty and the compass itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each psychometry flash thickens the pattern of industrial guilt / filial loss until the water’s silence reprices it. No orientation debt; who/where/when are legible by line 10. Causality is soft—coincidence of seam-opening—but fits the situational pressure rule. The final image crystallizes options without emotional over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the slide’s projected “braiding of hands” is the pattern-break that reweights stakes, turning salvage into reciprocal gate-building. Closure lands as Charged Poise—timber gate humming with latent passage—whose conceptual cost (perpetual wandering in exchange for kinship) is legible in the final paragraph. No orientation debt; drift from GPS failure to arch is anchored by sensorial triangulation within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the amber pavilion mural re-weights night as “the gentlest daylight,” undeniable conceptual cost paid in public exposure and private lineage. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each seasonal layer of pigment and postcard scent thickens meaning until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation anchors (cathedral loft, winter→autumn timeline) appear by line 60, well inside the 120-word grace window. Causality remains intact: every because/therefore linkage (grandmother’s sketch → artist’s window study → scent-guided draft → mural panel) tightens toward the culminating reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the surf “reads aloud” the names, converting private archival labor into public, irreversible speech—cost is the narrator’s half-trapped state and the city’s un-mute future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beach-arranged shard thickens the pattern until the lagoon mirrors it, reweighting the stake from private grief to communal accountability. Causality is circular yet legible—grandmother hands over what the narrator already found—time as “circular affidavit” pays off rather than explains. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within 30 words and the zeppelin library is immediately tethered to action.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the bell rings, people sweep, the bottle’s unheard ticking certifies that a non-wish civilization has begun; the cost is the perpetual rehearsal Iria embraces. Causality holds: each plan is tested against the bottle’s glass, then released, so the final image is earned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of lanterns, maps, shells, bell, and bottle accrete until the shift from memory to shared labor is undeniable. One drift: “light the bell” is an impossible phrase that momentarily breaks physical logic, but the metaphor is brief and does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator folds the prophecy away, accepting unarchived mercy, a path foreclosed with legible cost (“the future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath”). Causality is lyric-accumulative: the cylinder memory → basin experiment → prophecy → refusal, each beat tightening agency. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; pattern taught early via “method, not magic.” No orientation debt; space/time anchors bloom by line 10. Wax shaving and orchard both charge the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oak cap planted in loam reweights the entire inheritance rule-set—keepership is now stewardship that must be passed on. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-turn causal, but the pattern is taught early (“the principle of vortex inheritance”) and paid off in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the single shard holds.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s single clear vowel physically splits the storm corridor, reconfiguring both meteorology and civic posture under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is implied rather than linear—listening accumulates atmospheric data and social trust until the microclimate itself “sidles away as if embarrassed.” The cost is legible in the valley station’s incredulity and the ferryman’s absent geese—an auditory debt that will be paid tomorrow. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) are settled by line 10; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor streak thickens the station’s sentience and the narrator’s transparency; the midnight power-fail provides the single tightening that reweights stillness into shared kinship; closure is the green flare + slowed heartbeat—a Charged Poise with conceptual cost, though the causal linkage is more lyrical than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural pattern is taught immediately—ghosts visible, box ritual, noon light—and the final image reweights the premise: the archive becomes a kiln that softens grief rather than merely storing it. Cost is legible in the queen’s blue stripe left hanging, a conceptual repricing that makes the covenant’s price felt without exposition. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the closure unit is clean and charged under the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule’s hinge “remembered its calling,” the urn fragment patches the seam, and the narrator’s rediscovered childhood cricket-time reweights the premise—time is no longer measured but walked. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of numeric time and in the communal labor of walking letters; the final boot-posting extends the method, showing the path foreclosed to old clocks. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale breadcrumb thickens texture until the final ribbon-unrolling breath. Orientation is taught early via sensory offsets (“clocks coughed colors”), waived penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the raft drifts toward the vanished kite, reweighting loss into collaborative attention; cost is felt in the boy’s empty spool and the poet’s ink left to silence. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of “woven dawns” braided from frays culminates in the final image without causal sleight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s “slow chord” reconfigures the caretaker’s death from exile into continuity. Causal chain intact: six-month sentence → copper grammar → otter handshake → mineral silence, each step narrowing breath and widening pattern. The cost is legible in the final copper circle and the diary relinquished to roots. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first mineral hum to last woven map.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the window widens intention, declaring “home is a rate constant,” a legible before/after at felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via rainwater, dust, scent, until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and mosaic shards taught by 25% mark.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the submerged concord is re-instantiated each dusk, the cost the perpetual labor of carrying tomorrow’s empty pods. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeding, bird-grammar, and language-translation tightens cadence until the final lattice-flower image reweights the whole harbor. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure; no causality break. Persistent constraint—reef death—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystalline Charged Poise: the copper crow’s lattice of syllables plus the sister’s laugh rewire the meaning of distance under the autumn light, cost felt in the snapped-shut dark that follows. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each object (leaf, cylinder, relay) layers sensory density until the final projection of color through wax triggers the tower; no gaps, no teleport. Orientation anchor (“Sluice… cracked wasteland”) is clear inside 120 words; single transition from settlement to scarecrow site is legible. Persistent constraint—the leaf’s limited dusk window—shapes the entire timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sketch-dated blackout and candle-breath crystallize a new personal axis whose cost is the permanent social chill; the compass rose is re-veined from ornament to “vein of intention.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each slow shell of perception thickens the stake until the only viable navigation is inward. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—the stretched temporal deck—shapes every tactical decision to keep drawing instead of petitioning for forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chessboard inhales and expels the sky’s wrongness as starlings, mountains return “late but apologizing,” and the protagonist accepts a silence inside the lid as payment—an unmistakable conceptual cost that reweights earlier swaps. Causal lattice holds: each piece-exchange narrows weather-options until the queen-letter (pre-natal wind writing) forces the final swap; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation is taught by 60 words (“icebound spire above the clouds when the sky is wrong”) and ambiguity about literal oceans-in-sky later pays off by showing the dissonance being repaired. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through sensory density (blue-patient lamps, thawwater moan) until cadence shift at the bell releases accumulated guilt into tuned wind.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gallery’s “corridor full of legible silence” reweights memory vs. spectacle, cost felt in the vanishing act the narrator embraces. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—echoes, footprints, lantern swings accrue until silence completes the final word. Orientation is taught early: “interregnum,” “whispering gallery,” “chessboard” appear within 60 words, waiving anchor debt. One transition (square rumor → gallery hush) is legible; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard jars re-assemble, the mountain exhales, and “home” is re-defined as daily vocal practice—cost is the lifelong labor of voicing shame. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeding/feather/stonetext builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation taught by line 3 (“bookstore climbed the mountain”) and paid off when shelves realign into question-mark corridor. No causality breaks; substitution cycle is motivated by seer’s rule.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the village exhales in increments while the protagonist accepts a lifelong partial penance; cost is felt in the image of the still-pigeons he must forever carry. Causal lattice holds: each thread-pull tightens options under the “because/therefore” lens—wrong tug tastes ash, right tug frees a droplet. Orientation is taught early (time-frozen square by line 3) and pays off in the fountain’s first overflow. One persistent constraint—the frozen pigeons—shapes the final image and guarantees the price keeps working on him.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the community’s collective pigment gift rewrites the ritual rule-set on the page (“the ritual had already arrived ahead”) and the artist’s forfeiture of the gold morning light is the felt cost. Causal chain holds: because he questions the old price, he invites braiding, which forces the canyon to reset terms, therefore he pays double. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with who-where-when; no ambiguity at end. One micro-turn—child’s chant disperses the debt—satisfies the single tightening required.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the engine’s bell-grammar reweights the narrator’s options, crystallizing Mira’s pattern-of-choosing without delivering her back. The cost—acceptance of permanent absence—is legible in the golden solder that “flicker like small exclamations the sea cannot dissolve.” The accumulative/textural lens holds: each dunk, caliper-kiss, and bell-hum layers density until the final cadence shift. No causality break; the statue’s pockmarks and engine ribs were set up early and pay off as the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drawn harbor-under-the-quay is relinquished, reweighting the rule-set so the sea—not the artist—signs the work. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via tidal imagery until the final breath-curve reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the cracked mirror left broken—carries visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because mentor sleeps, therefore narrator tests whisper; because scent and hum are sent, therefore freighter angles in, horn humbled—cost is the mentor’s thumped arrival and the captain’s two-finger salute that acknowledges the whispered map. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options reconfigured, tenderness now a navigable seam. Tiny slip: “rinsed and almost forgiving” is an early abstraction before pressure grounds it; −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the censer foot and needle fuse into a compass that reweights loss from destination to traveling-with; the because/therefore chain holds—each midnight call tightens the build, the full moon locks the shape, the inland pointing forecloses retreat—though a faint lens wobble between causal and accumulative never quite declares itself until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard steadies, the eye holds communal pain, and the narrator accepts perpetual foraging under persistent truth—cost is felt in the final image. Causal chain holds: smuggle → patrol interrogation → occlusion tactic → communal ritual → stasis with lingering warmth. Orientation is swift; only the patrol’s off-stage withdrawal is a mild ellipsis, but it serves the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern code answers the stranger’s silence, re-weighting the entire chain of notches and knocks. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (opal sheen, salt ledger, flower key) tightens the emotional cost until the final light-signal. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“At nautical twilight the dock…”). No teleporting props; the flower’s fit into the notch is prepared by earlier tactile rehearsal.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hallway of mirrors dissolves into remembered leg-angle, ant-bridge crossed, creek water gritty but not fatal—felt cost on the page. Causal chain: promise note → ant path → cavern → matrix inserted/removed → step into overlap—each because/therefore tight. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) locked by line 5; no penalty. No lens ambiguity; causal pattern taught early and held to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine holds: crown abandoned → ridge → grotto → integration, each step triggered by dream hunger. Orientation is swift (“After the final warning tolled…”) and the lens is lyrical-accumulative: images layer rather than reverse. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she wakes her stone self and forfeits the unblemished reign—yet the price is more atmospheric than concrete (no cut hand, no kingdom shown in collapse). The wanderer’s axiom-heavy dialogue sometimes substitutes for on-page turn mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each return to the spiral deepens density rather than re-plots causality. Closure is a Charged Poise—the thimble of weighted clarity reconfigures what a second can carry, with conceptual cost legible in “presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry.” Orientation is taught lyrically by line 3, waiving any anchor penalty. No loop or teleport; the forge trees, ash crownlets, and shell track spatially across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dates snap into switchback order across the sky-scroll, making endings and beginnings share bitter coffee—felt cost is the unfixable self-scatter. Causal chain holds: envy → letters climb → syllable released → map re-lanes → patrol resumes under jaded wonder. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“mountain ranger cabin”), obviating the 120-word test. Lens—Accumulative/Textural—stays coherent as density, not plot turns, reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each droplet, breath-fog, and screw-thread layers density until the crack in time is literally bridged by the clamp-screw—an on-page Conceptual Repricing that reweights “holding” from metal mechanic to birth coach. Causality is lyric, not linear, yet the pattern is taught early (water clocks murmur like cautious throats) and paid off in the final audio-text of water-and-laughter. Orientation is swift: inside 120 words we know who, where, when, and the missing sense. Closure carries undeniable cost: the narrator’s solitude is deepened by the father’s departure and the shop’s open door—time will keep arriving unannounced.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: the held-breath minute expires as she drinks the self-forged runes, foreclosing the old shame with felt lung-burn cost. Causal chain (ritual rule → breath window → rune inscription → ingestion) holds without ellipsis breaks; the lens is Situational pressure crystallizing stance. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—breath as sandglass—shapes every tactic; final image reweights prior scars as legible alphabet inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the stylus writes “Play,” the narrator obeys, and the static-nocturne reconfigures both their stakes—Mara’s ghost gains a voice, the narrator loses the right to keep stalling. Cost is legible in the same instant: the perfume is spent, the orchard still doomed, the apology irreversible. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, jasmine, iron filings) tightens the emotional vise until the final image releases it into music. No因果 leaps—every beat is triggered by the last, even the stalled truck outside.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each spiral circuit thickens meaning-density until the final Charged Poise re-weights the premise. Orientation is taught by line 3; the hush-body metaphor signals pattern. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“Be listening” forever surrenders the authority to speak last.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: each drip-lag tightens options until the protagonist chooses to label the lag a “boundary event” rather than error, a decisive change with felt cost (blood on key, foregone overtime). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure lands on the page—“wrote a note…should remain uncorrected”—with persistent constraint: the station now floats on un-corrected time. No outline-and-then sequencing; every beat is because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara lays the pointer in her palm “light as a falling permission,” reweighting security from barrier to lattice. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, each pulse of bioluminescence tightens the pattern until the final image reconfigures stakes without burning the night. Cost is legible—“she unhooked a tight dress stitched around the heart”—and persistent constraint (the rig now off) shapes future vigilance. Causality holds: tension accumulates through spore-waves, cat-passage, steam hiss, then releases into breathable alertness.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lantern lens reframes raindrops as “discrete coins,” making the father’s creed usable for stewardship, not theater—a visible cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but legible: subway scrawls → library coordinates → lantern note, each step a taught pattern that reweights the stake. Orientation anchor (“rainwashed library at midsummer”) arrives within 30 words; no drift. Final image of “numbered squares” receding re-threads the gambling grid into a lived map, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the child’s rescue reconfigures the meaning of Mara’s self-denial, turning her isolation into the very pivot that lets beginnings hatch. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density spikes when the third rail arcs and the disc vibrates untouched, tightening the stake of listening versus intervening. Persistent constraint: Mara’s vow of non-entry shapes every tactical choice and charges the final image of her solitary stance. Cost is unmistakable in the line “she let them go upstairs together” while she remains below.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the reopened locket reweights the entire covenant via recovered proximities; cost is the archivist’s exile from their dyad and the salted page—felt on page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sensory cascade to final “patient ledger of foam.” Orientation anchored by line 4, no late lens break. 0.3 off because “footsteps at landward end” coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve—could feel engineered; still, it pays off the thrift/rust image seeded early.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the moon rock passed to the child crystallizes the “cure” as a living relay, not a delivery. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—rumor, soup, postcards accrue until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causality is lyrical, not linear, yet each beat adds density; the midnight trolley arrives as a credible materialization of accumulated goodwill. The ending’s cost is palpable: the logistician erases their name, trading identity for system, a sacrifice legible only because the pattern was taught.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ring falls silent, re-weighting grief from coastline to marrow-map, cost legible in the finger-ache and the new stillpoint carried outward. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of musical notes, temperature shifts, lichen vowels—tightening until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early via sonic/tactile cues; no ambiguity at end; lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of listening → translating → editing history that tightens through cadence and image rather than because/therefore plot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dated seed-shipment manifest reweights the entire past, making the cost of edited history legible. Orientation is clear by line 10; no ambiguity or teleporting facts. The single causal micro-turn—the scrap becoming a timeline—feels lightly motivated but sufficient under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: cadence and image density tighten until the single bell-swing deepens the stake—silence mapped becomes silence released. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera’s empty click and the tide-washed map reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is lyric-taught from line 1, so the early shimmer is waived; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seeds rewrite the ledger of gratitude across the floor, reframing the arson as primer, ruin as vow kept—cost felt in “heart hammering” and “wholly undone.” Causal lens holds: because I torched the library, therefore the archive’s paint loosens, allowing the new text to emerge. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“beneath the dunes”). No artifact muddles the final image; the living sentence lands with undeniable conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Driven by an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern early—sound as spatial key—and tightens through cadence shifts rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crack widens, Mira steps onto the bridge, and the monitors adopt their rhythm—an undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (donor lives now housed inside them). Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“research wing”), waiving any penalty. No plot amnesia; every metaphoric leap is pre-signed by the garden’s acoustic rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: storm → compass failure → Ivo’s whisper method → courier release. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard silence is a full cup that reconfigures power. Cost is felt when Rade’s violet face surrenders to stillness—authority is quietly repriced. The maps-as-lung image teaches the pattern early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through mirrored light, shutter patterns, and repeated “spiralingly calm” cadence rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator cups a “small star,” poised to ferry light elsewhere; cost is the ongoing, fragile responsibility he now bears. Anchor who/where/when lands by line 4 (cobalt dock, after rain, I/him). The final image reweights earlier motifs—mirror, water, stars—into a single charged stance. No causality breaks; ellipsis (how the brother’s refusal is sensed) is justified by the lyric contract taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the town slows, the board remains unfinished, the grotto keeps its magnetic silence—cost is the forfeiture of decisive victory. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of window tableaux + grotto ritual reweights the stake from "win" to "wonder." Orientation clear by line 4 ("Stone benches ringed the cobalt library"). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early ("synchronized window displays"). The final image of needles allowed to waver is the exact beat where conceptual cost becomes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric repetitions of “disappearing” vs. “holding” tighten until the narrator’s spoken true name reweights the entire fog-staircase image. Closure is a Charged Poise—the island thickens, the whale presence offshore crystallizes a new social contract, cost felt in the exposed self-naming. Causality is poetic but legible: scrimshaw activates → whale call → speaker’s naming → island stabilizes. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (dock cleats, tide step, sublittoral fringe) are clear within first 120 words. Persistent constraint: the post-Pacification rule that bodies can only be touched by consent, which shapes the entire public ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final refusal to emit mandated joy, held in the remade hush, forecloses compliance forever. Causal chain intact: each narrated chore increases surveillance tension → whittling crafts unsanctioned silence → child’s gesture externalizes the stance → camera blank face = irreversible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of performed zest vs. private hush deepens until final image reweights stakes. Cost is legible: “I felt the familiar vacancy where victory should sit” + turbines restart while inside “something finally did not.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widening doorway and shared breath reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (“we go through”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through echoing hums, fogged glass, and thawing ice—yet the final image crystallizes stakes cleanly. Orientation is swift; who/where/when anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: reed image, plant-code, and furnace heat layer until the final cadence reweights “imperfection” as audible rhythm. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken-goblet bell and “awakenings for everyone” crystallize a communal stance whose cost is the forfeiture of perfect clarity. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; pattern is taught early (plant lexicon) and paid off in the bell/iris reprise. One scaffold tic—“after the phoenix rises” repeated thrice—slightly dulls the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the braid-image reweights the entire ritual under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final paragraph crystallizes options—“the pilgrimage will travel tomorrow… I will follow”—with felt cost of perpetual itinerancy. Persistent constraint: the carbide-lens moonlight clings to skin, a portable burden. No causality breaks; every bell echo is earned by prior tactile beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “curtains of intention” thickens across shards until final Charged Poise. Closure—lily still glowing from fingerprints—offers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: narrator commits to perpetual witness. Orientation clear by line 4 (“timeless observatory”), no penalty. One minor scaffold: “I did not cry; I clicked…” could compress, but causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the tape becomes “a ribbon festival” that reweights inherited mystery into communal song; cost is felt in the unspoken admission that people remain scattered yet still choired. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of “multiply paths” taught early, returns in every client vignette, and tightens through final image without causal contradiction. Orientation locked inside 120 words; no props teleport; only minor scaffold is the repeated “she taught me” refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the archive’s morphing architecture and cascading images tighten the stake in “permissions to feel.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”to pursue forbidden knowledge is to love responsibly”—with undeniable social cost. The only minor drag is the late introduction of the bronze child who delivers the compass; because she appears after midpoint, causality feels slightly spoon-fed rather than earned in sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s luminous regret is poured literally into the orchard soil, branding the sky with her name as payment—felt cost made undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the library’s jealous vines, sighing shelves, and petal-applause cadence tighten until blossoming index renames the clouds. The single-scene window is anchored by line 3 (“In the blooming library above clouds”), eliminating orientation risk.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single causal scene: con fallout → amputation → public confession; each beat tightens because/therefore linkage. Closure is Decisive Change: tail removed, shelter stripped to honesty, narrator’s stance irrevocably shifted; cost is palpable in the tiny relic on the shelf. Orientation locked by line 3; no lens drift. Minor glitch: “quietly vivid” brochures repeat without reweighting until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hourglass is sacrificed and the ivy planted, reweighting the miracle’s displacement into forward-looking stewardship; cost is the empty glass in hand. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—coffee-ring readings, plant whispers, and artifact repetitions accrue until the final cadence shifts. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (quiet tower, dawn, post-anesthesia). No causality break; every beat stems from the prior (rings → tunnel → chamber → planting). Meets 9+ quick test for closure under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she maps her own shelved love, re-prices her exile, and writes “stay” instead of goodbye—cost is the visible forfeiture of expert detachment. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight stakes rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught early via “iron ladder…projection booth” and the whispering static pattern; spatial fog later pays off, so no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the self-addressed boxes lands on schedule.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the city’s windows open “by a finger’s width,” reconfiguring both the town and the narrator’s future. The persistent price—lifelong nightly pilgrimages—lands on-page in the final sentence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor-sketched line thickens pattern until the blank pages tremble, then the aurora “gathers like a vow,” a final density spike that reweights meaning. Setup taught early; transitions are legible; orientation anchored by line 3—no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive folds itself into the car, the clock ticks once, and the train becomes a “greenhouse moving north”—a charged poise that reweights the premise from entropy to guarded renewal. Causality is lyric-accumulative: humming, bottle-breath, and spore-planting accrue until the archive chooses form; the pattern is taught by the third sentence and holds. Orientation is established by line 4 (“the rail glitters like a vein across the glowing dune”) and never drifts. The single visible cost—the clock’s one tear-like tick—feels proportionate to the fable scale, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the inserted second rewires perception and maps future translocations (Conceptual Repricing with cost). Causal chain—gear → gap → repair → new perception—holds without gaps. The “ache” shift at midpoint provides the required tightening. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, cadence shift at end is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the star-mapped palm and internalized skiff constitute a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, future rowing now inevitable, cost felt. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the ridge appears when the leash breaks, the ferry floats on choices, and each bend walked converts fear into path—tightening achieved through pattern, not reversal. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but anchored early by the bay’s stones and moon-stitched ridge; disorientation serves closure, so Orientation Test waived. One minor slack: the phrase “skiff nest inside my chest” is the first intimation of interior ferry; the metaphor arrives late yet still reweights stakes on the final line, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolted bench reweights the rule that “music must be confiscated,” proving safety’s price can be renegotiated through stubborn listening. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned frost, radiator clicks, and breath-etched clefs accumulate until the final warmer exhale reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“checked in without a suitcase”) and never wavers; the single transition down the spiral is legible. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: “the silence remained, it no longer asked us to forgive it”—a charged stasis that forecloses the old contract.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: each pellet-planted book causes Serane’s next revelation; the rune-of-drift column causes past/present to handshake at the exact beat she touches the ink. Closure is Earned Stasis—Serana’s renunciation is irreversible, ink stain on skin the visible cost. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“ancient temple library…stone”). No teleporting props; the pellet’s trail is causally legible from first drop to final glossary sealing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s breathing geometry is named, shared, and will keep migrating; the cost is the keeper’s nightly labor of re-inscription. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: tapping patterns → decoded atlas → corridor revealed → village procession. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sea level monitoring station sat on pylons”) and never slips. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the torn page’s payoff is set up by its first appearance and fulfilled when beats are rewritten onto it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the star-map projection reweights the colony’s “lull” from despair to navigable possibility, and the cost—Mara’s exposure of the Lark’s survival—lands on the page. Causal linkage holds throughout: because she listens, therefore she finds the ring; because she bridges it, therefore the bay answers; because the map burns gold, therefore the rebellion can reorient. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten at the shuttle carcass; no disorientation survives to closure. One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene—scope defaults met; the hum-as-drive pattern is taught early and repaid in the final banner of light.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seedling becomes a living scaffold that re-weights “destiny” from relic to co-authored tool. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens; each plant whisper and kite line layers density rather than tight because/therefore links. The mirror-of-fire-water moment is the visible cost—Lida risks scalding and exile—though the text drifts into choral affirmation rather than a single crystallized price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rafi folds the photograph with hands “steady as a trellis in wind,” reweighting trauma into still-bearing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each salt-stained pane, vent-fan whir, and graft seam adds density until the final image crystallizes options without promising safety. Cost is legible in the scar-decision to keep working by “that feeling,” a pearl whose weight is felt even though unpaid. One micro-transition (niece’s arrival) is well-anchored; orientation is secure by line 20.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the relit lens reweights her earlier “fragmented reality” into custodianship of faces and beam. Causal chain—card threading → wick braid → light restored—lands with felt cost (salt-raw hands, public exposure). Keeper’s log line becomes the constraint she inherits; lighthouse and self simultaneously relit.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist’s disappearance refuses the metronome’s bargain and the market collapses; the hummingbird’s new song is the visible cost/reconfiguration. Causal chain holds: ink tasting → pattern reveals stall zones → maps expose footfalls → metronome confronted → refusal erases self. Orientation anchor (who/where) is present by line 3; wind-carved camp and eclipse timestamp are immediate. One causality wobble: the algorithm is revealed only in the penultimate paragraph, so the early “buyers” remain abstract a beat too long.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the city wakes “strangely rested,” the bench “forgot to be a bench,” and the library holds its breath with the narrator—an undeniable reconfiguration of meaning with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (frost, duct, camera glitch) layers until the quiet itself is re-priced. Causality is lyric but traceable: because he releases the letter, therefore the glances bend and the plaza footage refuses to be clipped. The persistent constraint—his erased future as archivist—shapes every tactical hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the protagonist’s decision to press the father’s letter to the sandbag scrap and tie both to the oldest rose reconfigures grief into continuity with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visitor’s softened knife, each rooted seedling, tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes the stake—“turning ruin toward renewal.” The orientation anchor (dome, roses, heat) is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “This is my work, and it is enough to keep the world threaded.”

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens declared on page 1 (“braided music…hills of whisper”) and held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—by surrendering the coastline-map he has absorbed, the fisher pays an inner cost that reweights the garden’s silence. Orientation (“I stood at its jetty”) arrives by word 18, well under the 120-word waiver. Causality remains associative rather than because/therefore, appropriate to the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: because journalist cracks → therefore ascent; because lens shuts → therefore markets stall. Proof-by-contraction wager is the decisive change with conceptual cost—she rewrites the orbit of news itself. Closure image—nib as compass, daylight pouring—reweights premise without moralizing. One micro-turn (caretaker’s astonishment) tightens stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers sound-objects (letters, recorder, amber, cabinet) until the final tattoo reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early through the “laboratory of lost sounds” and never drifts. Closure is a Charged Poise: the insect “choosing” plus the speaker’s crackled “thank you” reconfigures the guilt-map inward. Cost is legible on the pulse-line—he must stay and listen forever.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of sand, chalk, mist, and flake accrete until the final “emergent hush” reweights listening itself as the earned prize. Orientation is swift: grotto, artist, three-day rite within first 90 words. Causality is loose but coherent—each grain moved or chalk arc drawn slightly re-tunes the social weather until the hush arrives as a collective stance. Cost is conceptual: the group leaves “carrying nothing,” yet the hush now lives in their breathing—a Charged Poise that forecloses certainty without verbal decree.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tessera returned, the past loosens, cost visible in the steel arms that must keep working. Causality holds: because the boy brings caps, the mosaic speaks “Sila,” which in turn enables the renaming of the arsonists—each step because/therefore under the Causal lens. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) and never breaks; the single transition from boy to accused men is cleanly handled within the continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each lyrical shard layers sensory density until the final image reweights the stake—nostalgia becomes a gentle release. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold; transitions across maze ↔ theater are legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the coin cools, the bell fades, the orchard bows—felt cost is the ongoing shared custodianship that neither can quit. The piece meets the 9+ quick test under the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the un-lit muscovite on the sill reweights the whole evening, making the “lantern” they built an after-image the reader now carries. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each wand pass and exhale tightens the same stake—can memory be gentled?—until the final stillness forecloses further attempts. The 120-word anchor is met: “light painting studio,” two characters, rainy night. Cost is legible in the dulled shard and their joined stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each beat adds strata of memory—leaf, limestone, storm—until the amber plateau reweights “voice” as reciprocal listening. Closure lands: the fossil left behind = Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—he can no longer claim pure outsider status. Minor slip: orientation anchors (who/where) arrive after 120 w but the poetic delay pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy softens into communal clay—undeniable social cost and reconfiguration of power. Causal chain holds: theft → catalog method → ledger bridge → open warehouse → shared authority. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“amber warehouse beneath cliffs”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the density of button-echo pairings tightens the stake until the final image reweights it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because pillbox contains both exit-past and future-ring, therefore Ansel can trade film for return; hinge-click is the decisive beat that forecloses cleaner-death option. Microfilm disposal + ring acceptance creates on-page cost under moonlight; salt tide accepting secrets images conceptual repricing of exile as livable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by 5th sentence; no teleporting props. Single reversal—trading cyanide legacy for steady-burn mentorship—earned by prior fire trauma and Len’s silent vouch.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density, stitch-pierce sounds, and gutter-ticking rain layer until the sail-map fusion reweights the promise. Closure is Charged Poise: the yarn-sail flutters with undrowned possibility, cost felt in the coachman’s softened shoulders and the fog’s parting alleys. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by lantern, ferry rope, and river slap within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands cleanly: the braided timelines tighten into a Charged Poise (“the place resisted change by practicing it gently”) with conceptual cost—the potter renounces possession of the oasis and bears the shawl of its times. Accumulative lens holds: each micro-gift (water, cleaned frames, sung note) layers density until the thrum reconfigures meaning, no causal breaks, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain is pristine: dropped petal → promise → skiff → lock → lantern → beam → child pointed at. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options until the last click locks the protagonist into caretaking. Closure is Earned Stasis: the decision to stay and rotate the light carries the visible cost of perpetual vigil. Orientation lands by line 3 (“fire escape gardener”), spatial anchors hold across the rowing sequence, and the inferred lens (Causal) is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal exposure/re-shelving intensifies until the atlas sings coordinates. Closure is an Earned Stasis—the protagonist re-anchors the floating nave by voicing the herd-song at cost of vocal strain and acknowledged perpetual drift (“I do not wait for visitors”). Orientation is taught in first line (“tidal library above clouds”) and paid off when the same tilt is steadied; no penalty. Causality holds: sundial → light-blade → atlas → song → hum re-rounds; no off-stage shortcuts. Cost is legible in the final image: “a table made from waiting” that forecloses any promise of arrival. A hairline slip: the stone-circle mechanics remain lightly abstract, barely keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choral reading of withheld letters reconfigures the lovers’ stance and the crowd’s complicity under the accumulative lens; cost is felt when strangers speak their private lines aloud. Causality holds—threads, leaves, and bowl all planted early—though orientation is soft until “the city always comes here” (~130 w) which waives penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mosaic structure (studio → theater roof → quad) is taught early by signal-jumping ellipses and lands a clean Charged Poise: the quiet band labeled for “storms and funerals” reweights all prior noise. Causal linkage holds—each broadcast tweak narrows options until the protagonist refuses tenure, paying visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 100 words; no disorientation. Closure beat carries unmistakable conceptual cost: the stray signal recedes, but the community must now stay “messy, slower, and unowned.” Persistent constraint (the spare clean channel) shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the alleys mutiny, therefore the protagonist negotiates via sound-geometry; each linkage tightens options. Closure is a Charged Poise—the telescope re-aimed downward reweights the city’s “hunger to be heard” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt. One soft spot: spatial rules of the mutiny never fully codified, so the final cease-fire feels slightly lucky rather than ruled.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blue ribbon reweights the case narrative—Mara may have traded masks to defuse cruelty—creating undeniable social cost (someone else wore her kindness). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of objects (ribbon, phone case, perfume) escalates stakes by re-patterning the myth of the fox mask. Orientation locked by line 3 (“the shadowed quarry…”) and held. Cost visible in final image: the bridge-tried-too-late painting forecloses the deputy’s evidentiary chain and the families’ need for a culprit.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: copper nail → reversed exile → exiles return with conceptual cost to the system. Causal chain is tight under lyric-accumulative lens; mists’ braid reversal is legible and charged. Orientation nailed by word 50. Minor slack: director’s “safety” rant restates stakes already shown, but this does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return (maps fluttering, scaffold arrows aligning, river-light pixelating) reweights stakes until the glass clarifies and the ledger signs. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—warm arm pressure and shared tune—whose conceptual cost (the mountain’s debt cancellation) is undeniable. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the fiddler must keep bow on bridge for the amnesty to stay legible, shaping every tactical move under the span.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the startup rise-and-fall pattern intensifies density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the circling tire-rut re-casts every map as a trap—felt cost is legible in the abandoned ribbons and the protagonist’s lone lingering. Orientation anchor (who/where) is present by line 3; no penalty. One soft spot: the investor retreat is summarized rather than dramatized, a minor ellipsis that does not break but lightly thins the causality chain.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shared reading of star-grammar turns glyphs into live grammar, reconfiguring both characters’ burdens under a Charged Poise—the observatory stores the mirror-story “inside our breathing.” Causal chain holds: unopened telegram → Mara arrival → joint decoding → verbal sharing → earned charge. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: star flux density braids with dialogue to reweight meaning. Orientation and transitions are legible; no seams break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the mayor breathes the spoken truth, the seed spent, circles calm—an on-page restraint that forecloses spectacle and carries felt cost (the druid’s heart “unbends one unmilitant notch”). Causal lens holds throughout: each expanding circle narrows options until the seed’s bite removes the lie and leaves bare truth. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) surface within first 120 words via “we arrive,” raft, pier, night. No teleporting props; the coin receipt is introduced and paid off in final image, satisfying set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the braided vow replaces the sun-bound circle, recorded in cambium with palpable cost—“sometimes” time is the forfeiture. Causality holds under lyric-accumulative lens; each scar-exchange and hedge-word tightens options toward that final concession. Orientation is taught early via surreal anchor (“cobalt glade… residual lightning from tomorrow”), waiving penalty. One missed opportunity: the gardeners’ capitulation could carry sharper physical consequence to dramatize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the act of scattering grandmother’s stories-seeds reweights the market’s rule-set and visibly forecloses the narrator’s old grief-loop. Causal lattice holds—card → map → pit → trade → planting—each step a because/therefore linkage under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final line: she will “return with more names to trade,” i.e. perpetual exposure to the market’s suction, a price she accepts on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scrap is re-classified from trash to relic with social/occupational cost visible in the ledger line. Causal lens holds—because the narrator failed publicly, therefore he seeks refuge in facts, but the cloth forces a repricing that reopens loss. The quarry as echo-chamber is set up early and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s soft chime re-weights the premise—transition is not a puzzle to solve but a pressure to accompany. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tablet-pressed node, each voiced vowel, layers density until the field hums anew. The cost is palpable—“the vacuum that remains”—and the final image of the seed’s pale helix drinking the tuned field makes the price undeniable. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the hollow sky is taught early and pays off as the chime finds the ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the librarian shoulders the indefinite, tide-driven duty of remembering, a conceptual cost legible in the final “keep” exchange; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence reweight wonder versus routine; orientation is taught early via sensory anchors, no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pearl’s placement reconfigures the cave, the bunker, and the inspector’s vocation in one quiet click; the cost is the inspector’s forfeiture of regulatory certainty, felt in the vow signed with silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—images braid, density increases, and the final image reweights every etched confession. Causality remains intact: the shell, the pearl, and the directive spiral all precede the crown act. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shallow re-weights the narrator’s entire epistemic frame, costing him the right to use the river as self-mirror. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffiti coordinate adds density until the final arrow reconfigures meaning. The persistent constraint—the river’s indifferent honesty—shapes every tactical move from tile-reading to stepping into the current. Cost is legible in the image of the stick-marked margin and the relinquished number twelve.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain: letter → map → watch → cipher → slit → corridor → desk → echo. Each step is driven by the protagonist’s interpretive labor, not luck. The cyclically-reversed watch elegantly teaches its own rule early (“kept perfect time when you looked away”) and pays it off in the final tick that “clicked satisfied.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the second letter will arrive “by echo” only when the narrator makes room to hear—an open future re-weighted by the visible cost of patience already paid. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet coherent; the library’s geography abstracts into gesture, but that serves the accumulative/textural lens confessed in “propagation delays.”

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he can hear plants, therefore he heeds their warning; because he swore to let the violin choose, therefore he plays it to death. One tight scene, one escalating pressure line (museum noon arrival) keeps orientation crisp; the dissolve of the instrument is a decisive change with visible cost (melt-water on tongue). No teleporting stakes; closure lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the balm absorbs the mentor’s last sentence, the chip dims, the narrator is left holding a “seed” that forecloses resurrection yet keeps a shimmer between emptinesses. Causality is interior but causal: because she re-tunes the chip, she harvests the echo that then re-tunes her. Aurora-grotto rules are taught early and obeyed; no teleport of props. Cost is legible in the final image—the sealed, exhausted chip and her remade stance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each image layer (hairpin, map shards, vine mist) tightens the thematic cord until the final reconfiguration—“belonging without ownership”—lands with felt conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 5; transitions are seamless. Closure beat (“the wall had closed…”) is on-page CR that reweights all prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lark steps to the rail, town waking beneath, gulls as “impartial jurors”—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure and cost is felt. Causal chain holds: dune argument → chime divination → public confession, each because/therefore link narrowing her future. The hollow shard’s emptiness as “where to stop performing” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Minor waiver: orientation (who-hires-whom) is delayed past 120 words, but the delay serves the final image, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ripple-image thickens the pattern until the last line reweights “vanishing” as gift. The grotto’s hum, the candles, the rising stone all return with altered charge, delivering a Charged Poise that lets the final “space needed” land as undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon folds, the pulse is heard, the protagonist travels without moving—cost is the emptied cord and the ancestral solitude now shared. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every echo thickens the pattern until the final image reweights stillness as motion. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: removing the “joke” keystone dims the light yet leaves a hush that seeds new creative pauses in the city. Causal chain holds—keystone question → platform flex → luminous concession → renunciation—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (stairs, spire, clouds). Cost is legible in the final line: the sky closes around its question mark, surrendering ownership forever.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the silver hum becomes a color the narrator can carry, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—sound is now a weather he must tend. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, fitting an Accumulative/Textural lens: each glowing sentence knots him to seafloor quiet until the metronome heartbeat signals the earned stasis. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. The only drag is the mild soft-reset feel—he surfaces unchanged outwardly—but the internal reconfiguration is legible and charged, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the last line reweights the entire premise—static bursts become prayer—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each coin flip is a because/therefore trigger that reverses the gyros and distills silence. The backwards prophecy pattern is taught by line 6 and paid off in the final instruction; no orientation debt. Propulsive, legible, and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by naming “Shoreless” the reaper rewrites the rule that sacrifices must stay nameless, and the felt cost—his continuing loneliness—glints in the “thin, kind star” on the scythe. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wax-cylinder fragments, glass creatures, and atlas monsters accretes until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 9; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. One minor loop—“the dome breathed like a sleeping lung left to watch the weather” then “the dome would go on holding distant intimacy”—is a deliberate echo, not oversight, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken bell becomes a bridge that quietly re-balances sea and sky; the coordination hum carries undeniable conceptual cost—no triumph, only borrowed equilibrium. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each measured drip, syllable, and gull-note tightens the pattern until a modest cadence shift reweights the world. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 40 (sapphire viaduct at dawn, Efan, bell mission). No lens ambiguity; the poetical elisions teach the pattern early and pay it off in the final bell placement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: each photograph adds density until the grove assembly reweights the stake from neutral hazard removal to moral guardianship. Closure is a Charged Poise—headlights climbing the ridge, story orally transferred—whose cost is the warden’s future bureaucratic loneliness. Early orientation is swift: midnight ridgeway, drought-exposed bones, silent chime within 50 words. The mentor’s traced condensation cue anchors the reflective block without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the orchard root-breath freezes time, reconfigures meaning, and leaves Iri in crystallized balance. Causal chain holds—each starling pattern tightens options until she abandons the formula recital. Accumulative lens is taught early (color → orchard → starlings) and paid off when copper light fuses hair, tone, and decision. Cost is legible in the reliquary’s final white breath and the hollow starling question: she forfeits certainty for symbiosis.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the ship down, the friendship still scarred, the burden carried better—cost felt in the tightened chest and the unspoken apology. Causal linkage holds: revised route → lantern code → pilot’s tilt → safe kiss of cradle. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“platforms stitched to the trunks”). One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene; lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the joint-custody verdict reweights the premise, felt through the jar’s hum and the narrator’s draining frost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of complementary opposites taught early, tightened by the final water/fire swap—though the narrator’s causal role in the verdict is slightly off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: timer chimes, she bows, the brook keeps the shadow—cost is the quieter profit foregone. Causal chain is intact: seed arrives → Mara plants it → rules drafted → parallel ledger conceived → bow = vow. No orientation debt; anchors (annex, brook, night) land by line 40. Lens (Accumulative) holds: each image layers silence-as-value until the final cadence. Only hairline slip: “certificate…forge only in metaphor” momentarily winks at the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as an Accumulative Repricing: the tunnel returns a child’s squeal, the house “sighs awake,” and grief tips his hat—an image that reweights the silence. Yet the lens is taught late; the first 120 words swirl in lyric disorientation without cueing the accumulative design, so the orientation tax (−0.4) applies. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but the final image does carry felt cost—the conductor leaves without applause, having traded his own noise for their hush—so the unit is valid if thin.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator accepts perpetual borderlessness and the bead keeps a sliver of breath as tithe—cost is visible and irreversible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each repetition of “interiorize” tightens the weave until the world outside fits inside. No causal contradictions; the frozen sundial and refused dawn are consistent physics.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each approximation (salt, air, bellows) tightens options until the crozier’s snap becomes the decisive hinge. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—palm blistering, crozier reduced to ash, gate opening. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3; “ember nexus at twilight” instantly grounds. No off-stage resolution; every escalation sourced to protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of echoing signals, moon-bent towers, and hush-shard callbacks that tighten into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hatch-stair inward and the city’s laugh reweight the premise—“begin last, end first”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike yet taught early enough; no causality breaks, though the winch-tilt moment is compressed to a single sentence. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of both shard and star fragment, but the absence of a visible micro-choice in the final beat keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry “steadies” under the narrator’s feet, timetables bloom in frost, and arrivals now “move through me,” a reconfiguration legible only because the grotto’s lattice was causally built from wake-trails and star-mirrors. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (dew, dust, frost, tickets) tightens until the final image reweights permanence itself. Orientation is taught by the first clause—“clocks run sideways”—and waives any disorientation penalty. Cost is unmistakable in the line “I remained… sweeping dew where each footprint finally agreed to stay,” where the permanence he grants others is the transience he keeps.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each chamber layers perceptual distortions that re-weight trust and silence. Closure lands as Charged Poise—thread removed, rooms “keep their changes,” habitual belief forms; cost is the city’s future forgetting, felt in the curator’s acceptance of impermanence. No orientation debt; pattern taught by second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (kelp shadows, thermal edges, lamp-glare that “makes the water forget”) thickens until the alien reply reweights the whole texture. Closure is a Charged Poise: the folded-horizon blossom reframes prior mappings, cost felt in the narrator’s hush—“the unknown begins to feel like a coordinate.” Orientation anchors arrive by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: every new bulb erases subtler star-imprints, tightening tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tracer’s guidance fuses three ruptured lives into one phone call, re-weighting his role from recorder to midwife of reunion; the cost is the ungovernable fog he must now keep breathing. Causal linkage holds throughout—each beat (aid pulse → gallery → man’s room) tightens options under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“at my desk…twilight”). No teleporting props; the hearing-aid’s battery life is an implicit ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: leaving the gold reweights the entire moral ledger and is charged by the tidal clock. Causal chain (fleck → lock → list → renunciation) is tight; the Orientation Test is waived because disorientation serves the breath-held descent. Cost is legible in the final image of “evening metal” and the rebuilt ice seal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    A textbook Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical return of “after the radio static clears” tightens the same stake—can the narrator bear to face the error—until the final fade-out reconfigures meaning without expository hand-holding. The closure image (shard-as-lens pocketed under opal snow) is a Charged Poise that reprices earlier blindness as portable vigilance; cost is felt in the relinquishing of absolution. Orientation is taught by sensory immediacy within 50 words; no caps triggered. Causality is intact: the ghost’s coordinates arise from the narrator’s own archived voice, so the mistake is self-authored and self-repaired.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each new echo-layer thickens the linguistic sediment until the final braid of notes becomes the resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate—“At dusk I arrived…” anchors who/where/when in first sentence. Closure is on-page: the protagonist’s surrendered name leaves a “ringing cavity,” a felt cost that reweights the canyon’s new school of texture-song. Pattern is taught early (notch where sound turns) and paid off when the tunnel folds around the diamond—no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden inhales, re-weighting the premise with undeniable pressure. Causality is dream-logic ("the floor inhaled, and something below exhaled me") but holds within an Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern of breath, swing, and root growth teaches the rule early. Orientation is sketchy—no city name or garden layout until midpoint—but the lyric disorientation pays off in the final stair of vertebrae, so waiver applies. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the keeper must be kept.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: orchard breathes, statues sway, city machines stutter—beauty reclaimed without escape. Causal chain holds: soft tone → sap response → copper leaves fall → stone joints unclench. One transition (bridge to orchard floor) is legible; orientation anchored in first 50 words. Cost is felt in the hush that follows silence; no explicit price is paid by body, so barely misses 9.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s posture change reweights the whole route under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact—every beat (jar opening, mirror portrait, letter reroute) accumulates pressure until the final image. Cost is felt in the “lighter” exit and the ungoverned heart. No teleporting props; the sunflower letter is seeded early, paid off last.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, bells, oasis, fragment) intensifies the stake—voice vs. silence—until the carpenter’s sung note becomes the pattern-break that reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise: the carousel turns by consent, lamps breathe, travelers listen; the cost is his irrevocable step from shadow into resonance, a social/self price legible in the synchronized bells. No orientation debt; “who/where” is anchored by the second sentence. Causality is lyrical but never loose—every metaphoric thread pays into the final lattice of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical accretion of library imagery leading to a CR—that stories’ weather, not location, matters. Cause/therefore links are loose but patterned; shelving by curvature is taught early and paid off in the “salt becomes snow” reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: the map folds shut, knowledge remains unfinished. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear within 60 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative / lyric lens holds: each photograph-layer thickens the hush-map rather than causes next event. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—dream escapes while its reflected route is fixed in emulsion; librarian’s refusal to possess creates Charged Poise with felt cost (“some absences must remain luminous”). The map hums, re-weighting the entire archive. Orientation is deliberately mist-soft, but pattern taught early (“I was the odd-hour librarian…”) waives penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the song reweights the premise—loss becomes invitation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The broken-mirror courtyard crystallizes meaning and cost in one image; the sky’s hum answers with undeniable social/emotional price. Causality is intact: each symbolic action (hair placed, ribbon released) tightens the pattern toward the audible release. No orientation or lens ambiguity; transitions are legible, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s double entry of grandmother’s name and the warmth in the glove reweight memory’s economy under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: confession → ring brightens → partial restitution, with a persistent constraint—only partial return, late fees implied. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the council’s reluctant stay stamps a conceptual cost that reweights the library’s hinge function. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard, cup, and shadow accretes into the final corridor that forces the council to see its own exit/return. Pattern is taught early (“reversible exile”) and paid off when the corridor folds back into glass, but the Orientation Test is waived because deliberate disorientation (drifting swing, unnamed city) is later re-anchored by the council’s literal measuring tapes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed planted in the parapet crack crystallizes a new covenant—wonder will now root itself nightly, no longer hoarded in a locket. Cost is unmistakable: Miren relinquishes sole custodianship of ancestral memory, accepting perpetual vigilance by a child she cannot command. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pruning cut adds testimony-scent to the seed until the final cadence shift reweights the valley’s taste. Orientation is swift—parapet, waterfall, dawn—and the pattern of testimony-feeding is taught by 25 %, satisfying Track B mosaic rules.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the masks ringed round the salt-locket hearth, tide paused as if its pupils “turned toward us.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each unraveled knot off-loads breath-history until the sanctuary’s hush changes weight; the final hush is heavier because it is chosen, not hoarded. Orientation is taught in the first 40 words via the cathedral-of-rainbows image; time and place remain anchored through recurrent starlight glints on glass. Cost is unmistakable: “the needle drank the room, and the room did not protest” simultaneously drains the sanctuary and fills the masks with footing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of silence, damp, and breath layers until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the hills…”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the torn map hung “marking the saved hush” crystallizes options—travelers must decide where known ends. Cost is felt in the exposed tear and the parish’s tentative day-opening. Persistent constraint: the slit architecture that folds words into stone shapes all tactics. One causality quibble: the 1999 lime-bubble exactly under the map tear reads slightly lucky, but it is presented as discovered pattern, not coincidence that resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow globe’s second weather reweights the entire dive from retrieval to release. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of salt-ruin, paper sighs, static-knotted voices—culminating in the charged image of the globe ascending toward “light.” Cost is legible in the final line: “time for air and sorrow,” a finite currency split between survival and grief. No causality breaks; every object threads back to the keeper’s hands and the narrator’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: bolts → chalk → valve blinks form a taught pattern that tightens into a Resonant Reconfiguration (city breathes). Orientation is taught by line 6 (“misty courtyard above clouds”), so no penalty. Cost is conceptual—singer becomes hinge, song becomes utility—but the final image crystallizes that reconfiguration with legible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each floor adds a density layer that reweights the stake from retrieval to compassionate curation; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—diary left open reconfigures meaning of “servant” and “vault.” Orientation anchored by line 3; causality intact. Cost legible in final image; persistent constraint (elevator as throat) shapes tactics throughout. Minor late abstraction keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s laugh crystallizes acceptance and the gondola clicks back into fleet, re-weighting the earlier drift with earned communion. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud-named emotion deepens the archive of absence until the silence becomes generative, not vacant. The Orientation anchor (who/where) is cleanly in place by line 4. The only drag is the slight over-reliance on retrospective summary ("I write…") rather than dramatized log strokes, a hairline slip that keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s dawn glows inside the fallen trunk, reweighting the premise that sky needs windows. Causality holds: coin → atlas → pigment → mural → survival, each step because/therefore. Orientation is taught early (“the hush arrives… condemned building waits”) and pays off when the blast folds the tent. Cost is legible in the last line—“quiet as a pulse, bright as a promise”—the lived pulse now belongs to the tree, not the artist.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the figure-eight trace frees the light and re-casts the apprentice’s insomnia as successful method; cost is conceptual—language snared mid-utterance, ropes unprickled, town’s dawn restored—felt on page (“tongues our own again”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starling vectors + chalk grid + hopscotch numerals tighten into one pattern break that releases luminance. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality gaps. Pattern taught early (dog-ear grid) and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the palm-sized wheel spins as “steady heart,” daylight spills, and the library creaks—cost is the perpetual loan of his attention. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each gear tweak accrues until mirrors thaw, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and paid off when younger selves appear. One causality hairline: the prophecy bottle’s power is externally granted, but cedar memory motivates, softening the break.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula appears only after collective exhaustion is accepted, reweighting prior squabbles as petty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each bell-ring, chalk line, and gift jars density until the final misted bell-spray crystallizes the new orbit of trust. Causality holds: Lio’s wind-fingers loosen fruit, chalk directs labor, bell governs rhythm; no late rule changes. Orientation is clear by line 3 (orchard planet, floating arches, harvest). Cost is legible in the “rain inside our ribs” image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper’s sung lullaby crystallizes a vow whose cost is the perpetual burden of delay. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned nested gears, hush-pane, and lullaby motifs tighten into a final cadence that reweights the world’s noise. One causality micro-slippage: the bent brass tooth is filed, but the story never shows how this literal fix alters the beam’s reach; the song’s power is asserted rather than mechanically traced. Still, the ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost—time itself is borrowed at the price of one human throat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: salt, sap, and clockwork ticks thicken into a single breathless density until the corridor-lock clicks open and the trio spill onto the cliff—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard’s grip is momentarily loosened and the caretaker’s perpetual loop is made visible. The forgotten blueprint is not explained but physically carried in muscle memory, satisfying cost without exposition. One causal micro-turn—the nut clicking the wall—serves as the decisive hinge; no other reversal is needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reversible-ring copolymer sketch reweights the premise with undeniable social cost (lawsuits, scorn) and is signaled by the chrysalis-in-notebook image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—foam patterns teach cadence, density increases until the insight reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“braided ravine”), well inside 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (foam = score of entrances) and paid off in final sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the comma-seed reweights the premise that beginnings must be earned by attention, not ink. Causality is lyric-Accumulative; the hinge-air is taught early via “quantifying absence” and paid off when moonlight outlines the hinge. Orientation is clear by line 8; the withheld “where” becomes the thematic quest, not confusion. Cost is conceptual—stories now carry the weight of silence—but not felt as personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bowls emptied, the keeper stands taller, the dream exhales—cost paid on-page in the metallic-to-soft broth shift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each puddle, filament, and spoon adds density that re-weights remorse rather than causing external turns. Orientation is anchored by line 7 (chef, courtyard, post-rain), well within 120-word margin. No causality breaks; the coral’s consent is metaphorical yet internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s social architecture is permanently rewired by the bridges, the elevator’s voice shifts from grain-monologue to dinner-invitation, and the cuckoo weight becomes communal baton—cost is the irreversible exposure of the silos to human traffic and song. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each bridge plank is a because/therefore under Mara’s conducted beat, tightening until the final canon fuses languages into one breathable structure. Orientation is swift: astronomical clock tower, star charts, orphaned weight anchor who-where-when by line 4. No lens ambiguity; the ending image (elevator exhaling rye-scented peace) reweights every prior mechanical groan into shared sustenance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror pulse layers density until the final seam opens. Closure is a Charged Poise—“wider field of view” after the mirror splits—cost is the irreversible break of both artifact and observer. Orientation is taught early via the swinging “wounded compass,” waiving any anchor penalty. Causality is internal but legible: because he keeps refracting, the canyon answers.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s locks “pause before accepting imprecise grief” reweights the stake from personal recovery to civic patience, with the iron band’s warmth as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of inverted imagery and pollen-letters tighten until the final hush—though the grotto’s rule-set is taught late, slightly blurring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final “breath of hush” reweights every prior beat, conceding the grove will speak only when wind chooses—undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “empathy in motion” deepens density until the porcelain’s lower note settles “like loam.” No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by line 4. Causality stays intact—no convenient amnesia, no off-stage thunder to resolve tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is re-negotiated through the endgame, not by silencing but by teaching restraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—field hum and pauses tighten until the quiet chord—but the price is more atmospheric than bodily, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diary opens not by force but by tuned consent, reweighting the premise that silence can be touched without bruise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; each sonic layer thickens the hush until the brass clasp remembers its hinge. Orientation is swift—workshop, fireworks eve, first person—within 50 words. One hairline slip: “theatrical sincerity” is named rather than shown, but the moment is brief and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is immaculate: “ambition softened into stewardship” crystallizes a Charged Poise; a conceptual cost (permanent caretaking of a hated plant) rewires prior stakes. Causal chain is tight: parcel → seed → ritual → bridge steadied; each beat because/therefore tightens option space. Lens is Causal throughout; no amnesia or soft resets. Minor wobble: village collective as “opposition” is off-stage, so pressure occasionally reads as atmospheric, but the final image re-centers agency on narrator—cost legible, lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused heart/arrow planted beneath the repaired drum reweights the premise—resilience is propagative, not defensive. Cost is legible in the pilot’s vow to “listen each inversion,” a life-long servitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of water, echo, sap tightens until the spindle releases a “breath of water inside light.” No causal breaks; every inversion rule is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the patch barely stirring as the helicopter slips into the newly mapped corridor reweights every prior chalk line; cost is the perpetual vigilance the investigator must now carry. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is clean—each ribbon and wind note tightens density until the final image. No teleporting props or orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 5. The only nit is that the “twenty meters north / three seconds late” rule is declared rather than dramatized, a hairline slip that still leaves the effect legible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crystalline Charged Poise: the sculpted hush becomes common air, a conceptual repricing that forces the world to “recalibrate every ledger.” Cost is legible in the bell ringer’s quiet departure—no applause, no commission, only the tuning-fork walk away. Accumulative lens holds: each ring thickens color-density until the final auroral lake mirrors the new standard. No orientation debt; pattern taught by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the market exhales, driftwood lane points windward, the seam knits clean—an undeniable social cost for the valley. Causal lattice holds: miscount → breach → return → slower weave → restoration. Orientation anchors (Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, chalky dirt) appear before 120 words; deliberate lyric elision is taught early and repaid in the final charged image. One thinning spot: the jump from second to third note could use a micro-beat to show why tempo alone reseals; still, the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator signs with the “smallest name,” accepting editorial guilt for translating cosmic loss into human arithmetic; cost is the blank sky that “washes my hands cleaner than solvent.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of print-shop imagery and star-catalogues reweights the stake until the final absence reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; transitions from couple to solitude are cleanly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the yew sprig planted, corridor sealed, widow’s coin and courier’s song exchanged—felt cost on every beat. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of breath-tuning and green note intensifies until the ridge itself reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (aurora ridge, switchback, lantern) land before 120 words. Mentor absence is taught early and paid off in the “old green hush” final image. Causality stays intact; no prop or knowledge teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Mara walking "less afraid of explanation" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she must now carry the grief she tried to drop. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught by the arbor’s listening hush and paid off when the frost reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 ("before dawn at the quartz arbor"). No causal break; every refraction and frost pattern is motivated by earlier sensory seeding. The prism’s warmth in the closing beat is the accruing density that tightens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each weave pass thickens the emotional density until the fabric’s launch reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kio’s emptied loom and the brother’s felt wind—with visible cost (“she must thin herself”). Orientation is taught early by sensory anchors; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the dead-river “wound” is introduced late, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arches settle, ladders root, and the town’s stance shifts from collapse to deliberate upkeep. Causal chain holds—silk tightens on honest oaths, wind halts when price is paid—without forcing linear spectacle. Orientation is clear by line 8 (orchard planet, quake aftermath). Accumulation cap: one minor scaffold (“the stone hummed softly like a song learning words”) does not touch the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist re-weights her own childhood act as survivable cartography, not shame. The shard-refracted photolog supplies the decisive image; the final redirection of others’ paths shows the cost exported outward. Causal lattice holds: each universe-thread plants the same fuel-coupler command, tightening to the single moment the adult now owns. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and paid off in the last “bay unlocked across differences.”

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of letters-stones-glass tightens the keeper’s duty into communal guardianship; closure lands on “Thank you” left with five stones—an Earned Stasis that forecloses escape from the island role with felt loneliness as cost. Orientation is swift (lamp dies, room, storm), transitions inside mosaic shards are legible, causality is lyric rather than plot-driven. No meaningful pressure turn beyond the lamp failure, so escalation stays modest, but the final image reweights the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse vows to “keep its emerald vow to tomorrow,” a conceptual repricing that reframes the entire vigil as futile yet necessary; cost is the eternal loop of accidental prophecy. Accumulative/textural lens holds: repetition of “laugh,” “steer,” “total internal reflection” tightens the pattern until the final beam reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early—“under stars after the last print newspaper folded”—so disorientation serves lyric design. One shard only; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s stance crystallizes into “a lighthouse of cups and cloth” that seeds stories outward, forfeiting ownership. Causal chain holds: because the wing teaches iridescent caution, therefore he adjusts posture, re-weighting whose tales stick. Accumulated light-patterning (sun-river, indigo steam) tightens once, foreclosing hoarding. Cost is visible on the page: he accepts perpetual semi-invisibility—“nearly seen”—as the price of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sealed sextant + archived “minutes” reweight grief from abyss to archive, cost felt in the final image of “minutes yet unread.” Causal chain is lyric-elliptical yet coherent under Accumulative lens; moonlight healing is seeded early, paid off at climax. One shard only (continuous night), so scope default is met; orientation anchor arrives by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom-window slides its woven dawn into the orchard, night negotiates new boundaries, and the protagonist accepts perpetual co-existence with her scarred twin. Causality is lyric-accumulative (threads = voices), yet every escalation is linked to her micro-choices (asking pomegranates, harvesting sighs). Cost is palpable: she forfeits sole ownership of memory and dawn. One sentence could be clearer on ledger omission, but the image of shared scars lands undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s anonymity is re-priced—no longer refuge but mercy earned through shared reading of Mistake/Wisdom. Causal chain holds: invitation → notebook past → library confrontation → handshake that forecloses old self. One transition (shelf corridor) is legible; orientation anchored by line 11. Cost is palpable in the final sentence: “the city can hold you without knowing you.”</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stationery shop dust, toppled shelf corridor, municipal fluorescents that warm into discerning lamps—each detail constrains visibility and social temperature. The paired-book stacks (“grief against gratitude”) act as micro-setting that forces the dyadic reading. Notebook full of unsent letters recurs as handled object whose prior sale cues present shame. Spatial choreography remains coherent through six turns and the handshake at the exit desk.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts an ongoing, tenuous accountability—absolution is not granted but practiced daily through returned attention and crumbs in the seams. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tender, reversible acts accrues until the shared tea and bread reconfigure the meaning of witness. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of perpetual “holding” the line. Orientation is swift; ivy, courtyard, and season anchor by line 4 and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the narrator seals himself into the ledger, paying with perpetual exile and archival servitude; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of spectral measurements tightening into birds that sew light) holds, reweighting the stake from saving the archive to becoming it. Orientation is taught by ~120 words (“In the frozen library above clouds… my post hung between eternity and weather”). Persistent constraint—being the last entry—shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The truce-of-hush rule is taught by line 3, anchors causality under a situational lens, and pays off when the broken trust is silently recorded rather than spoken. Orientation is locked within the first 100 words; the mosaic of near-transactions builds pressure by narrowing options until Kettle’s reach and the smuggler’s recoil crystallize the fracture. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the recorder holds the inaudible inhale, the hush still binds feet until sunrise, and Lark’s departure reweights the fob and the pier’s breath. Cost is visible—the smuggler’s sleeve-snatch and the split lime—but the protagonist’s personal consequence remains oblique, keeping the score just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of taste-anchors teaches the compass logic early; closure reweights “north” to “us” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation locked by line 4; single deepening at the fork tightens companionship as stakes. One transition (bluff → meadow) is legible; final image crystallizes options under auroral hush. Cost is on-page: “taste of alone returns” = forfeiture of solitary certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s dawn-pigment release reweights the premise—memory must be spent, not stored—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each face-sketch accumulates until the cave crystals refract them, and the drawn lock reconstitutes the broken steel, a single meaningful tightening with felt cost. No orientation debt; pattern is taught early. One hairline slip: the laugh-echo frame is repeated three times, a micro-loop that nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of withheld/canned candor builds density until the jars’ release reweights survival. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “we measured survival together in truths” revalues the city’s rule-set with undeniable social cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Postal fragment → shredded map → jar archive linkage is taught early and paid off in final hatch image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Iri refuses to surrender the shard, stamps the ledger star, and the Keepers leave unburdened, visible cost in her tremor and their slowed gait. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iceberg refraction, bell resonance, and cloud pause crystallize meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by line 5; disorientation is lyrical, not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mineral/roses/tin imagery intensifies until the fingertip burn reweights stakes. Closure—archived tin voice annotation—makes conceptual cost undeniable: system logs now contain tenderness, an irreversible contamination. Orientation anchored by word 40 (‘greenhouse dusk’); later disorientation (magnetic drift) is taught early and pays off in final compass re-map. No causality breaks; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint: the child’s tin heartbeat now shapes future recalibrations.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unlocked mailbox redefines the entire courtyard from thrift-shop archive to open library, with the felt cost of relinquished exclusivity. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each testimony adds density until the hairpin’s tapping pattern triggers the lock’s surrender. The midpoint orientation is clear by line 6; no caps triggered. One micro-turn—developers’ intrusion—serves as pattern break that intensifies rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught immediately: tide-returns, spider-web time, dice-cipher rhythm. Each new image adds density until the final “strands hummed with traffic” reweights the stake—names cross back to life. Orientation is deliberate disorientation (seabed ceilings, cursive fish) that pays off at closure when disorientation becomes the escape route. Cost is felt in the exact line “a knot deciding it had been a bow all along,” a Conceptual Repricing that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tin re-inhales hillside scent and the last lantern fixes a path through mutable gravity, reweighting the premise that memory can be externalized without private erasure. Cost is legible in the final image—“a forgiven word”—and in the persistent constraint that the sister’s laugh will stay inside glass, not skull. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: salt crystals, coffee-ground constellations, and gravity pockets accrete until the final cadence crystallizes options. Pattern is taught by word 150, orientation anchors land by word 90, no late rule changes; the whale remains causally inert backdrop, satisfying coincidence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy’s code literally unties like wet shoelaces, leaving “room” rather than void—an undeniable reweighting of the future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, fold, and hush-layer thickens the stake until the final image (“the valley listened”) pays off the pattern with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal pressed into rooftop stone lets the building speak its weather-kept rain, re-weighting every prior “agreed lie.” The accumulative/textural lens holds—density of architectural metaphors tightens until mortar literally speaks. Causality stays intact: every tea session accrues listening skill needed to decode the wax imprint. One soft spot: orientation is slightly late (~140 words) yet pays off at closure, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child disperses, the narrator absorbs winter with conceptual cost—an archive that will speak or stay silent. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each lyrical return of shell, garden, sky thickens density until the final cadence shift (“today a door opened inward”). The Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4 and repaid at exit. No lens ambiguity; transitions are clean within the single scene. Cost is legible in the exact line: “winter in my chest, a precise cold,” a felt price that forecloses former isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of ink, breath, unlinking, and dripping stalactites intensifies toward a Charged Poise closure. The “margin blank where a verdict might have gone” reweights the entire premise, making the refusal of completion the decisive change with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught immediately (“marble sanctuary under aurora”), transitions are legible within one continuous scene, and the final image crystallizes options without exposition. No causal breaks; persistent constraint (mentor’s unfinished scrolls) shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo-tests tightens from silver-rope throw → braid of debts → shell → mother’s pot song, each loop reweighting meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: “I promise the water I will be a knot-maker…” reconfigures options with felt moral cost—he chooses tangle, not cut. Orientation and causality clean; no teleport, no amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the foreman’s lowered eyes and the silent torchlit harbor reconfigure power without a shouted verdict, the cost felt in the communal hush. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tapped dream, mapped dot, and shrine listening session layers density until the globe’s password reweights the official story. The melted snow globe’s final stillness crystallizes options: justice achieved through shared recognition rather than spectacle, the constraint of gentleness persisting.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of noticing → gathering → gifting. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the whisk transfer crystallizes the new communal stance; fireflies in the bowl make the cost of future neglect undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Price is persistent: the child now carries the burden of seeing. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds from first beat to last: shredded memo → rebuilt tech → recalibrated orchard → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“traded a curse for a calibration”—with social cost legible in the caretakers’ split response. Orientation is anchored by word 30, lens taught by word 120, pattern fully paid off. No teleporting props; the stuttering shredder and diamond states remain tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emptied jars and open windows reweight the poet’s vocation from hoarder to conduit, with the widow’s embrace as visible cost. Causal chain holds—box silent → wind releases note → jars capture → beach release—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation Teach is met: loft geography, dawn clock, and jar mechanic are anchored by word 80. One transition (loft → beach) is legible. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern taught early and paid in final lantern-image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality holds: because Marek studied the stone’s forgiveness, he can therefore offer sonic absolution; because she hears the chord, she therefore relinquishes ransom. Closure is the Earned Stasis of shared guardianship, cost legible in the stone’s low chord that “remembered drowned orchards.” Orientation secured by 120 words; lighthouse stair count acts as causal timer. No lens ambiguity; pattern of tuning taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image—ice seam, swallow threads, salt carried—adds density until the final “widening steadiness” reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“basalt sanctuary”), well within the 120-word grace; transitions are single-scene walk-and-return, so no orientation penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the village sets down ropes while the mapper’s final ledger page turns, a conceptual cost felt as “the world admit us like a house unlatching.” Persistent constraint—the need to keep watching—shapes every tactic, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: handing the lantern back to the night reweights the rule-set—light is for use, not storage—and the cost is legible in the supervisor radios going silent. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of salt-locked drains, missed nod, buried alarms accretes until the final refusal reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. Persistent constraint—metrics system vs. human witness—shapes every beat and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the thorn snags, therefore the heart can restart; because it ticks, Jonah must choose. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): ticking heart crystallizes options with felt cost in the booth. Cost is legible—“the booth filled with a silence that listened back.” Persistent constraint—Jonah must keep tomorrow’s time—shapes the final image; no slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bell begins “somewhere beyond sound,” re-weighting the workshop and sea; the chalk X on the hunter-hinge makes the cost of enabling the future legible. Causal lens holds: each kaleidoscope twist → ratio → teeth → timing culminates in the hinge’s kiss. No orientation debt; pattern taught by 25% mark. Persistent constraint: yearning algorithm stays unsatisfied, ensuring repeat toll. Minor hairline: “the cart drifted to a respectful halt” could more tightly fuse cart agency to Ilex choice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: lie → vault → Driftwood → Sink → exposure; each node tightens options. The “lyric challenge” gate and the recovered diary-in-code deliver a clear Decisive Change with visible job-risk cost. Closure lands on-page (“I chose voice”) and reconfigures the hush into surf—Resonant Reconfiguration earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each mirror-loan, shard-angle, and community nod follows because/therefore logic toward the Earned Stasis closure—peacekeeper elects to live there, mantle tightening. Orientation is immediate—basalt steps, ice bite, lantern pears—and the split-scene structure (orchard → vintage store → orchard) is cleanly cued and repaid when the reconstituted sphere hovers. Cost is palpable in the final line: “shadows lace me tighter.”

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: image-clusters (“fold in patience,” “rope remembering”) accrue until the final salute reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lifted parasol tip salute crystallizes the stance—“still a tourist but wandering the edges”—with felt conceptual cost (the deferred appointment). Persistent constraint is the unpaid appointment; it shapes nightly listening routines and the final delay call.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the folded scorched edge inside the map reweights both their futures with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—every gift and image loops back to prior specifics—and the final cadence shift (“verdicts loosen”) crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widening clearing and the cup sealed by prophet’s breath reweight the entire ritual with conceptual cost—their labor is infinite, necessary, unread. Causality is lyric but intact: because memory is skittish, therefore they sand breath; because the walker balances, therefore the clearing holds. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (pavilion lip, dune skin, ink pages). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten once at midday wind-beat, then crystallize at dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mirrored case reconfigures grief into shared ownership, the cost is the unspoken future labor they now owe the corridor; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added ribbon tightens pattern, not plot—though the “word-each” beat arrives late and slightly dilutes the final density.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sonic returns from the crystal thickens meaning rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by word 30; closure is a Charged Poise—the tilted crystal’s final hum reweights all prior cards. Cost is felt in the image of “forgiving ache of healed mistakes,” foreclosing the printers’ demand for a new volume. No lens ambiguity; one minor scaffold (“he lifts the crystal, from chandelier” paraphrase) keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of salt-thread, echo, and chalk-dust tightens until the final “shawl of tide” reweights memory itself. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“walked without choosing where”) and closure payoff is the prophet’s Earned Stasis—he resets the compass for tomorrow’s stranger, cost legible in the dropped chalk ticking like unlived metronome beats. No causal break; every image compounds texture that forecloses the option of ever holding time intact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the paused second-hand crystallizes the new listening stance and reweights the whole night’s labor. Causal chain holds—quake → misalignment → smeared photons → collar turn → sharp image—each step paid for with tactile effort. Cost is legible in the director’s bedside vigil and the weakest-tea dawn; no option is reset.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final breath is not described, but the shared silence reweights every prior song-of-the-mundane into an irreversible after-state. Causal chain is clean—blood-work alert → therapist call → son arrival → shard passed → breath thins—each beat narrowing options with visible emotional cost. Orientation is swift; who-where-when is anchored by word 60 and never loosens. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative pattern taught early holds through the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gold line slips under skin, reconfiguring meaning of noon and sealing the loop. Causality is lyric-accumulative—mirrors copy, key winds, shadows unfold—each beat deepens pattern rather than pivots. Orientation is taught early (“isle drifted like a patient lung”), waiver earned when the floating logic pays off in the final contract. Cost is visible in the ribbon under skin and the irreversible internalization of noon-without-sun.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    A single shard inside the maze: orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 4. Causal chain holds—finding tooth → meeting Ari → resetting bone → choosing truth—each step narrows options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: the tooth left under the fountain reweights all prior “mistakes into constellations” talk and forecloses silence at undeniable social cost. No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hedge-maze garden is micro-setting done tight: mint/iron air, muttering fountain, tooth in soil—every detail filters through bone-setter’s tactile gaze and constrains the shoulder-mending beat. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from lattice to bench to fountain stone. Weather (wind rearranging hedges) mirrors the shift in moral stance. Object-as-setting qualifies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: each circled stroke adds density until the garland reweights “light” from blaze to hush. Closure lands in Charged Poise—garland hung, village exhales, brother maybe returns to a world that has already renounced his promised star. Cost is the lifetime of salt and rasp compressed into every oval. No causal gaps; memory shards are cued by tactile present, never dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative-textural lens taught early: dripping icicles → constellation → burial ground. Closure is a Charged Poise: the exposed chain literalizes “future hand could tug,” re-pricing memory without reconciliation. Cost is felt in the shared kneel, cracked joints, and the vow to stop artistic cannibalism.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist chooses the river’s “footsteps and pauses,” foreclosing the market path with the felt cost of “closing pages turning above me.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of emblem-offerings reweights the stake until the contrary thread becomes legible. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“who, where, when” anchored in twilight mist at the nexus). No causality breaks; every emblem (letter, note, star-map) is causally offered and carried forward.

    Causal chain: Rowen arrives → teaches listening/singing → ritual night → village healed; each step proceeds clearly, but agency lies with Rowen while villagers witness, softening the Decisive Change. Closure image—“we hummed the low note, and the earth answered”—supplies a Resonant Reconfiguration: the village’s new consent is felt, cost is the old apathy now foregone. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. The penalty is that the villagers’ passivity means the closure’s price is vicarious rather than viscerally shared.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lake exhales, aurora moves, map becomes live—undeniable social cost now that navigation is possible again. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each orphaned object, each heartbeat-echo, accretes until the starlight braid reweights the world’s rule-set. No causal turns are required under this lens; the hush-boom beneath the “closed-eye” bark is the single tightening that reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the ampoule’s finite light—shapes every tactical decision and is pinched shut again in the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: leaving the timer behind reweights the entire premise—agreements between patience and pressure now belong to stone, not man. Causality is lyric but legible: each angled mapping and gear-tweak accumulates toward the final forfeiture. Cost is felt in the image of “one echo of his laugh” remaining—audible, irretrievable. Lens holds Accumulatively; pattern taught early, paid off in final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each burden adds density and reweights the dominant stake—translation of gravity—until the final “shelf where it could stand without gnawing” delivers a Charged Poise with felt cost. Causality is interior but coherent: each weighing teaches the narrator a grammar that cumulatively reconfigures posture toward love’s demand. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (grotto, starlight, lamp). No meaningful escalation break; pattern holds to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces naming the carving, the cloth bundle on the rain-cooled sill crystallizing that the hinge is refusal itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shaving, bead, and breath tightens the same stake—until the final image reweights “here and gone” as lived patience. Cost is visible in the unscarred tag notch and the sleeping-kettle cat. No orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught by iterative image knots: camera wheel, lagoon, carousel bones. Closure lands as Charged Poise—camera clicks sync with turbine sighs, reconfiguring time into “craft of breath.” Persistent constraint: scavenger must remain on raft, learning minutes by sighs; cost legible in final image without forward/back wind. Minor drift: “chronologically confused” premise floats free for ~180 words before pattern coheres, but payoff waives orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens: each micro-tweak (gutter to cistern, escalator reversed) layers density until the terminal’s lung reinflates. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—terminal exhales, intern breathes back—cost is embodied in the living hum, not speech. Orientation anchored by line 10; no drift. Tightening escalates via visible gauges, wet boots, mother’s thanks; options narrow to staying and maintaining.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream is neither built nor renounced but rehomed beside him, cost felt when “glacial hush turn[s] from marble to water under his ribs.” Accumulative lens holds throughout—pattern of silence, crystal echo, and ledger blankness deepening until the finch crystallizes the shift. No causality breaks; every image (key, clocks, rainlit crystal) is present or reweighted, not teleported. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet taught by word 30 (“soundless sanctuary”), waived because the payoff recharges the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the canal’s “truer city” reweights every prior refusal. Causal chain is clean—hook → box → ledger → engineer—each beat tightening agency. Orientation wavers for ~150 words (radio silence used as both dawn and dusk), but the ambiguity later pays off in the final hush, so the Orientation Test is waived. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator must now ferry a knowledge that disqualifies his family’s myths.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the dawn tableau—rope rewoven, seeds bundled, fisherman’s bow—crystallizes options and reweights the stake: knowledge now lives in future soil, not just memory. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each knot adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is undeniable: the collector’s solitary night, the risk of mis-reading, the surrender of secrecy to seeds. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (golden dock, snow, fisher-child fever). No causality breaks; even time’s yield is foreshadowed by “dock ticking like a clock.”

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the woman departs literally trailing the palace thread, her grief cartographically “explained into a breathing space,” a reconfiguration that costs the traveler part of his protective anonymity and us our certainty that absence can ever be mapped; the lyric-accumulative lens is taught by line 3 and held without waver.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza-layer adds sensory density (egg warmth vs. gear-cold) until cadence shift at hatching reweights stakes. Closure is Charged Poise—palace chains “singing,” mills tasting “rest,” dawn-creature bowing—reconfiguring meaning without explanatory coda; cost is conceptual (industrial halt, dynasty ceding control). No orientation debt: suspended palace/stalactite anchor arrives sentence 1. Minor causal gap: how silk-cable cradle tuning translates to biological incubation remains lyrically elided, but pattern teaches mythic logic early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of elemental echo (black sand, red thread, obsidian, graft) intensifies until the olive-tongue graft and coin-pinning reconfigure meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—“a tide worked steadily…”—where cost is felt as perpetual double duty, not explained. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: she must keep answering both fire and water, a price legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s “defiant hush” becomes promise, reweighting the entire breadcrumb pattern with conceptual cost—he will stay, box in hand, rain or not. The mosaic shards-as-keys rule is taught early, paid off when the bronze eyelid opens and memories “thread through air as evaporating silver.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each breadcrumb intensifies texture until the final cadence shift. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3, pattern legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the “share light without fire” pattern until the cool-petal transit reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by sonic echoes and petal geography; no anchor drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden keeps “troubling serenity,” foreclosing flame with felt constraint. Cost is visible in the perpetual re-counting the caretaker accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly returns, widening grief-rings, ribbon notches, and butterfly landings accrete until meaning reweights. Closure is Charged Poise—the final stone holds the kite-curve, crystallizing options without sentimental payoff. Orientation is swift: dusk, greenhouse bench, marble slab named within 40 words. One meaningful tightening: father’s hand steadies only after he chooses his daughter’s poem; that micro-turn reconfigures carving depth and emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the narrator once wounded neighbors with over-precision, therefore he now halts the pendulum at the crest of stillness to rewrite time itself; the pause is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the tower’s wider arc and the fisherman’s shared carving prove the before/after shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the empty patch is re-priced from absence to honored secret, marked by the sovereign case and poppies—cost is the gardener’s acceptance of complicity in silence. Causal chain holds: chess-clock cue → tapestry decode → empty grave → lover’s papers → new marker; no teleporting props or retro patches. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (silo, night, tools), and the mosaic of shards (silo, grave, poplar) is taught early and lands under a single lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the hinge decision reweights the entire city-archive premise, with the kingfisher’s dive crystallizing the cost of patience over force. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of frost, beads, threads, and hinges accrete meaning until the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. The only waiver-scale slip is a mild late abstraction—“future rearranges its furniture”—that slightly blurs the physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: each lyric refrain layers density until dust itself becomes articulate; closure is a Charged Poise—the floor murmuring with “fluent” ash while the narrator keeps conducting in sleep. Orientation is taught early (ember alcove, shortwave, famine aftermath) and pays off when the same ash re-enters as speaking text. The “promise to carry tempo forward” is the visible, felt cost that reconfigures the narrator’s future. No causality gaps; every image of ash, radio glow, or scored silence recurs with tightened meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the chair’s final slow-rock under the skylight crystallizes the shared cost of speaking slant; mother and daughter stand in “breathless quiet,” the path of direct naming forever foreclosed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ash, dust, and rocking rhythm accrete until the last gust-through-the-gallery reweights everything. Causality is tight—every gallery prop (mask, chair, powdered letters) is seeded in the first 200 words and returns with altered charge. One minor orientation waiver: “the room that holds our hush” is the only spatial anchor at the open, yet the lyric disorientation pays off when the same hush is finally filled with visitors’ footsteps.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the wheel catches, water sighs out, and the cost is the narrator’s future vulnerability now that the three factions have seen his power. Causal chain never loosens: cog → chalk records → sluice turn → immediate physical relief plus ideological recalibration. Orientation anchor (“sewer below the sunken city ruins”) lands within 30 words; the later flood-clock reference is an earned callback, not a patch. Lens is unambiguously causal; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that forecloses the option to stay neutral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each rehearsal layer adds density until the final charged poise of shared silence reweights the stake from “vanishing arts” to “listening survives us.” Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the rosette’s touch-line tracks cleanly from cabinet to closing circulation, providing a visible constraint. Orientation is immediate (velvet library, autumn dusk) and the single transition from rehearsal to performance is legible. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the art is no longer vanished because the room now “keeps their breath”—a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the soup circulates, synapses rewire, and the city’s discarded stories regain currency—cost is the chef’s future vulnerability. Causal chain holds: alignment → seed sprouts → pruning edits memory → communal tasting reconfigures social fabric. Orientation is swift—rusted greenhouse, drowned district, celestial clock—all within 60 words. One lens ambiguity: is the tree’s growth literal or metaphor? The final image reweights the premise either way, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is crystal: blackout → tower restart → keeper must decide who deserves the queen tone. The riddle beat is a causal gate, not ornament—fail and the hive stays mute—so the keeper’s openness is weaponized against him. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the queue reforms, the ritual returns, but the keeper has forfeited anonymity; the cost is felt in the final line’s “no pocket for delay.” Orientation anchors (tower, dusk, post-blackout) appear by line 4; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cottage adds density and pattern break until the final conceptual reweighting—“houses live on our pauses.” Orientation is secure by line 6; transitions are legible. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the narrator’s own ritual of attention now perpetuates the life he sought to decode. No causal break; one meaningful tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time pours “wide,” the city learns delay is strategy, the scholar’s certainty re-opens. Causal chain holds—reveal → scholar recoil → threading → diffusion of decision—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“I am Oris…”) and spatial logic never breaks. Persistent constraint: the lattice breach remains a “listening wound,” a price that keeps shaping future argument.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corridor is accepted as a “remembering instrument.” Cost is abstract; reader feels pressure but no concrete forfeiture. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—images layer, cadence deepens—yet no single pattern-break intensifies stakes. Orientation clear early; no causality breaks, but escalation is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the last gold dot crystallizes the reciprocal circuitry of kindness, reweighting every prior gift. Accumulative lens holds—each portrait, note, and offering layers density until the neighbor’s map confirms the pattern. Cost is legible in the moment she accepts mutual exposure, surrendering her safe solitude. The greenhouse hush becomes a miniature republic whose border is crossed forever.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator swears seasonal return, foreclosing safe museum distance; cost is the lifelong nectar-armor of caretaking. Causal chain holds: bread初试 → wax软 → lens择 → vow, each because/therefore tightening options. Lens-as-selector rule is taught early and paid off in the mist test. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the yoyo’s ascent snuffs the door and re-weights “being escorted” vs. choosing the keeper. Causal chain holds: reverse-yoyo logic → stone opens → visions paid in blood → refusal costs futureless mornings. Orientation is anchored by skiff arrival and lantern placement; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored corridor thickens the density of self-alienation until the camera flash crystallizes the trap. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the funhouse mouth seals yet the clasp remembers the trick; cost is felt in the sliver of daylight that can still slam shut. Causality holds through the paradox rule-set; no prop or rule appears without prior seed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard still afloat, the prophet seated among humming pears, the sky’s “greener note” reweighting every prior beat under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each dub and strike visibly steers drift, timbre, and finally the storm’s mouth—so the cost is audible in the exhausted silence that follows the tower of crates. Orientation is taught immediately (“At the blue hour the orchard drifted…”) and repaid when the same blue folds into the resonant hush at the end. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the lattice of fractal holes and the net of knives are both set up and played.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist steps into the corridor, ready to be measured—options narrowed, cost legible, lens held. Causal chain is tight: mother’s lost expedition → copper tag → pattern grammar → corridor opening → voluntary self-offering. Orientation is taught early by tactile cues (sandals on shell, reed whistle), so the surreal geography never disorients. One minor slack: the watchers’ spacing shift answers the question almost too cleanly, but the cost remains on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger survives, names are restored, and "Listen" reframes the town’s memory with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—because the rose petal falls, the narrator enters; because the ledger trembles, truth is salvaged—yet the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of found objects and marginalia tightens the moral stakes rather than a plot chain. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (iron key, ivy station, coal scar). One minor scaffold: "I chart what I find by drawing parallels" tells method after the fact; the parallels themselves are shown. Overall the pattern coheres and the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each slip of paper layers absence into pattern; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—"map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer" reweights prior material with cost of witness. Orientation is late; "drowned promenade" not anchored until ~130 words, but the disorientation serves the payoff and is waived. No causal rupture, one legible shard, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the generators’ return tries to re-coat the world with hum, yet the reclaimed stillness clings—cost felt in “my breath.” Accumulative lens holds: blackout → stillness → stamp-test → ledgers confess → stance crystallizes. No causal gaps; orientation anchors by line 3; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shadow touches but does not reattach, loosening grief’s weight without restoring the lost part—cost is the permanent partial absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lantern crane adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning under sky. Causality is lyrical but coherent; nothing teleports, and the basilica’s rules (dream recording, descending stairs) are established before they matter. The ending’s felt cost is unmistakable in the phrase “the ache no longer drags at the world around his ankles.”

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is present—blast → geode → hunt for slack → perturb valley → mark basin—but the mid-story sags into accumulative lyric loops; the closure beat (“I swear I can feel it lift us”) is a resonant reconfiguration with cost, yet the lens ambiguity (causal vs. accumulative) persists until the final paragraph, slightly blunting the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank glyphs are re-inked as rests where breath = belonging, reweighting the whole sky-to-text premise with undeniable social cost. Causal engine is light—mostly pattern accumulation—but the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the final cadence. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 5. The cost is legible in the hush that “is both shelter and proof,” satisfying the 9+ cost test; minor slack comes from the pilgrim’s late interior access.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice is taut: because the narrator forged driftwood records, therefore Mara’s grief was misnamed, therefore he must return to the shore to unmake the lie. The watch hand acts as both prop and proof, turning the final beat when Mara lifts it and the past flips. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s future “inheritance is spoken and cooked,” not archived—cost is the surrender of counterfeit authority. Transitions (terrace → beach → terrace) are cleanly lit by dusk and lamp-light anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emptied parapet and cooling drawer pull reweight every prior exchange with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—moon-phase synchronization → delayed arrival → trades under clipped coin → final solitude—each step foreclosing alternatives. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 20. Cost is legible in the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a taut Charged Poise: the compass against the sternum reweights every prior failure without declaring victory. Causal lattice is tight—every pole hum propels the next tactical choice; no off-stage rescue. The “utility-pole method” is taught early and paid off in the channel extraction, so lens holds. Cost is unmistakable: the same brass that once reflected a “jittery mouth” now seals an unbroken, still cracked, self—steady, not fixed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the baseball cools, the lake offers “rings of useful ache,” reweighting the premise that amnesia could absolve. Causal chain holds: newspaper decoding → rumor → descent → confession → decision to stay. One minor orientation debt—city geography is never anchored—but the haze serves the noir-fable tone and is paid off by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator becomes a ‘passage’ and loses plain speech, paying the promised price; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each spice, breath, and beast-circle thickens the ritual until the final braided-air image crystallizes the new state with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of carrying “cloudbound repentance home like milk” reweights time itself as something now carried, not retrieved, with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stalled second named and released layers density until the clock-face becomes “only openings where hours breathed.” Orientation is taught by the saucer-crack map and paid off when the same crack is whispered thanks into at the end. The persistent constraint—guilt that can only be re-lived, not erased—shapes every tactic and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator forecloses the conqueror path, seals the promise with breath, and the cost—perpetual solitude and stewardship—is felt in the final image. Causal chain (grief→weight→lock→balance→entry) holds without gaps; the lock’s weight-logic is taught early and obeyed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: jar-line density increases, night hush pattern breaks with sideways ash exhalation, reweighting village safety stake. Closure—lightning stars released—earns resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: her anonymity sacrificed to living prophecy. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: sentinel keeps post but now guards consent, price paid is lifelong duplicity limned in “warm bronze…owning neither ink nor chain.” Causal lattice holds: blackout → coded sundial → quill circuit → dimmed fort, each because/therefore legible. Lens ambiguity waived—pattern taught early, payoff lands clean. Cost is unmistakable in final hush image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because the narrator clings to promise → seeks herder → accepts her rule → trades places. The spiral-door beat (tightening) is dramatized with felt cost to both siblings and the herder, satisfying closure. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“tidal bluff under aurora”) and who-what cues. One soft spot: the dust’s physics is asserted not tested, a trace causality wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet’s finger on the scar-constellation reweights the city and the self in one visible image. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each thunder-storm page-turn thickens the atlas of pain until the dome’s flicker offers a legible route. The envelope, timer, and storm are taught early; transitions are seamless. Cost is felt in the hush after the last bolt—language itself rarefied into breathable map—though the caretaker’s exposition slightly cushions the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the floor-shadow gate reweights the entire code-hunt, cost is the atrium itself lost to sky. Causal linkage holds: needle-card → sundial angles → shadow gate; each because/therefore step is on-page. Orientation anchored by 40-word mark; disorientation later pays off when glass becomes sky. No lens ambiguity; accumulation of reflected increments tightens the stake until the gate demands traveler not applause.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt door’s click becomes an almost-promise, crystallizing the new library as lived resistance; cost is felt in the poet’s cracked persona and the skyline’s “teeth marks.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of copper, pages, and bodies builds until the final hush reweights the stake. Causality holds: each poetic object (pennies, tin, lantern) is handled, not teleported. Orientation is clear by line 20; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station hush after the delayed last train is the audible proof that his encore has derailed the script without wrecking the world. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (tide-leaves, flickering compasses, film hiss) layers density until the timetable itself yields. Cost is legible in the final line: “schedules bowed.” Causality is intact but soft; the arbor’s physics are dream-logic, yet the story teaches that rule-set early and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through scent-testimony, pollen rain, and backward-counting conch until the monsoon comma-punctuation affirms the planted memory. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ridge “blooms in vowels that will not wash away,” re-weighting the premise that stories must survive erosion. Cost is felt in the soaked hair, the surrendered monopoly on waking, and the visible thread of light that sorts myth from boast. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no causality breaks; lyrical sequencing stays legible under accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the upright needle and lace brightened to muted cerulean reconfigure the rule-set—apologies can be released but not retrieved—cost is the relinquishing of control itself. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salt-grass step deepens the pattern until the tide reweights meaning. Orientation is taught by the compass cue at word 60; no caps triggered. One of the cleanest 800-word arcs I’ve seen.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: recovery is "not a rescue but a rehearsal." Cost is unmistakable—the drowned tomatoes, broken panes, lost data—and the final image of resettling dust reweights all prior action. Orientation is immediate ("After the flood... greenhouse"), and the pattern of observation-as-experiment is taught by line 3 and paid off in the slide work. No causality breaks; every beat deepens the central ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist crystallizes a third path (annealed response) that forecloses vengeance or silence, with conceptual cost embedded in the fused ledger-window. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story deepens via sensory layering (frost, soot, resonance) until the final image reweights silence as testimony. Cost is legible in “purpose pour[ing] through the emptiness I shaped,” where artistic void becomes moral vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator endures not by restoring sound but by reconfiguring perception, crystallized in the final image of carrying the case “like a lantern” through reciprocal quiet. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density and pattern refinement (failed first attempt → calibrated system). Cost is legible: the forsaken tuning forks, blistered lilies, and irreversible loss of auditory world. Every shard reinforces the central paradox: meaning persists despite impossible silence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the library becomes a permanent registry, transforming distress signals into addresses, with visible cost—the undertaker remains below, redefining his role. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered images (kelp, glass, tide times) that culminate in the SOR code. Causality is maintained through motivated ellipsis: each action (descending, aligning shards, tapping code) follows from prior knowledge and emotional stakes. The inciting package and climax (beacon release) are tightly linked by the lens’s “salt memory,” and the ending’s dry sigh confirms irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s meaning shifts from secrecy to communal gratitude, reweighting anonymity into shared dignity with social cost (lists, raids). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via constellations, exchanges, and tightening runs—culminating in spring’s “more names without fear.” Cost is legible in frost prints, carrot tops, and the patrol’s near-miss. Every shard coheres under this lens, taught by the first paragraph’s “amplified quiet.”

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass room becomes a door, the storage closet unlatches, and unused love is released—not resolved, but reconfigured with palpable cost (emptied jars, relinquished hoarding). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density builds via breath, bloom, and box until the final cadence shift (“bridge hums like a tuning fork”). Every image serves the arc; no disorientation penalty—anchors are clear by line 20. Cost is legible in “attic lungs” and “chairs stand without coats.”

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the halo becomes a ring, laying a path that hums with earned reverie, foreclosing escape while accepting perpetual fading. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each hyperbolic fold deepens the cost of memory until the final stasis feels inevitable. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“hedge maze designer… roots that walk above streams”), and disorientation serves closure (time as photograph).
