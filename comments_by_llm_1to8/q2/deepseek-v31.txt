  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Aris abandons her protective certainty ("Her grand narrative of tragedy decayed") and accepts vulnerability by leaving the roof open to "more dust, more potential." The accumulative lens holds as each dust discovery reweights her stance toward loss.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive lens with clear closure: Lyra's discovery leads to purposeful action, transforming her from passive survivor to active architect of revelation. The cost is visible—she must risk exposure and use her painful past (glass artistry) to expose the truth. The frost-to-ledger-to-relay chain maintains tight causality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from trauma through experimentation to synthesis, with the final image of frost transforming into visual symphony providing clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern of silence-as-music early and pays it off when vibration transforms frost into art. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with clear who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the broken lens accumulating meaning through descent, discovery, and repair, culminating in grandfather's dissolution into light. Closure lands with visible cost as grandfather finally finds rest. Slight dock for predictable beats in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Kael's discovery reweights the entire community narrative from external dependence to internal strength. The cost is legible in Maever's decades of hoarding and trembling hands. The piece teaches its pattern early through the bell ritual and pays it off when Kael prepares to "give them a different story."

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear closure - Elara finds the tear and transforms from artist to healer with visible emotional cost (weeping, falling to knees). The past life memory effectively frames the quest. Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of fragment → vision of mother → understanding maze as temporal equation → using fragment to unbend time. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (mother returns, photographs disintegrate) with visible cost (the loop that bound them dissolves). The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the hyperbolic geometry concept meaningfully constrains the resolution method.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from infiltration through decoding to self-entrapment, with the Wall's collapse providing urgency. The Earned Stasis closure (choosing imprisonment to protect seeds) lands with clear cost: "Trapped, but the seeds were safe." The arrow-as-cipher discovery drives the middle turn effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara gains understanding but accepts the human weakness behind betrayal, with visible emotional cost ("fell back from the forge"). The causal chain from searching gaps in information to finding the forge to experiencing the memory holds well. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (underwater location unclear until "submersible") and some abstraction of the cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from flower codes to theft to improvised escape, with clear closure as Elara succeeds but experiences the weight of being an "unworthy guardian." The moonbeam extraction sequence provides excellent specificity. Slight weakness in not establishing earlier what listening to destiny's door means concretely, though the final beat pays this off adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the drip-drip-drip rhythm and glass-crafting accumulate toward Elara's abandonment of guilt, with the bookmark as tangible cost. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she renounces her past tie with "weighty lightness," foreclosing return. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara, abandoned control room, during thaw).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through Leo conquering his phobia to retrieve evidence, with cost rendered in physical/emotional terms ("gasping and weeping"). The causal chain from betrayal to self-transformation to necessary action is clean, though the coordinates decryption feels slightly mechanical. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered descriptions of silence until the gold leaf flake's landing "perfectly over a central swirl" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is legible in "nothing left to listen for"—her life's purpose fulfilled means losing her defining obsession. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Unit 734's understanding transforms from seeking a place to recognizing thought as process - "the music created by the friction between possibilities." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and timeline fragments build toward this revelation. Cost is legible in the robot's willing surrender of its fractured existence to achieve understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of lens → investigation of discrepancy → revelation of fraud → moral choice → destruction of evidence. The closure lands as Earned Stasis where Anya refuses to complete the record, with visible cost in betraying her archival duty. The orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the single-scene structure maintains unity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Earned Stasis - Elara's continued polishing after the confrontation shows endurance with visible cost ("blooming withering in her chest"). The accumulative lens holds as the marbles' significance deepens from personal ritual to proof of the garden's memory. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the estate ownership context and the somewhat convenient timing of Cederic's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Vesh's universe "forever shifted sideways" with the cost of his former certainty visibly paid through "no trace of ice left." The causal lens holds throughout—each lever adjustment builds toward the boundary-thinning climax where a future creature acknowledges them. Orientation anchors cleanly (station, aviary, characters' roles) by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's act transforms the building's decay into artistic completion, with visible cost in the hall's structural release. The accumulative lens holds as water damage reveals patterns, building to the final resonant frequency. The piece teaches its logic early (water as reagent) and pays it off through the building's "mighty, musical exhalation."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Excellent causal structure with a Decisive Change closure - Rhys discovers proof validating his impossible observation, fundamentally altering his relationship to certainty and the world's preparedness. The cost is palpable: his "certainty was gone, replaced by a terrifying freedom." Minor orientation delay (weather station context comes late) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from exploration → valve discovery → spectral revelation → truth uncovered, with clear cost ("weight of it settled firmly in her own hands"). The foreman's tragic choice between crew and town creates genuine moral complexity. Minor deduction for slightly convenient resolution timing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from disturbance to descent to healing, with the origami swan providing earned revelation. The closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("Exhausted, Elara sat back on her heels"), though the conceptual weight of her shift from observer to actor could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Leo's smile and hand gesture, with visible emotional cost (tear). The accumulative structure coheres well through eclipse/vial/sound convergence. Slight opacity around the magical realism of the hair curl's resonance prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alistair becomes "the wall" with clear cost (accepting role as tomb's scribe). The accumulative structure coheres well through diary discoveries to final stance, though the displaced axis concept could integrate more causally with the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with Lena rowing toward "that new, uncertain, and beautiful key" - a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in her determination. The accumulative structure coheres well through fortune-writing, signal-sending, and Lena's response. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of all elements.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from descent to confrontation to resolution, with the loop pedal strategy driving the plot logically. The closure (Carver's restoration through illuminating the entity's paradox) lands with clear cost - the exhausted white pigment. The orientation is immediate and the because/therefore linkage holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through memory-mapping to symphony crescendo, landing with Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara transforms homesickness from "wound" to "melody." Cost is viscerally felt through physical collapse and acceptance that "that door was closed." The nautilus shell's spiral geometry elegantly links natural time to memory's exponential expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure—Kael stepping off the edge and allowing the fall—delivers a Decisive Change with clear conceptual and emotional cost, reversing his core trait. The causal chain from fractured memories through acceptance holds, though the "infinite space between the drop and the ripple" resolution edges toward abstraction rather than concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through vibration patterns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "sacred" with clear emotional cost. The progression from individual teaching to public performance creates meaningful tightening. The closure lands with visible cost in the "wave of quiet approval" that Inara feels as warmth on her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: discovery leads to lateral connection of data points, which compels action with clear cost—Elara knowingly endangers herself by exposing the truth. The Charged Poise closure works well, crystallizing her options with undeniable pressure as she waits for retribution. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the follower's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from lantern delivery through memory revelation achieves Decisive Change - Silas moves from confused grief to understanding his tears as response to recovered joy. The cost is visible in "tears for the beauty of the memory" and the painful return of buried love. The because/therefore linkage holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Aris's circular rope placement forecloses enlightenment with visible cost ("the texture of time...was not a thing to be felt"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation and the mirror-moment payoff, though the energy beings' proposition arrives somewhat abruptly at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: the single sustained note transforms from seeking beauty to receiving conversation with the dead, with felt cost in "heartbreaking chorus." The bowl's shift from alms-receiving to sound-focusing provides causal throughline, though the rainforest burning backstory slightly dilutes present-frame immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the grotto sequence building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's first genuine emotion emerges from creating the "perfect replica" she cannot truly access, with clear emotional cost. The piece teaches its pattern of manufactured versus genuine feeling early and pays it off. Orientation anchors established within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from symphony to library delivery, with the locket discovery driving the connection. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters' isolation transforms into connection, with visible emotional cost in Maeve's response. The "cycles of compassion" theme lands through concrete action. Slight weakness in the convenience of the misaddressed envelope backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelin's sculpture dedication transforms both the arbor's meaning and their place in community, with clear cost (abandoning individual recognition). The accumulative lens holds as tags build toward pattern revelation. Slight deduction for the convenience of the final tag's placement and overly neat resolution of the artist's identity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change closure with Elara's choice to sacrifice her pendant's power. The causal chain from detecting the flaw to reaching the Spire to making the sacrifice holds together. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand she loses her "last link to the past" but don't experience the weight of that loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from trying to solve emotion to understanding it as landscape to be mapped. The cost is legible - she must abandon her original quest for equations and accept ambiguity. The accumulative structure coheres through mathematical imagery building to the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal linkage from blackout to discovery to revelation, with the tape fragment functioning as a concrete catalyst. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—Elara's act redeems Finch posthumously while accepting her own continued invisibility. Minor orientation lag in the opening paragraph slightly dulls initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris shifts from control to witness, with the linden leaf serving as catalyst and final memorial. The cost is palpable—three years of failed methodology abandoned, data tablet dark. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the storm's sensory pressure building toward stance crystallization. Slight deduction for predictable arc that follows expected beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange transforms saltwater to freshwater, with cost visible in sacrificing the amber (preserved past) and bread (present survival). The accumulative lens holds as rain patterns lead to discovery, then convergence demands offering. Minor orientation wobble with the woman's sudden appearance slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Elara holding the pearl and understanding replacing raw power - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the pilgrim's collapse, the cave's trauma). The causal chain from arrival to resolution tracks cleanly. However, the shadows' nature and the light-multiplication solution feel mechanically convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from exile to return to staged revelation to final acceptance, with the trumpet valve serving as the crucial linking element. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the community's relationship to their history transforms with visible emotional cost (tears, solemn procession). The memorial's sudden decoding feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality. Who/where/when are anchored early and the single-scene structure holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from midnight departure through discovery to threshold crossing. The closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (trading certainty for infinite mystery). The orientation is clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the cost being more stated than viscerally felt in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from discovery through nightly experiences to final broadcast, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost is felt in Elias's surrender of skepticism. Slight deduction for the predictable arc once the magic begins - the middle lacks surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure as Elara exploits the storm-induced instability through her dimensional awareness and cursed fragment to achieve escape, with clear cost (fragment's destruction, facing unknown consequences). The "achieved her goodbye" resonates as earned change. Slight deduction for compressed middle mechanics that could use one more beat of tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the passport discovery reweights every prior memory with visible emotional cost ("heavier, more complex grief"). The "fair trade" motif transforms from seeking retribution to understanding sacrifice. Minor orientation delay (father's identity as con artist emerges gradually) serves the revelation structure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from physical ascent through sensory collection to temporal visions, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as she transforms ephemeral perceptions into "portable whole." The cost is legible in "body stiff" and the isolation of her "solitary harvest." Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from individual fragments (wedding ring, confession) to systemic pattern (deliberate erasures). The poison label discovery triggers a resonant reconfiguration that reweights all prior disappearances from random to "systematized removal." Closure lands with Charged Poise as he becomes "keeper of the silence," the cost legible in accepting permanent erasure to bear witness. Who/where/when anchored clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's discovery reweights her entire career from myth-busting to myth-making, with clear cost (her remaining days). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and emotional resonance build toward the revelation. The Signal's transformation from atmospheric interference to alien archive lands with proper weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Rio shifts from resistance to navigation, with the net-mender's proposal crystallizing this pivot. The foundation stone chip anchors past/future tension effectively. Cost is implied through "cold undercurrent" but could be more visceral at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Charged Poise closure with Elara standing ground as machines arrive, crystallizing her witness role with palpable cost. The accumulative structure builds through timing mechanism to earthrise to machine arrival coherently. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. Cost is legible in "choosing to outlast" against the approaching "desecration."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from damaged drone discovery through water-based diagnosis to successful repair launch achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (time pressure of departing ship). The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph, and the because/therefore linkages hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovering the underground river transforms from triumph to witnessing "a silent, final chapter," with clear cost in Elara becoming "the editor of an atlas with only one true entry left." The accumulative structure builds through falcon observation, condensation map, ice journey, and discovery, each layer deepening the dominant stake. The "worrying tranquility" that bookends the piece gains devastating weight through this reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with visible transformation—the town achieves "a perfect, eternal memory, humming softly"—with clear cost in the form of accepting memory over physical restoration. The accumulative structure builds through rhythmic repetition (tap-step, hum-step, pause-step) that deepens with each pass until echoes manifest. The archway's transformation from failing to glowing provides concrete evidence of change, while the constraint of impending collapse shapes all tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Elias transforms from intruder to steward through accepting the memories, with cost visible in risking death ("oxygen alarm blaring"). The accumulative structure coheres as atmospheric details build toward the final image of "no longer alone." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen's truth-telling through the lattice transforms both the Warden and his inheritance. The cost is legible in his confrontation with family shame and the weight of "bodies yet to be found." Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, chapel) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost's release transforms the orchard from decay to thriving life, with visible cost in both the ghost's unraveling and Elara's mixed tear. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and the final cadence shift. The bead discovery and vision sequence provide clear causal linkage to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as nightly rituals compound into transformation, with the water following quartz threads as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the entire journey. The cost is visible in Thea's exhaustion and the community's lost precedents, though the transformation's mechanics occasionally strain plausibility without fuller grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure that builds through discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where nature's completion of the sundial reweights Elara's entire journey. The cost is felt in her acceptance that "interruption could create a new, more beautiful path." The closure lands cleanly with the tree-as-gnomon insight transforming her understanding of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael's analog rebellion crystallizes in the final image of him melting into the crowd. The cost is felt through "futuristic nostalgia" and the ephemeral nature of his chalk codes. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural accumulation of details (chalk, letters, margins) creates meaningful density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's crystallized understanding and tactical shift, with clear cost implied in the coming confrontation. The hybrid lens holds coherently, shifting from atmospheric setup to causal resolution. The constraint of Elara's indirect teaching method shapes tactics meaningfully. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Earned Stasis closure where Elara's acceptance of the unsent letters forecloses reconciliation with visible cost ("the weight of the cedar box gone from her spirit"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through the window messages toward the crystallized understanding that "The choice is not the point."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with brain coral pattern recurring from cast to natural form to surgical map, each iteration reweighting meaning. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the "paralyzing charge" gone but "old wound remains," showing clear before/after with felt cost. The experimental surgery based on her decoded patterns pays off the setup elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finds her lost joy through collaboration across time. The fragment discovery catalyzes meaningful change, and the final "pensive mirth that acknowledged all that was lost while celebrating what could still be found" carries felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear nested awakenings (coin's message, hidden mural layer, final dome revelation) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is conceptual but legible - abandoning restoration work for discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with Elara's deliberate act transforming the surveillance system - a Decisive Change with clear cost (risking capture, destroying their language). The lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from warning to action. Slight weakness in the convenience of the "mouldering texts" solution appearing exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's translation of the armistice lullaby transforms the planetary hum from "scream to sigh," with clear cost in her centuries of loneliness and failure. The accumulative lens holds throughout with density increases building to the revelation. Orientation anchors (poet, night, settlement) establish clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Aeliana transforms from passive keeper to active rekindler, with visible cost (the silver light fading from her). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the crack→search→transformation sequence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the cracked inkwell transforms from symbol of past clarity to instrument of present understanding - "No words were needed to restore trust after silence; the symphony they had built together said everything." The accumulative build from linguistic to emotional promises coheres beautifully. Cost is visible in accepting the flaw as essential.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from dilemma through discovery to synthesis solution, with clear closure showing Isla implementing her bypass design. The cost is visible in her relief and the risk she took defying the Council's direct order. The orientations (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through dust-reading, meteorite-balancing, and music discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara releases Argos, accepting risk to preserve the songs. The cost—abandoning her carefully maintained isolation—is visible when she breaks her self-imposed rule. The composer's backstory integrates smoothly as discovered artifact rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding transforms the Terrace from maze to "map of consequence," with visible cost in confronting her father's trauma. The accumulative structure coheres as grain patterns reveal the flight's significance, though the Chinese character "潜在" creates a brief orientation hiccup.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers the "celestial event in the deep" - polyps dancing like stars - fundamentally reweighting her understanding of landscape astrology. The cost is visible in her years of isolation and failed attempts, paid off when she broadcasts her discovery. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the revelation that "The landscape was not a barrier; it was the text itself."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively: Finn's understanding that forgetting is an active burial rather than passive decay reweights all prior gaps with conceptual cost. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and emotional fragments build toward this revelation through the seed's panoramic vision.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the family's joy validates Silas's artistic philosophy while he remains invisible. The "ordered randomness" concept drives the entire structure, and cost is legible in his anonymity and the ephemeral nature of his art. The orientation anchors (tidal arcade, festival setting) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Aria transforms from exile to cosmic constellation through the tattoo's completion. The moonstone dust creating internal shift ("a profound shift occurred within her") provides visible transformation with cost (pain, exile, forbidden act). Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elian's shifted perspective, with visible cost in his prior frustration and the impending port expansion that will "shift everything." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the ripple epiphany that reweights his entire craft.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Elias shifts from theft/preservation to key/translation, with visible cost in his "traded smooth skin and peaceful nights." The accumulative texture builds through fire/moon/stars/dance imagery that reweights at closure when he becomes ready to "speak his hard-won, universal language." The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and pays it off through micro-choices (sitting, opening, holding, standing).

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with multiple balloon releases building to the breakthrough moment. The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Elara's equation reframes hope from abstract concept to cultivatable condition. However, the personal cost remains more conceptual than visceral - we see the transformation but don't feel what Elara sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to testimony, with the film negative triggering revelation and forcing Elara's choice to share the burden. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Elara transforms from solitary listener to public witness. Orientation anchors effectively by paragraph two. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where mirrors temporarily show "what could be" - the garden possibility - with explicit cost (borrowed heartbeat/life force given). The accumulative structure coheres through light/prism imagery building to the mirror transformation. Slight dock for the cost being somewhat conceptual rather than more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands through the handshake moment with visible cost ("a breath that seemed to last an eon"). The accumulative structure builds through ritual, memory, and negotiation to crystallize in "the fragile, beautiful flaw of a peace hard-won," though the middle section could tighten its causal linkage between memory and present action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias releases the egg, transforming from "jailer" to liberator with visible cost (losing the incalculable fossil). The causal lens holds: his manufactured drought → storm breaks control → realization → release. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. The "chaos variable" typo and slight ambiguity in the Chinese character prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with threads literally accumulating into transformation. The prism's dissolution creates clear Decisive Change with visible cost—Elara becomes conduit for "thousand subdued lives." Orientation anchors cleanly (courtyard, moonlit snow, Elara at center). The "harvest of echoes" returning to owners satisfies closure with felt weight of "might-have-beens."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through density increase and pattern break, culminating in Elara's complete reversal of method that lands with visible cost (destroying her work, entering Kael's space). The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration through role inversion with clear before/after legibility. Slight deduction for the "half-lit epiphany" section that momentarily abstracts rather than embodying the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas's act of knotting the moth wing transforms his temporary structures from guides into monuments, with visible cost in accepting impermanence. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3. The closure lands with felt cost as he accepts his transient role as a "temporary knot in the fabric of time."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the bronze card represents both technical success and emotional transformation with visible cost (the lost choir). The rope's reconfiguration creates a decisive turn that enables the resolution. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the rope's function, though this serves the discovery arc.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Foresight's transcendence through understanding represents a conceptual repricing with felt cost (its entire existence was misunderstood). The storm-triggered seal-breaking creates coherent pressure toward revelation. Cost is legible in "grand and tragic error of implementation" though could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing - Elara's worldview transforms from quantification to acceptance of mystery, with clear cost (abandoning her life's methodology). The causal chain from failed attempts to surrender to revelation holds cleanly. Slight deduction for the entity manifestation feeling somewhat convenient despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change - Kael releases resentment and the ghostly melody emerges, with clear emotional cost in his surrender of duty. Causal chain holds: Lyra's argument about memory → Kael's recognition → release → melody manifestation. Slight opacity around "cellular memory" mechanics prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where synchronized breathing allows dream-city and ruined orchard to coexist permanently. The cost is legible: Elara must surrender her "firmly grounded" physics-only worldview. Accumulative lens holds throughout with density increase toward the crystalline transformation. Orientation anchors (mirror maker, workshop, orchard) established within first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change when Elara leaves the cathedral for first time in a decade and the wreckers are "delayed indefinitely," with visible cost in abandoning her sanctuary. The causal chain holds but the Council's reversal feels slightly convenient despite the symbolic apple gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from passive curator to active inheritor with visible cost (abandoning her prescribed duty). The vision sequence effectively reweights the shell from empty vessel to cosmic inheritance. Slight deduction for the vision's abstract quality reducing immediate cost legibility, though the final image of walking toward the telescope grounds the change.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain leads to Resonant Reconfiguration where understanding absence becomes salvation. The library as "empty spaces thrumming with potential" delivers conceptual cost through lessons learned too dearly. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding that Idris became the narrative itself. The cost is legible in her acceptance of becoming the keeper of forgotten names, anchored to the ship. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with who (Elara), where (abandoned carnival ship), and when (after Idris's death).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story delivers a clear Decisive Change where Elara repairs reality's tear, with visible cost in the physical strain ("shuddered in her bones") and risk of destabilization. The causal chain from finding the seal to recognizing it as a blueprint works well, though the mechanism of how she knows to reconfigure the rope feels slightly convenient despite the "apocryphal margins" justification.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the violent energy transforms into "bloom of hush" with visible cost (Kaelyn "sank to her knees, breathless"). The ice-crack patterns as sonic pathways provides excellent causal linkage. Slight deduction because the energy beings' departure happens off-page, weakening the before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from thistle seed to beacon light through pattern accumulation—each vision deepens understanding until the final beam "pierces the darkness." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes she's sent a response signal, reweighting all prior isolation with connection's possibility. Cost is visible in "weeks" of calculation and the "crushing weight of failure" before success. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the post-collapse setting.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Lyra's realization that "the act of looking, of seeking meaning, was the identity itself" reconfigures her role from external archivist to integrated memory. Cost is visible in her acceptance of entombment. Deduction for slight orientation delay and some causality softness in the shadow-reading mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with the mosaic discovery as the pivotal turn that reweights Sparrow's purpose from mere display to "conversation with history." The closure (people rising) lands with visible cost - they bear the weight differently now. The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the jade cicada bridges past and present, with visible emotional cost in Kael's "anger visibly softened into recognition, then wistfulness." The accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture through tidal pools, time's weave, and the vision. Orientation anchors established within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's gift of the doll to the trellis, with visible cost (surrendering her "only comfort"). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase from underground compression to expansive sky, culminating in the planted silence. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from train whistle echo through crystalline resonance to "vaulting hush." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as silence transforms from void to blanket, with visible cost shown through the old woman's physical relief. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the piece teaches its pattern of acoustic manipulation early.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: mural discovery → journey to waterfall → orchard infiltration → obtaining the stellar map that redefines the throne's nature. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the throne transforms from "prize for a conqueror" to "responsibility for one who remembered," with the cost being Kaelen's abandonment of his former role. The twist that the stairway is a navigational route rather than physical stairs reweights the entire quest. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (world-building takes ~150 words to fully anchor).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the youth achieves solitary breathing with "potential" replacing "loaded absence." Cost is visible in the burning iron touch and Kael's dissolution. The accumulative build through scar-sharing to final transformation holds well, though the mechanism of Kael's disappearance feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from cryptic messages through physical manifestation to decisive action, with clear cost (risk of being "gem-cut into a million pieces"). The closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible transformation of the bolt into diamond. The quantum promise concept integrates naturally into the plot mechanics rather than remaining abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong accumulative structure building through the gramophone operation to the grandfather's confession—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the family's entire history. The cost is legible in "a truth that would forever bind him to this place" and the final image of being held in "a quiet, gilded embrace." The standing wave mechanism is well-integrated into the revelation's delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Valerius liberates both the marionette and himself, with visible cost in abandoning his knight identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mystical elements and symbolic gestures build toward the transformation, though the "Choose and complete" directive feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Elias's transformed understanding of his work, with visible emotional cost ("clenched fist of sadness began to open"). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery layer reweights his perspective. Slight deduction for predictable trajectory once the letter appears.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the puddle reflections revealing hidden history, leading to the lagoon discovery and archive retrieval—each beat deepening the dominant stake of memory versus erasure. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael commits to becoming "a seed" who will "make them see," with visible cost in carrying the immense weight of truth against collective amnesia. Minor orientation wobble in the opening (late contact's relevance unclear) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the prophecy fractures into "meaningless ambient noise" with visible cost shown through Elara's "deep fatigue" and the bittersweet victory. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through musical layering and the prism atrium's formation, culminating in the "perfect tone" that reweights the grotto's silence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Aisling becomes the Arbor's translator, with the cost being her fundamental transformation of being. The accumulative pattern—from sorting seeds to building monuments to achieving communion—builds coherently toward this reconfiguration. The "emerges transformed always" line makes the irreversibility explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the clock's circular movement reweights Lira's entire worldview with clear cost—abandoning her "anchor" of certainty. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from "coincidence became pattern" to the final understanding of "timing" over time. Orientation is clear and the transformation lands with felt cost in "beneath the ashes of her old rigidity."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change: Leo transforms from lost to found, while Elara's understanding of courage shifts from "absence of fear" to "choice made after feeling fear." The kintsugi metaphor effectively frames both the broken event and its golden repair. Cost is visible in Leo's terror and lost voice, Elara's days of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Kael's laughter transforms his pain and he dissolves "finally whole, finally healed" - the cost is his dissolution/release. The accumulative lens holds as dissonance gives way to pure sound. The crocodile tooth focusing intention creates a persistent constraint that shapes the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as trauma memories, sensory details, and the mathematics quest build toward a Conceptual Repricing where mercy becomes "a dynamic potential to be enacted." Cost is legible in the "permanent dissonance" and the energy required to choose kindness, though the final beat could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain: quest for fragment → decode painting → discover hidden documents → understand role. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara accepts her translator role with visible cost (the weight of responsibility). The lens holding "sees what was, and what is, simultaneously" sets up the temporal revelation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage: Leo's ceiling obsession → discovery of mainspring → vision of girl's heroism → choice to engage. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Leo breaks his rule of non-engagement, with visible cost in his "rough voice" and the weight of carrying her story forward. The orientation anchors (abandoned circus, elevator technician, ghost-seeing) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands powerfully as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rupture transforms sterile perfection into "perfect, living chaos" with clear cost (the unique frost pattern's destruction). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as density increases toward the climactic press-pull. Who/where/when anchors establish early and the piece teaches its conceptual rules through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's pyrrhic victory—winning his academic dispute while recognizing his complete isolation. The accumulative lens holds as density increases from physical description through philosophical revelation to emotional cost. However, the transition from storm to resolution feels slightly rushed, and the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Elian transforms the faint melody into world-changing resonance, reclaiming the stolen light with clear cost (his physical deterioration from Silas's dishonesty). The causal chain from inherited burden → sensing alignment → confrontation → creative solution holds firmly. Orientation anchors established early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas becomes "part of the question" with clear cost (releasing the compass forever, abandoning his collecting practice). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through descent, visions, and submersion. Orientation anchors established early. Slight deduction for abstract language at closure ("wordless, resonant kinship") that dilutes the otherwise visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from GPS failure through arch discovery to sculptural solution, with clear closure showing Elara accepting her guardian role (blank slide as future responsibility). The "timewoven alliance" concept integrates well with plot mechanics. Cost is visible - she's now bound to this duty. Minor orientation wobble with the beings' nature, but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reinterprets her grandmother's absence as gravitational love rather than abandonment, with emotional cost visible in her shift from sadness to gratitude. The accumulative structure coheres through the cathedral revelation that reweights prior material. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (amber pavilion's function unclear initially) and some causality softness in how the cathedral visit transforms into cosmic understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (lagoon's phosphorescent response) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes living archive for state murder—cost is legible in "solemn heart ascending." The diary cipher revelation through supernatural dialogue earns its place, though the convenience of Kenneth's consciousness surviving strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the town's revival through remembered context rather than literal resurrection. The cost is legible in the transformation from "deserted alchemist" to "deserted no more," with the bottle's revelation as catalyst rather than container providing the decisive reweighting. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Charged Poise closure with Elara frozen between destroying the prophecy or preserving it, cost clearly visible in violating her sacred oath versus unleashing potential doom. The accumulative build from archiving to prophecy to moral crisis lands with weight. Slight deduction as the prophecy's actual threat remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from seed preserver to active regenerator, with clear cost in sacrificing personal escape for universal renewal. The phoenix egg hatching catalyzes genuine change, and the ending image of "shower of apple blossoms under a sky of newborn green" pays off the accumulative build. Slight density excess in middle passages prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: atmospheric observation → bell connection idea → waiting through conflicting data → choosing resonance over alarm. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost - Elara risks catastrophe by not pulling the switch, trusting her interpretation. The storm turning away validates her choice, creating earned closure where listening triumphs over noise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the AI's transformation ("Ah") creating a new shared witness state with visible cost (Orion's trembling, aching). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from cleaning to tracing to final communion, though the AI's conversion happens too quickly for full causality.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through ghost interactions building to the stained glass box discovery as Resonant Reconfiguration. The final image of Silas and the woman-ghost sharing "companionable silence" with "their mutual understanding a perfect, unspoken sentence" crystallizes the covenant's meaning with felt cost of eternal witness. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through Leo's daily ritual, the garage sale preparations, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's understanding transforms his isolation into connection. The cost is felt in the shift from casting messages into chaos to receiving genuine recognition. The piece teaches its pattern early through the texture metaphor and pays it off when connection becomes "the smooth, cool comfort" echoing the fragment's physical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the broken kite becomes "an artifact, a sculpture of resilience." The cost is present - the child's loss transformed rather than erased - though the closure leans heavily on conceptual assertion ("The loss was not negated; it was made sacred") rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear closure - the lithicores' response and orchard transformation constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (Elara's life). The copper-wire bridge creates genuine causality, and the posthumous validation confirms the change's permanence. The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reconceptualizes her inquiry from skepticism to studying "the quantifiable effects of grace," with visible cost in her "fissured" rigid skepticism. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through path, amber, convergence. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "chemistry of homecoming" motivation that takes time to ground.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dead reef to blooming jetty to seed germination, with the final image of "first green threads" constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the battlefield's meaning. Cost is legible in "speaking the poison out of the ground" and the patience required for this "small, patient task." The persistent constraint of working with dead languages and natural cycles shapes both tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive lens with clear closure—Silas transforms distance into connection through scent-trail discovery, with visible cost in the dangerous journey ahead. The riddle-to-revelation sequence builds logically. The ending crystallizes as Charged Poise with legible stakes and reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris shifts from passive mourner to active explorer, with visible cost (his isolation becomes his instrument). The accumulative structure builds density through repeated imagery (silence, light, compass) that reweights at closure when isolation transforms into unique capability.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from climb to chess piece swap to sky restoration, with the trade representing a Decisive Change that costs Kaelen his prized possession. The closure lands with visible transformation (sky healing) and personal cost (the fox trinket), though the worldbuilding around why the chess pieces control the sky feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara shifts from counting the lost to "adding a piece" with clear cost - risking her observer role to save a life. The pawn-less chessboard transforms from memorial to active board, and the "luminous absence now holding the warmth of a life possibly spared" lands the conceptual repricing with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from victim to reader of reality's "brutal, beautiful architecture." The feather's texture causally guides her to the stone, which provides "grammar to read" her visions. Cost is explicit: she must endure nightly brutal truths, now reframed as "the sound of the world's heart."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when Kael places the labyrinth and time resumes. The cost is legible in "The weight in his chest, a constant companion for a decade, was gone" - emotional release through accepting his mistake. The tapestry-as-map revelation drives meaningful escalation toward the keystone discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the painted interpretations building to collective reweighting. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community shifts from singular to multiple truths, with cost visible in "exhausting, painful, necessary work."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with the charm discovery serving as the pivotal revelation that recontextualizes the entire repair. The closure lands with visible transformation (statue animation) and cost (incorporating the weapon into the wound), though the final awakening strains credibility slightly within the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's decision to leave the shell and "face the light of the world outside" forecloses his old pattern with clear cost—the decades lost. The causal chain from cracked mirror to cave discovery to shell recovery holds cleanly. The "temporary eternity" concept lands as both realized truth and price paid, though the final paragraph slightly over-explicates the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Elias witnesses failure → creates essence → sends warning → fleet responds. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias proving "whispers travel farther than shouts," though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The orientation anchors (lighthouse, pre-dawn, Elias) arrive promptly. Lens reads as Causal with the because/therefore linkage from intention to result.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the charged final image of Elara waiting in darkness, having transformed the station into a "tomb" but achieving "profound peace." The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts her fate while preserving humanity's essence, with clear cost (her life). The orientation anchors (orbital station, dying systems, Elara alone) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara chooses the harder path of building resilience rather than stolen solace, with cost visible in accepting temporary suffering for authentic growth. The causal lens holds through discovery → understanding → rejection → redefined use, though the Chinese characters "属于自己的" break immersion without translation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the Edelweiss transforms from mystery to lighthouse, reweighting Emil's death from despair to devotion with clear emotional cost ("his mind failing, stealing the music from him note by note"). The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward revelation. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay with the woman's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal chain from father's promise through intuitive discovery to self-recognition, with clear cost (years of isolation paid for this moment). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - "The decision was not about choosing a path, but about recognizing she had always been on one" - though the physical stakes could heighten.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Isolde's transformed understanding reweights her crown and kingdom with visible cost (the arduous solitary climb, abandoning court). The accumulative pattern (dream → warning → grotto → communion) coheres beautifully. The "shared exhale" between earth and sky crystallizes the transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the star transforms from "captured thing into a symbiotic one" with visible cost (weeks of failed work) and conceptual shift. The accumulative lens holds as spiral logic accumulates to reweight Lyra's entire approach. Orientation anchors (Ember Nexus, twilight, alchemist) establish quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara's perspective shift from trying to "distill chaos" to accepting it as "the point." The accumulative structure coheres through temporal layering, and the cost is felt in her "weary awe" and acceptance of her own mortality. Minor orientation wobble in the dream transition slightly dulls mid-section clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara finds "the ordinary miracle was not in the scent, but in the presence," with visible cost in her professional identity transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and water clock rhythms build toward this reweighting of her loss.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly - the scar transforms from wound to "masterful rune," with visible cost in the crystalline transformation of her flesh. The accumulative structure builds through layered imagery (steam column, held breath, crystallization) toward this earned change. Slight deduction for the overly neat resolution of childhood superstition becoming "mature technique."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Finch dissolves into the archive with visible cost (the orchard's destruction paralleling forgiveness). The accumulative lens holds consistently through metaphorical layering and sensory density. Orientation anchors established within first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure where the Witness realizes he witnesses not history's end but its "integration into the everlasting now," reweighting the entire premise. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~120 words, and the spiral pattern accumulates toward the final unification with visible cost (individual crystal records vanishing into singular luminescence).

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where clocks measuring "process" and "inevitable decay" reweights the entire premise. The accumulative lens holds throughout with density increases toward the ending. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - the threat of irreversible drift rather than actualized damage.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Elara shifts from defensive to adaptive security architecture, with visible cost in accepting vulnerability. The causal chain from intrusion → realization → coding new system holds well. Deduction for the somewhat rushed revelation that the intruder was "her own earlier, discarded work" which feels slightly convenient despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding reweights her father's addiction as calculated grace, with visible emotional cost in her "profound, complicated understanding."

Slight weakness in the middle transitions between clue discoveries, but closure lands powerfully with "I stacked the deck for her."

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final call creates "a symphony of fresh starts composed from discords," with visible emotional cost throughout. The accumulative structure builds coherently through three connected calls. Slight deduction for the abstract "tools to build itself a beginning" rather than a more concrete final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the preserved memory transforms from archival artifact to living reunion, with clear emotional cost ("The context changed once more, the past flooding into the present").

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (her own blood, accepting chaos as signal). Clear causal chain from wrong seeds → stranded → failed analyses → pattern recognition → breakthrough. The "editing history" insight transforms her approach with earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's shift from mapping silence to conducting it creates a before/after with visible cost (abandoning her observer role, returning to anonymity). The yacht's disruption provides causal pressure that forces her stance crystallization, and the final image of her resuming her camera work reweights her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara witnesses then re-hides the seed, accepting keeper role. Cost is legible in the erasure sequence ("careful, almost reverential hand") and return to ghost status. The closure lands with earned stasis as she chooses protection over possession.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through drumming patterns until reality warps, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where connection is achieved but immediately lost. The cost is visceral—gaining then losing physical touch with Kael—and the final "quiet rhythm in her pulse" shows permanent change. Who/where/when anchored early (Serenity Center, Sound Wave Garden, Subject Seven).

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the Port Master's realization validates Elara's theory without words, with visible cost in her unsanctioned risk. The accumulative structure builds coherently through sensory navigation. Deduction for the antique key subplot which introduces but doesn't fully resolve its symbolic weight, creating slight structural looseness.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from nightly ritual through crisis to resonant reconfiguration where darkness embraces the stars. The closure lands with conceptual cost—darkness accepting its need for light companions. The pattern teaches itself through repetition then breaks meaningfully when simple reflection fails.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the town's synchronized display transforms individual fear into collective courage. Cost is legible in "quiet courage" replacing fear and the risk of defying the Director's edict. The "forest of second thoughts" metaphor pays off meaningfully. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the specific nature of the ban.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas achieves Earned Stasis by severing ties to Aethelburgh, with cost visible in "the final tether to his old life strain" and his conscious detachment. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from scrimshaw to whale call to island manifestation, though the Great Pacification worldbuilding feels slightly ornamental to the core transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the lavender bloom's snap triggering a decisive shift from destructive whittling to protective creation of the floral bird. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the bird on the windowsill crystallizes Elias's transformed relationship to grief with clear emotional cost. The "remade hush" frames and pays off perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara dissolves the boundary between artist and art, creating visible light-poems before accepting impermanence. The cost is legible: abandoning traditional poetry for ephemeral fusion. Orientation anchors (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, post-ban return) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure builds through plant symbolism, the barter negotiation, and sensory transformation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra gains not color but "essence" perception, with clear cost (her original vision traded to Elara). The closure lands with "her world, once gray, was now infinitely, imperfectly, profound." Slight deduction for the overly neat thematic resolution in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers connection exists "in the resonant space between" sounds through her vulnerable participation. The cost is her surrender of control, made visible when she becomes the pilgrim rather than conductor. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through sonic layering, though the final paragraph slightly over-explicates the thematic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens coheres as Elara moves from grief through discovery to reframing, with the telescope vision providing resonant reconfiguration that reweights her craft's meaning. Cost is legible in "dark, fertile soil" and "raw materials of sorrow," though the journey section with origami coordinates feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens builds through rain imagery, measurement motifs, and the progression from digital collapse to tangible repair, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where fixing the leak becomes "the first step in rebuilding a world." The closure lands with felt cost—Mr. Gable's former boastful energy replaced by genuine collaboration—though the thematic articulation ("We're being forced to measure things we'd forgotten about") slightly dulls the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking as the central mechanic, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara chooses imperfect humanity over dissolution. The cost is palpable—she carries "the terrible, wonderful truth" and weeps. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (historian, archive entrance, lost civilization).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: dream acquisition → discovery of anomaly → investigation revealing entity → infection → sacrificial containment. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aris crystallizes her stance against the entity, with visible cost in her "painful metamorphose." The drive lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages narrowing her options to this single path.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias achieves Earned Stasis by choosing to remain gentle despite betrayal, with visible cost in his "shattered trust" and necessary shedding of naivete. The chameleon's color change and workshop restoration crystallize this reconfiguration, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than philosophically articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Conceptual Repricing: the realization that scars document healing rather than wounding, and that her miracle was "displaced" but her healing remains "hers alone, earned and honest." The cost is both felt (physical pain, shaking) and conceptual (loss of expected miracle), landing firmly on-page with the careful unwrapping as decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where projecting the film releases stored love "like a vast, beating heart." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through sensory layers. Cost is visible in the projectionist's archived emotion and Elara's ceremonial act. Orientation anchored clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - the world transforms from monochrome to color through Elara's exhausting journey and precise nocturlabe alignment. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the climactic color cascade. Orientation anchors effectively (Elara/archivist/sterile city), and the "necessary surrender" creates Earned Stasis with felt exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the fractured lullaby becoming "whole" reweights the archive's purpose from mere preservation to active healing. The accumulative lens holds as texture builds toward the charming sequence. Deduction for somewhat abstract cost ("immense empathy") and the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the world-state.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where giving the gear transforms Silas from "stray" to belonging, with clear cost (losing his last artifact). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this transformation. Slight deduction for the abstract "frontier of your mind" not fully integrating with the mechanical forest logic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the star stamp—a physical mark proving courage was always present, now awakened. The accumulative structure coheres well through the ferry crossing as transformative vigil. Cost is felt in what's left behind ("all that was left behind") and the irreversible marking. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo's pantomimed chord becomes an act of defiance, with clear cost (abandoning safety). The accumulative structure builds effectively through bolt→handprint→realization→action, though the conceptual leap from handprint to understanding the fortress's history strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the rune discovery building to decisive confrontation. Closure lands with visible cost—the pretender's psychic tether severed, his false history unmasked. The "truth is already written" setup pays off when the rune deflects the attack, creating clear before/after reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery of atlas page → research → journey → finding living reef → reconfiguration of worldview. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's stance shifts from pure witness to loss to acknowledging persistence, with emotional cost visible in her two-rhythm tapping. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure when Elara becomes the focal point and activates the ancient power. The silver light connecting "a thousand points in the darkening sky" creates visible change with implied cost ("terrifying action"). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words, though the cost could be more explicitly felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara releases the embryo-seed, transforming from preservation to evolution with visible cost (the "immense burden" becomes enabling action). The accumulative structure builds through discovery layers—amber, kite, plant translation—though the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("some rules are meant to be unsealed") slightly dilutes the image-based power.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Earned Stasis) - Elara's choice to continue tending plants despite recurring trauma. Cost is visible in the freeze/thaw cycle and the photograph's transformation from clutched anchor to exhibited history. Orientation anchored early (arboretum, keeper, cliff).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where reality fragments intensify until Elara's thread-weaving creates a descent path, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "luminescent ache" transforms from burden to tool. The cost is felt through what she must release ("let that thread go") and the darkness she must embrace, with clear before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where reality's "layers of ink" reweight the entire premise with clear conceptual cost - the drone's unmaking demonstrates the price of truth. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build through spilled ink, moonlight, and perception shifts. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from discovery through broadcast to aftermath, with clear Decisive Change when Elara transmits the letter. Cost is visible in "She had lit a fuse on a monument of lies" and the transformation of the archive from "tomb" to "witness." The closure lands with felt consequence as she accepts her new role. Minor weakness: the speed of her security bypass strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Elara chooses to carry the truth rather than destroy it, with explicit cost ("She would carry this weight now"). The causal chain from discovery to decision is tight, and the closure reframes her father's legacy from protection to active engagement. Orientation anchors establish setting and situation within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Nereus absorbs the echo "passing through him and settling deep in his soul" with clear emotional cost ("anchored by understood grief"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through sonic layers to this transformation. The lens holds throughout with excellent causality in the spike-thorn resonance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure through Decisive Change—Viola actively writes the corrective column, foreclosing the lie's path with visible cost to potential profit. The proof by contradiction method drives the middle section effectively, and the final image of her "in sync" with the stars resonates with earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from guilt-as-dissonance through spectral haunting to final harmonizing. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost - the ghost is "laid to rest" not erased, transformed into "a new fixed star." The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the emergent hush transforms from oppressive silence to meaningful harmony. The tile fragment discovery and its activation create the decisive pattern break that reweights all prior unease. Cost is visible in Elara's acceptance of impermanence through scattering her mandala.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure where renaming history from "Folly" to "First Offering" reweights the entire premise with clear conceptual cost. The retrocognitive vision provides causal linkage between past mercy and present mission. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara weaves death into her artistic tapestry, transforming the stuck note into an encore. The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and musical metaphors. Cost is legible in the acceptance of death and the spirit's final intertwining with the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from shock to memory loss to pill to recovery to artistic creation. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the skeptic becoming believer) and tangible outcome (the light painting). Minor deduction for the pill's effects resolving too smoothly - the "fractally precise clarity" arrives without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through sensory mapping to the fossil's emotional conduit moment, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen understands his role as medium rather than speaker. The floating sequence crystallizes this shift with visible transformation. Cost is conceptual but legible: he must wait, must be the bridge, accepting a fundamentally altered understanding of his work.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the obsidian button transforms the hourglass's nature, expanding prophecy into spectrum. The accumulative lens holds as button-cataloging builds to this reconfiguration. Cost is conceptually clear (abandoning singular destiny) though emotionally understated. The piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost - Elias risks imprisonment to authenticate the warning. The causal chain from observation to interpretation to decision is tight. "Where unused courage waits was not a place, but a choice" crystallizes the transformation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis form) as Silas keeps his promise by waiting until "rain gutters stop ticking," adding his notation to the map, then departing with "the essence of the place now held securely within him." The accumulative structure coheres through sensory details building toward this quiet fulfillment, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final act of pressing "her own intention into the clay," creating vessels that continue the beekeeper's protective legacy. The accumulative lens holds throughout, with each act of kindness building toward the revelation that resistance requires active maintenance, and the cost is legible in her commitment to perpetuate this "sharp gentleness."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the fire escape transforms from "cage of escape" to "bridge of delicate light" with visible cost (the rose's death enabling new blooming). The accumulative structure coheres as each reflected beam builds toward communal connection. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Elara achieves independence not through erasure but reconciliation, with the sundial transformation serving as the decisive moment. The accumulative structure coheres as memories layer into the stone circle's revelation, and the cost is legible in her acceptance of permanent solitude transformed from loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from disconnection through discovery to public transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as private secrets become communal art, with clear cost (dissolving the letters' individual meanings). The spiral motif effectively bridges natural and human creation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract motivation articulation early on.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive where discovery of subsonic manipulation leads directly to counter-broadcast decision, creating clear before/after with crowds "waking from a shared dream." Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("exhausted," "battered") and the signal dissolving. The "infinite game" framing charges the ending with ongoing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain: organ note triggers spatial mutiny → Elara uses compass as anchor → key manifests. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (her confrontation with fear) and the metaphorical resonance of "mapping the territory she feared most" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Ellis's methodical process gradually deepening through empathy until the portrait breathes with consciousness, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where his blindness to faces transforms into true sight. The cost is legible in his permanent alteration ("awakened something long dormant") and the portrait's effect on the detective, though the closure's explanation dialogue ("I didn't draw what they saw. I drew who she was") edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where pulling the nail transforms both ancestor's exile and Elara's purpose, with visible cost ("the weight of the copper in her pocket"). The causal chain from coded journals to nail to map is clear, though the magical realism element of the appearing map slightly strains believability without more grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from vanishing hitchhiker through glass-as-map to fiddler encounter achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (Elias's "never" identity burned away). The glass serving as both portrait and map strains coincidence slightly. Cost is legible in the transformation from passive observer to "participant" and "the man who had answered when the universe whispered."

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal lens with clear closure: Ash's decisive break from the circular path carries visible cost (abandoning his only inheritance and connection to his father). The backstory about the failed business partnership effectively tilts Ash's present stance and enables his final choice. Minor deduction for slight predictability in the revelation structure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from failed attempts → dream revelation → understanding → action. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms personal discovery into communal purpose, with the cost being her shift from academic achievement to shared burden. The dream sequence effectively bridges the problem-solution gap through dramatized revelation rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal chain from failed spell through seed discovery to moral choice, culminating in Earned Stasis where Elara's refusal to plant the seed forecloses the path of recovering lost things with visible cost ("The lost things were still lost"). The frozen confession concept effectively reframes the lake from cursed to jailer, though the opening could anchor spatial orientation more clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as symbolic density increases toward the climactic blood-binding that transforms Lyra from "held" to "hold it all together"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in the cutting. The eclipse-covenant-scar pattern coheres causally, though the intersection's nature could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of roots/bones/meaning building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara integrates emptiness into "melancholic wisdom." Cost is visible when she offers her "brightest, most impossible dream" and accepts the void. Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Elara and Silas, quest for soul-patch) established early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear causal chain from failure → defensive work → discovery → revelation about purpose, with visible emotional cost in confronting Leo's death. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) works well - Silas moves from "insulating emotionally with facts" to understanding he's "preserving their stories." The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from grief through failed attempts to revelation about surrender, culminating in the seed's release triggering both the carrier wave and new growth. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (letting go of control). The revelation about ancient understanding of transition physics effectively reweights prior failures.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian's transformation from fearful vessel to expanded consciousness carries felt cost through his tears and shuddering.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as the old woman receives the pearl and decades of separation dissolve in shared light. The causal chain from bunker inspection to pearl discovery to delivery is clean. The "wall between their two hearts... vanished completely" provides clear before/after with emotional cost paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Elara moves from graffiti wisdom to found map to human encounter, each layer reweighting her understanding of forgiveness as process rather than destination. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration—she recognizes she must embody rather than chronicle her path to forgiveness, with visible cost in "mended and patched, but whole." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through cipher discovery, library entry, and seal-breaking to reach a resonant reconfiguration where Elara becomes guardian rather than seeker. The father's revelation lands with conceptual cost—she realizes the quest was internal all along. Minor density issues in middle exposition slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the synchronized wilting reweights the empire's power through collective grief. The "perforated destiny" discovery propels causal action (Elara's choice to propagate the mourning), and cost is visible in the dissolution of both violin and flowers. Who/where/when anchored early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the emerald chip's transformation crystallizes the captured essence with visible cost (Elara's breath/heart stopping). The accumulative lens holds consistently through ritual buildup to the final "keeper of last lights" image that reweights the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking closure when Elara performs the ritual with collective memory rather than individual action, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("forgave herself for the hurts she had caused"). The hairpin-as-key mechanism drives meaningful escalation through visions that reweight her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from client arrival to Elara's choice to offer truth instead of comfort. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she inverts her professional role, with visible cost in the client's crumbling face. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with the third ripple as organizing principle. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen becomes light—"You have not vanished. You have finally appeared"—with clear cost (loss of solid form). The trance-within-reality layering and grotto revelation work well, though the transition mechanics could be cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong causal elements, building from sonic disruption through bird-pattern revelation to physical intervention. The closure—Zephyr understanding that navigation requires embracing movement—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (abandoning centuries of passive tradition). The trapped pulse resolution restores equilibrium while fundamentally repricing Zephyr's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's understanding transforms from seeing magic as force/efficiency to recognizing it as presence and lingering. The cost is visible (leaving her position, physical exhaustion from saving the keystone), and the hybrid lens holds, though the final paragraph's "she had found wonder" edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the glowing algae, sky lanterns, and luminous vow building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas's quest resolves through the "soft, green-gold glow of a promise kept." Orientation anchors (pier, lamplighter, festival night) establish early, and the closure lands with conceptual cost—the realization that what he sought was not in sound but in preserved love.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear DC closure - Alaric chooses to feed his own frequency into the cosmos rather than select a pre-existing option. The backwards prophecy creates a genuine reversal that recontextualizes his task. Cost is visible in the blood from the obsidian and the sacrifice of self. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the exact nature of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when ephemeral sounds crystallize into physical gems, each naming a fear - a concrete transformation with clear cost (her sacrifice echoes throughout). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallization. Orientation anchors early (ancient observatory, reaper, dusk) and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Elian's exhaustion and the world's restoration. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the dripping water discovery that reweights his approach. Minor deduction for slightly rushed closure mechanics after the bell's restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Elias arranges the photographs as a shrine rather than destroying them, with visible cost in forcing the bulldozer crews to "choose to see the stories before they buried them." The accumulative structure coheres through the photograph trail leading to self-recognition, though the final paragraph slightly over-explicates the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure where Elara achieves synthesis of logic/intuition through enacted understanding, with visible cost in risking the crystal. The causal chain from quest→threat→insight→action→transformation holds firmly. Who/where/when anchored early ("auburn-haired alchemist...before the kaleidoscopic waterfall").

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with the buckle's revelation as a legitimate payoff to established setup ("The key is always to have a backup plan"). The closure achieves Charged Poise—Lena descending with crystallized purpose and reconfigured understanding of her mission. Cost is visible in abandoning her post and the physical/emotional risk of descent. Minor gap: the exact nature of Elias's true mission remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Kaelen channels paired opposites to vivify the brain, each attempt building density toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where he accepts "every opposing force."

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from mysterious seed through research to protective planting achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (legal quagmire, halted development). The "storm-born silence" bookend creates resonant reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the nocturnal haven's exact nature.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the wife's laugh transforms the tunnel from echo chamber of grief to bridge between them.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from static listening to active creation through density increase and pattern reversal. The closure—witnessing stellar birth through amplified silence—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cosmic-scale change. Cost is legible in years of failure leading to this moment, though personal stakes could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure: Felix's broadcast merges timelines with visible cost ("permanent transient tone to Felix's reality"). The hourglass transformation from empty relic to temporal anchor provides clear before/after. Orientation anchors early ("evening rush," "ferry deckhand").

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arthur experiences profound reconnection with visible emotional cost (weeping). The accumulative structure coheres well through the weaving metaphor. Slight opacity in how "memories alter" functions as timeframe rather than clear temporal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation from teaching underwater navigation to opening humanity's path to the stars, with the chain link as catalyst. The causal chain from discovery to response is clear, and the cost—humanity's shattered sense of place—is established early. The Visitor's final response validates her work while pulling "humanity's horizons with it," though the emotional cost could be more visceral in the closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the mother's trapped love message finally received and peace granted, with felt cost in the "one long, sustained, and peaceful tone" dissolving. The pattern accumulates through tracking pulses, recognizing the lullaby rhythm, then speaking back to complete the circuit. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara, atrium at twilight, contact tracer role).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal progression from tidal window → facility exploration → codex discovery → phase transition revelation → return with testimony. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (bearing witness replaces data retrieval) with felt cost in the phase transition experience, though the emotional price of carrying this knowledge could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis - Elara continues the painful reconstruction despite Julian's suffering, with visible cost in both their pain and the blood from the porcelain shard. The accumulative lens holds as heartbeat counting, memory fragments, and the ink patterns build toward this moment. Deduction for slightly abstract framing of "fetch wisdom from failure" and modest orientation delay regarding the exact nature of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from translator to instrument, with visible cost in her eternal binding to the canyon's lamentation. The accumulative structure builds through texture-to-sound experiments toward the breakthrough and curse activation. The piece teaches its sensory translation pattern early and pays it off when "The canyon did not simply echo; it translated."

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear accumulative/textural structure builds from static confessions through gravitational play to the final unified note, with the arrowhead's transformation marking decisive change. The closure lands with visible cost—the Changed's bitterness transforms to laughter as Aris sacrifices her tool of division. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: music triggers statues → flight to Warden → desperate act with shell → transformation. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (the destroyed clockwork heart, Kael's soul-scream) as the city transforms from sterile function to "verdant energy." Minor orientation wobble with "twin suns" appearing late without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael realizes the healing isn't a place but the work itself—this reweights all prior actions with clear emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as each delivery/connection builds toward this crystallization. The drone encounter provides meaningful tightening that tests his commitment. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph, though it's earned by prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carousel's song validates Elara's silent craft. The halo fragment discovery triggers the transformation causally. Cost is present—she gives her silence to receive song—though the mechanics of this exchange could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well—sensory fragments in the scarf lead to ritualistic walking, which triggers perceptual shift and discovery. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: "she had reawakened her own" suggests personal transformation through decades of searching. The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words and maintains the textural lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from passive recorder to active creator, with clear cost in the "trembling hands" and the permanent change to the archipelago's "gentle hum." The accumulative structure builds through layered descriptions of incompleteness to the decisive act of painting light. Slight deduction for the "cipher" metaphor remaining somewhat abstract despite its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's understanding shifts from burden to "legacy of resilience," with the tear as embodied cost. The pattern of locks/keys/liberation accumulates coherently. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract - we see emotional release but the specific price of this new understanding isn't fully dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from lost memory to recovery, with the celestial map discovery providing meaningful escalation. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the fairy ring as guardian rather than thief - with clear emotional cost in decades of misunderstanding. The revelation reweights the entire premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elias gains freedom through the apprentice discovering the key to his conditional exile. The reversal (exile as lock requiring successor) lands with visible cost. Minor orientation delay with the nature of the exile initially unclear, but this serves the eventual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure building to Resonant Reconfiguration where the seed becomes vessel for preserved wonder. The cost is felt through Elara's soul-drain and the "fleeting moment" of restored brilliance. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Deduction for somewhat abstract rendering of the "weaving between worlds" mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the unraveling transforms both spirit and restorer, with visible cost in Kael's guilt and brother's death. The accumulative structure builds effectively through sensory revelation. The piece teaches its pattern early (unraveling nets reveals memories) and pays it off. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost description in final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when shadow discrepancy reveals the hidden chamber. The discovery and descent create Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("weight of centuries pressing in"). Orientation anchored early with character, location, and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong conceptual repricing closure where the shattered snow globe demonstrates "letting go" as a physical state change rather than emotional failure. The cost is felt through Elara's "sophisticated melancholy" settling as "diffusion" - a reconfiguration with clear before/after. The accumulative lens holds consistently through metaphorical layering (water, air, vacuum, suspension).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (ghost's graffiti language) that builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms trapped code into liberating song. The closure lands with visible cost—the ghost's energy is "spent" and Elara has given voice to an age-old silence, fundamentally changing both entities. The bolt plate as physical key provides the persistent constraint that shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through the diary revelation reweighting Elara's understanding of service and memory. The closure lands with emotional cost ("grateful joy now a quiet warmth") and transforms her descent. Orientation anchors established early (elevator, spire, penthouse delivery). Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the broken tether creates irreversible ascent, forcing Elara from observer to participant in the atmospheric archive. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts becoming "a new note in the eternal, dusty starlight song" with clear cost—her earthly life forfeit. The lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building through discoveries: coin's true pattern, wax impression as key, hidden compartment, celestial pigment. Closure lands powerfully as Elara transforms the wall into "a window into a forever she had saved," with clear cost (building's imminent destruction). The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from hopscotch observation through symbol translation to celestial discovery, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where Elara's status fundamentally shifts. The cost—"sociable isolation had been the necessary price"—is explicitly stated and the final image of charting "a new cosmos from a dusty game" reweights all prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the orrery's repair, which literally and metaphorically restores time's rhythm with visible cost (the consumed moonlight). The causal chain from prophecy to solution is elegant, with "To start the whole, you must first uncap the part" providing the crucial turn. The closure transforms both the library and Elian's understanding, making the before/after legible through concrete physical changes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught chalk messages building to the nebula revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is felt in Aelia's draining effort and the settlers' transformed understanding, making the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through Elara's permission-granting that transforms the clock's purpose. The puppet head functions as both catalyst and message, creating clear causality. Cost is felt in "every keeper who had ever loved the world enough to let it go." Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, Elara's role) establish cleanly within opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure—the nut-as-key revelation transforms the labyrinth from prison to navigable space, with visible cost in the frost threat. The blueprint discovery drives the resolution logically. Minor deduction for the convenient timing of the woman's accidental discovery, though it serves the causal chain well.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost as Aris shifts from building "a better cage" to designing "a better process," with the chrysalis transforming from "empty vessel" to "full of possibility." The accumulative structure coheres as natural observations (ravine patterns, foam dynamics) reweight his understanding of filtration and connection, though the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond intellectual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara realizes she's not finding where stories begin but serving as their "diligent custodian." The cost is legible in the spent moonlight bottle and the man's carved-out pain. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds—glass orchard, bottled light, surgical incision—toward this final reweighting of her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Kaelen's curse leads him to seek the mythical larder, his method reveals the entrance, and his contact with the oyster forces him to subsume centuries of remorse. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen transforms toxic memories into "just a memory, integrated and quiet," with the cost visible in his exhaustion and being "hollowed out." The "unspoken dream" frame gains meaning as absolution becomes "spoken, and answered."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the isolated silos begin "singing along" through restored connection, with the clock's rhythm as "heart-like" beat for the city. The accumulative lens holds as sound builds from silence through mechanical restoration to harmonious communication. Cost appears in the years of isolation ("seasons ago") and Elara's understanding that "her work had only just begun." Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around the transformation mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from archeologist to "restorer," integrating the broken mirror's fracture "into a new whole." The cost is palpable - she absorbs another's despair and makes it her foundation. The accumulative lens holds as memories layer toward this transformation, though the final beat could be slightly more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain leads to Decisive Change with visible cost - Elara becomes the first sentinel by planting the seed in her mind. The gravity inversion mechanism enables discovery causally, and the closure lands with the weight of responsibility ("her watch was just beginning"). Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the grotto's recursive nature.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence breaks. The closure lands with palpable cost—a generation of silence—and the "humble beginning" acknowledges the gap between one note and the symphony needed. The forensic empathy discovery provides the crucial pivot that enables the final success.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Decisive Change - the cartographer returns to awareness through Kael's intervention, with cost visible in "terrible, beautiful truth." Causal lens holds throughout. Deduction for the somewhat abstract final line about "healing the board" diluting the concrete resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sonic discovery leading to Conceptual Repricing where Ariadne reweights her entire worldview from silence-worship to embracing "magnificent, noisy silence." The cost is legible in abandoning her lifelong mission's narrow focus ("no longer an assault but a symphony"). Opening the locked clasp through frequency tuning creates causal linkage to the grandfather's sonic catalog discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's final acceptance of the corpse flower's scent as "part of the profound stillness" reweights her entire quest with visible cost (overwhelming her sensitive senses). The doodled wisdom "Patience is the root" sets up the ironic reversal when her impatience triggers the preemptive bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal linkage throughout with clear closure—Kaelen's transformation into guardian carries visible cost (responsibility for protecting the fragile cycle). The gravity inversion creates meaningful pressure that reveals the hidden chamber, and the arrow tip's discovery chains logically to understanding. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Charged Poise closure where Vale stands against the "quiet storm," her transmission creating a crystallized moment of intervention with clear stakes. The causal chain from silence→wind patterns→patch→convergence mechanism builds effectively. Minor deduction for the conceptual leap to "temporal pulling" which strains believability without more grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the protagonist achieves his goal through unexpected means, transforming from bell ringer to light conductor. The "sculpted hush" to auroral symphony progression builds coherently. Cost is legible in the "drained but complete" state and the transformation of materials (amber cleared, ice dissolved). Slight deduction for the convenient cosmic alignment mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's transformation from keeper to harvester lands with clear cost (her unraveling, her confrontation with failure's ghosts). The accumulative structure builds coherently through sensory details toward the final insight. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "thunder-echo range" concept, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each empathic transaction builds toward Elara's self-confrontation, with the halo fragment constraining her method throughout. The closure—Elara weeping for "the beautiful, hollow proof" of her emptiness—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable emotional cost. Minor orientation wobble with "the Vanishing" feels slightly underanchored.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the aurora bleeding color triggering the delivery, the pendant's sympathetic vibration with cosmic energy, and the crystalline transformation creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas becomes "keeper of the road between memory and myth" with clear cost—Kael's permanent absence made tangible. The closure lands with visible transformation of both landscape and protagonist, though the vision sequence briefly risks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's fundamental assumption about absorbed emotion shatters and reconstitutes. The cost is legible in "her assumption—that absorbed emotion would feel human—shattered into a thousand luminous pieces." The piece teaches its pattern of communion/listening early and pays it off when she communes with frost instead of the prism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's destruction of the loom releases stored energy to heal the blighted tree, transforming her from eternal weaver to freed witness. The cost is visceral—"her life's work" unwoven—and the closure reweights the opening's "keeper" role. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (amber's warmth, puzzle's negative space) build toward the final healing image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's bartered transformation enables the silo's rebuilding, with the cost (her memories of fear/meekness) made explicit in the cavern scene. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of woman and silo "glowing with soft, azure defiance," though the journey-return structure leans slightly formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure as Elara accepts the weight of completing Aris's work—a Decisive Change with visible cost. The redirect mechanism creates elegant causality where Aris's sacrifice directly enables Elara's discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution of all mysteries through one vision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elias's cairn-building transforms from defensive gesture to connective act, with visible cost in facing supernatural threat. The letters discovery midpoint effectively reweights the haunting from pure menace to threat against human connection. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the ghostly presence's retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Silas's adjustment causing the light loop, which steers the storm, which prevents the coup. The closure—his realization of prophetic power and decision to "shape the next dawn"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in his "fearful awe." The orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, storm approaching) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Hira receives "not just an organ, but an entire way of seeing" with clear emotional cost - the loss of his former quiet self. The accumulative structure coheres through color/light imagery building to the illuminated wing's revelation. Slight dock for the orientation taking until "Tuesday" to fully anchor when.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully when Elara discovers the labyrinth is "not a prison for sorrow, but as a sanctuary for it," fundamentally reweighting the premise with clear cost—the trees' "silent, vegetal sacrifice." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details and measurements build toward this revelation, though the orientation could anchor more firmly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing from solitary ritual to collective song-weaving, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community creates "a single woven dawn." The mica window's transformation from showing silent past to reflecting their present creation provides clear before/after with felt cost in their "bound release." Who/where/when anchored early through "mirror world," "alchemical orchard greenhouse," establishing the piece's otherworldly logic.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively from invitation-as-gravitational-force through library revelation to the earned paradox of "staying while leaving" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The piece teaches its reflective mode early and pays it off when Elara reframes her error as "magnificent structure" surrounding a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when Kael uncloaks the world, revealing the sacred hidden in apparent decay—a perfect reversal that reweights everything prior. The cost is legible in "tenuous absolution" requiring continued belief and active tending. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of decay/renewal build to this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through frequency sampling to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library's true purpose reweights everything prior. The closure lands with clear cost—the library's frozen stasis as a "long sleep" waiting for resurrection—and Elara's role transforms from preserver to awakener.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the recorder captures not external betrayal but Elara's internal fracture—"the silent, internal fracture she had just felt." Cost is unmistakable in the sigh that "escaped her own lips" and the transformation from burden to release, with the dawn dissolving the market as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's decision to join carries visible cost (abandoning his observer role) and the compass ring's true purpose as finding "purpose" not "place" reweights the entire narrative. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final crystallization, with clear orientation anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a Causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkages from commissioned portraits to creative awakening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost ("sorrow for his wasted years") that reweights the opening's grayscale world into prismatic color. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the old woman's motivation remains opaque, creating a minor causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from map discovery through descent to water source revelation, with the zinc fragment's "Candor Above All" message crystallizing the thematic closure. The cost is legible - Elara must share truth "no matter the personal cost" in a city where dishonesty physically harms her, creating a Charged Poise ending where options and stakes are reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the restored harmony spreads through the valley with palpable effect ("the color of wonder, bright and whole, blushed across the valley"). The accumulative structure builds coherently from discord detection through repair to restoration, with clear cost in the iceberg's ongoing decay that Elara can only temporarily address.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught compression of chaos into manageable form, paying off in the rose transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the two-toned rose representing integrated fear with visible cost (the plant's cosmic black transformation). The controlled burn escape through the bio-mechanism provides clear before/after with the static resolving into "managed resonance."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through neighborhood stories that converge on Leo's revelation. The closure—Leo finding peace through Elara's witnessing—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible emotional cost ("spent and trembling"). However, the connection between the morning's hit-and-run and Leo's arrival strains coincidence, and the six-decade delay requires significant suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's reversal of her loneliness-cipher liberates both herself and the AI, with clear cost (dismantling her defensive encryption). The accumulative lens holds as dance-language accumulates meaning through repetition and transformation. Minor orientation delay but paid off through the archive's centrality.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara recovers one memory but leaves others, accepting incomplete restoration. The accumulative pattern (gravity pockets → coffee grounds → crystal chamber → memory flood) coheres well, though the connection between whale death and memory release feels slightly arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—the prophecy hushed to "harmless, forgotten dream" with clear cost paid through Aeliana's exhaustive effort. The paper wing's subtle movements effectively track progress. Orientation anchors established within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (meteor shower, revelation) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara stands alone with the seal, transformed into the building's new scribe with clear cost (Mr. Valerius's dissolution, inherited vigil). The "agreed upon lies" dissolving under meteor light creates decisive conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonance structures building to a Decisive Change where Elara integrates her suppressed memory, paying visible emotional cost. The shell discovery → Archive activation → memory recovery → acceptance follows clean causality. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final transformation that could use one more beat of embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Kaelin's individual act of treason transforms into sanctioned justice when Varos reveals the Queen's complicity and provides the seal. The cost is visible—her brother dying, her risk of execution—and the final image of stalactites marking "punctuation" in "forgiving twilight" creates resonant reconfiguration. The twist feels earned through Varos's shared grief (his son in the regiment). Slight deduction for the convenience of Varos tracking her without earlier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the shell's whisper triggering progressive discovery that culminates in Elara joining the eternal chorus—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (her individual voice merging permanently). The journey from canyon to Nexus follows causal linkage while pattern accumulation drives the closure. Slight deduction for the convenience of finding the Nexus entrance exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from establishing Elara's unique ability through the dream-fragment methodology to the insurance fraud revelation. The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth exposed "to the universe itself" carries conceptual cost in the purser's eternal guilt. The piece teaches its pattern early (dream harvesting, psychic archaeology) and pays it off, though the final beat could strengthen its felt cost beyond the abstract "terrible fact."

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lin's understanding moment: "The audacity was not in the whistle, but in the belief that his small, somber action mattered." The cost is felt through the "fleetingness" and "brief lives spent in brilliant, silent toil." Accumulative structure coheres as moon-path imagery and hidden patterns build toward this earned recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from investigation to discovery to decision, with the stillpoint revelation serving as the decisive change that reconfigures Elara's worldview. The cost is visible in her choice to protect rather than expose, sacrificing her identity as a debunker. The closure lands with "protecting the truth so the lies, for once, could continue to comfort" showing clear before/after with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Cassian amplifies the prophet's frequency over the Aerie's, with immediate cost (console sparking, darkness) and lasting transformation (storm breaking, new day shaped). The causal chain from discovery through temptation to decisive action holds firmly, with the "perfect, complete stanza of weather and time" paying off the Codex Tempestas setup.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from collecting sounds to finding the music box to Miss Elara's singing, with clear cost in "gleaned redemption for letting it be forgotten." The closure achieves resonant reconfiguration as "the past and the present harmonized," though the final image could carry more specific weight.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kaelen achieves sonic absolution, transforming destructive ice movement into "quiet understanding." Cost is visible in the risk taken and the effort required. The causal chain from problem through attempted solution to successful harmonization holds well, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the awakening transforms both sanctuary and protagonist - "The revolution was not an attack; it was an awakening." The cost is legible in Elara's transformation from impatient revolutionary to guardian. Slight weakness in the middle section's pacing, but the accumulative structure holds and the lens remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Elara's professional mission "irrevocably altered" - though the emotional price could be more visceral. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering and historical parallels.

    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively—shadows don't go anywhere but are "inverted, consumed and renewed" through reality's self-mending process. The accumulative structure coheres as fragments build toward revelation. Cost appears as acceptance of a broken-but-healing world rather than finding a fixable location. Minor orientation wobble with "floating isle" geography not fully anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from changeling discovery through tooth-as-compass to realm crossing and negotiation. The Charged Poise ending crystallizes options with the tooth as "bridge, not weapon."

Closure lands on the page via the choice to keep the roof open, with the price (exposure, relinquished control) embedded in the final image. The cause‑chain is modest but coherent for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: frost → ledger strip → frequency code → relay → unsent message → decision to broadcast. Closure lands as a decisive change in goal and tactic, with cost implied by renewed exposure and the physical toll already shown. Orientation is crisp early, and the single-POV thread holds. The ending stops at vow rather than execution, but the reweighted options are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate: a post-Collapse silence, Elara in the Winterglass Conservatory, a single workbench and devices. The causal sequence is clean: memory → resonator mapping → failure (not music) → reconception (“make the silence sing”) → application → transformation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the persistent constraint (no sound) shaping tactics. The cost is subtle—accepting a new definition of music—yet legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: package → dive → discovery → task → lens installed → release. Orientation is prompt and steady, with a single scene drive and coherent stakes. Closure lands on the page (the light activates; the grandfather dissolves) with a felt conceptual cost (transforming distress into welcome and ceding the role). Pressure is gentle but sufficient for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: bell summons runs → mysterious caches raise stakes → Kael investigates → Maever’s reveal → decision to reframe the story. Closure lands as a charged poise: he lifts the bell to declare a truth that will reconfigure communal hope with cost. The cost—risking shattering the benefactor myth to ground hope internally—is legible in the final image. Minor softness remains since the declaration is prepared rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: memory → setup → breathing/mantra → projection reveals the spot → retrieval → reconfiguration of purpose. Orientation is immediate and clean; the closure lands on the page with a legible before/after (pilgrim to conduit). Cost is present as a burden of purpose and emotional overwhelm, though resistance is minimal. The pattern holds consistently through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of the halo fragment → retrocognitive vision → geometric reframing → recalculation at the fracture → mother returns. Orientation is solid early; the two‑shard structure (present/vision) is controlled. Closure lands on the page with cost (photos disintegrate; artifact relinquished). The only slight softness is the low resistance in the final execution beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Strong causal chain: arrow pattern → piano sequence → mural opens → sentry confrontation → chain‑kick disruption → emergency seal. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses his own freedom to secure the vault, with a visible price (“sealing the vault for a hundred years”). Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the lens holds cleanly through the final image of the arrow on the bench. No soft resets or off‑stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each step (absences → descent → contact → imprint) deepens pressure toward a charged realization. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing—she acquires the sound with its human context, shifting her stance from obsession to sorrowed acceptance. Cost is legible in the self‑imprint of trauma. Orientation is clean and stakes cohere in one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: cues → infiltration → extraction → complication (constable) → reinterpretation → leap → charged poise ending. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she exits with the “moment” and assumes the cost of being its unworthy guardian. Orientation is crisp; scope stays within a single scene window. The price is felt more aesthetically than materially, keeping it shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thaw’s soundscape and the ice‑sheet fall densify pressure toward renunciation. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and closure lands on‑page with a visible cost as she leaves the bookmark. The final image reweights the control room and her craft without mechanical tying‑off. Minor exposition about the collective borders on summary but doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: betrayal → clue on cast → nautical decoding → dive → retrieval, with one transition (library to sea) and no dropped set‑ups. Closure lands as a decisive act and resonant reconfiguration; cost is embodied at surfacing. Orientation is firm by ~120 words (who/where/why). The causal lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of hush builds toward a charged cadence shift when the gold leaf lands, reconfiguring the premise (silence as map). Closure reads as a conceptual repricing with cost: “for the first time, the Oracle had nothing left to listen for,” foreclosing her prior stance. Orientation is clean, and the coincidence of the flake functions as patterned culmination rather than convenience. The before/after is legible and earned within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp and the lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative end: iterative attempts lead to a conceptual repricing at closure. The violin’s loops escalate options toward the decisive confluence, and the final realization reshapes the premise on the page. Cost is legible in the loss of the violin and the foreclosing of timeline plurality. A minor continuity slip (704/734) doesn’t break causality but grazes confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: delivery → lens → discrepancy → misfiled logbook → lens decodes → incineration. Closure lands decisively with visible cost (destroying the record), and the choice reconfigures her role. Orientation is early and stable; scope fits the length with one tight transition. Minor convenience (perfect lens reveal, handy incinerator) is plausible within the established world and doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with a clean situational lens: daily ritual → intrusion → stance crystallization. The closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she keeps the garden and her ritual, but the cost—ongoing deception under hostile scrutiny—is felt. Orientation is immediate and causality coherent (meter reading prompts confrontation). The cost is understated yet visible in the ongoing maintenance and secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent causal thread from demonstration to boundary‑thinning to the decisive shut‑down. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Vesh’s worldview tilts and a path to deeper risk is foreclosed. Cost is present but soft (danger implied rather than exacted), yet it’s enough for a quiet piece. The accumulative build (past → future → adjacent now) is disciplined and holds its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → decoding → performance → building’s shudder → charged quiet. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hall “sighs” and an earned stasis replaces tension, with conceptual cost (a letting‑go of the hall’s old life). Orientation is strong early; causal logic from water‑revealed score to structural resonance is coherent within the piece’s rules. The decisive act is on the page and its price—release, not spectacle—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because he witnesses an impossible avalanche, he interrogates marginal data, discovers the harmonic spike, and reconfigures his world’s rules; the “oracle” paradigm is repriced with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—resolve hardened by the brass weight. The cost—“terrifying freedom,” the system’s failure, and his isolation in truth—reads directly in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: hum → valve → apparitions → radio bleed → interpretation → decisive turn → revealed backstory → felt aftermath. Orientation is crisp from the opening line and the single-scene window holds. Closure is on-page via the wheel’s click and the reconfiguration of who carries the truth’s weight. Minor convenience in her interpretive leap doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: hum → descent → refuge → rupture → origami instruction → filter-healing → restored silence. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and an Earned Stasis feel (“hers to maintain”). Orientation is crisp early; scope stays within a single throughline. The cost is modest yet legible; a slightly sharper on‑page price would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate and the scene unfolds cleanly to a charged closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the eclipse deepens the pattern until the hair’s note reconfigures the dominant stake from grief to awe. The cost is subtle but present in Leo’s tear and in the relinquishment of protective silence. The closure sits on the page without after-the-fact explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative lens holds. The investigation through diaries coherently deepens toward a closure beat where he reframes his role. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (“I had not been preserving life; I had been performing an autopsy”). The because/therefore chain is soft but sufficient for a textural build.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: fortune → binocular surveillance → microdot projection → Lena perceives and chooses the boat. Closure lands as a charged poise with the row toward danger/possibility and Eli’s relinquishment. Cost is implied (night crossing, risk, Eli’s melancholy) but not deeply dramatized. Orientation is solid and the lens remains causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal chain is tight: layered “why” leads to recoil, to syllogistic net, to revealed assumption, to the pigment’s decisive application. Orientation is clean from the opening; the ticking possession clock narrows options. Closure is an on-page Decisive Change with visible cost (pigment used; stability restored). A hair more resistance or setback before the final press might have deepened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hum → chord → inversion → dawn prism → quiet returns. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and setup (dawn’s approach, the Spire’s geometry, the shell) pays off causally. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she cannot go back, but reprices her ache with a charged final object state (warm nautilus). Cost is explicit on the page in the collapse and foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens cleanly: runes accelerate → memories intensify → runes settle → final refusal to generate path → the fall. Closure lands on the page with cost as he relinquishes the very power that defined him. Orientation is crisp from the outset (Kael on the glowing viaduct after rain), and there are no causality cheats. The persistent constraint (abyss/viaduct) shapes tactics through to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: teaching → discovery of reverse vibration → recital where silence is remade. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she risks a public test and pays in vulnerability before winning a sacred silence. Orientation is clean early, and set ups pay off (phonograph, backward grooves). Causal pressure is gentle but enough for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: being followed intensifies alertness; the pigeon’s message triggers analysis; the deduction reframes prior “storms”; she redirects the report to a news hub. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she commits to exposure and accepts risk, concretized by releasing the bird and then waiting. A minor convenience is the swift permit cross‑reference, but it doesn’t undercut coherence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: UV unveiling of the fern → scent grief → Elara’s counter‑key (vial) → visible memory tableau → conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate (greenhouse, roles, tool), and closure lands with cost (vulnerability; relinquished protective ignorance). One scene, single dominant stake, and a decisive on‑page shift from confusion to understanding. Slight convenience in the vial’s efficacy prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Situational with accumulative lyric pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses immediate enlightenment to protect the world, revaluing “texture of time” as choice and interval. The cost is explicit (forgoing his life’s pursuit) and on the page via the rope circle. Orientation is crisp and single-scene; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: harbor → greenhouse → ritual → sustained tone → reconfiguration of the hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: silence is revealed as full, and her role shifts from player to interlocutor, with grief’s cost felt. Orientation is clean and causality is steady without arbitrary leaps. Quiet but structurally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: lab failure → grotto immersion → carrier choice → charged final act. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she reframes the goal to a half truth and pays with acknowledged loneliness. Orientation is clean early, and the causality of the carrier insight pays off precisely. The turn is quiet but decisive and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: symphony ends → Elias decides → library delivery → locket revelation → revaluation of Maeve’s contribution → nascent friendship. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his act reframes value and acknowledges costless labor, though the on‑page price is mostly vulnerability, not a sharper consequence. Orientation is crisp within the first 120 words, and scope stays within one scene. The misaddressed envelope is a tidy coincidence but functions as premise rather than a late fix.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural; the sigils’ pattern builds toward a conceptual repricing of the arbor and community memory. Orientation is firm early; causality is coherent: discovery → shared inquiry → map → missing final mark → reveal → dedication. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a visible conceptual cost (reframing “defacement,” surrendering the private offering for communal inscription). Some middle turns are summarized, slightly damping on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: sensed flaw → targeted journey → pendant opens Spire → Warden’s rule‑reveal → choice to sacrifice. The piece holds a Hybrid drive ending in Accumulative/Charged Poise, with a legible before/after configured at the core. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph, and the cost is on the page (“uncage infinity” at the core), even if the ignition is not enacted. Exposition is functional and doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds to a conceptual repricing where the target shifts from measuring emotion to mapping its absence. Orientation is crisp early; the glass eyes catalyze the turn, and the offering seals the closure with cost (relinquishing her prior approach). The chain reads motivated rather than arbitrary despite the “on a whim” trigger. The ending image is earned and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → search → tape fragment with sense memory → hidden panel → box → decision to reveal before power returns. The drive lens reads Causal with a clear closing act (placing the cache on the desk) that reconfigures stakes. Closure lands as a resonant decision with conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp early; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the storm’s arrival, systems shutoff, and extended observation build to a conceptual repricing of “model” into “map of possibilities.” Closure lands with cost—the renunciation of control, blank tablet, and redesign commitment. Orientation is solid from the outset. The causal thread is modest but coherent for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal through‑line is crisp: noticing the rain’s convergences → following them → discovering the geometric pool → choosing an exchange → fresh water flows. Orientation is clear early, and the lens is held through the ending. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a visible cost (brooch + bread) and reconfigured options for the village. The magical logic isn’t over‑explained yet remains coherent for the unit.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: arrival → cave heart → dissonant attempt → shadow surge → light tactic → siphon → collapse. Single-scene coherence and legible rules (sound/light/shadow) support a Decisive Change, with the pearl’s custody and cave’s music restored. The cost is present but light (risk and humility rather than a marked loss). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens reads as Hybrid with a causal spine: return → display → speech → on‑the‑spot discovery → accusation → communal response. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus a social turn, with the final touch‑ritual reweighting the object and the city’s story. Cost is implied (accusing old rulers publicly), but the scene softens risk via immediate acceptance, trimming impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single‑scene frame holds.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern intensifies from city mist to vault to charged object to door to library, and the closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: she trades mapped order for a lifetime of mysteries. Orientation is crisp early (midnight city, mist, POV). The cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the decisive act (punching the door and crossing) creates a clear before/after. A bit more on‑page friction at the threshold would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whale songs → tile activation → richer memories → translation → reflective broadcast. Orientation is strong from the opening and the final broadcast produces a resonant reconfiguration (he believes; the song deepens in recognition). The because/therefore chain is coherent without mechanical plotting. The felt cost at closure is modest rather than sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal—storm overloads lattice; therefore magnetic conduits form; therefore she wields the cursed shard; therefore the wall unravels; therefore she escapes. Closure is a Decisive Change with a tangible cost (the shard’s destruction) and a conceptual reweighting (freedom toward unknown fallout). Orientation is crisp from the first lines. The resolution is slightly smooth—no failed beat or hard tradeoff beyond the shard—but causality holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive holds cleanly: reaching for the ink pot therefore triggers the reveal, which therefore reprices her father’s life and her role at the funeral. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the ending reconfigures the premise of honesty/dishonesty and forecloses a simpler anger. Orientation is clear within the first lines, and the final choice (keeping the passport and shifting her stance) lands on the page. No teleports or soft resets; the tightening is singular and decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: a ritual attention gathers density until dawn steadies the hum and forecloses access. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—lamp becomes “just a lamp,” notepad closes, and she descends with a reweighted universe. Stakes and cost are legible in the narrowing window and the relinquishment of altered perception. Structure is coherent, single‑scene progression without causal slips.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fragments accrue to a pattern, culminating in the office warning and a reweighted return to the maze. Orientation is clean early (port yard, erased man, tides) and the label anchors the causal chain. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses confrontation in favor of archivist duty, with a felt conceptual cost. The cost is more implied than dramatized physically, but the warning line and final image make it legible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: observatory → compass points → cello/shell method → reception of the Signal → decision to retell. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis—she reframes the universe from question to story and commits her remaining time to bearing it forward. Cost is present but light; opposition is largely internal and the method works on the first try. Orientation is clear early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with causal backbone: Elias’s warning and the returned chip → graffiti execution → community uptake via the net‑mender → decision to carry the idea into official channels. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes resistance as guidance and commits to a tactic with stakes. Orientation and timeline are clear from the outset; the “survey tomorrow” adds pressure. The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, when), and the scene holds a single, coherent through‑line. Under a Situational/accumulative lens, pressure coheres via the countdown, Earthrise, and the approaching machines. Closure lands on the page as a charged poise: the last photo taken, then the hum of intrusion, with a visible conceptual cost. Causality is clean; no setup is dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: mangled drone → unorthodox test in the fountain → conceptual reframe → programming patch → launch to ship. Orientation is crisp early and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the drone’s successful departure) linked to her reframing. The cost is modest but present through time pressure and the choice to pivot from hardware to interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with clean causal spine: condensation pattern → trek → discovery → conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate (outpost, frozen lake, falcon at a fixed hour), and the closure occurs on the page with cost—her quest ends as epitaph, not triumph. No teleports or soft resets; the returning images are kept and paid off. The price is legible in her choice to end the search and accept the world’s “postscript.”

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the accumulative/textural drive is maintained through rhythmic work toward a cadence shift in the square. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the town stabilizes as “a perfect, eternal memory,” and the archway firms. The cost is conceptual—revival as memory, not life—under a live clock of failing spells. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: call → temple → vial discovery → guardian → oxygen clock → decisive opening of the vial. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a resonant reconfiguration (from threat to recognition) and a conceptual cost (becoming steward). The oxygen alarm provides concrete pressure at the peak. The “civilization as library” insight arrives quickly but remains motivated by tactile contact with the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: he steals the lattice, the Warden manifests, he reinterprets the object as filter, speaks truths, and the threat resolves with a felt price. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his stance changes and the environment’s pressure lifts. Orientation is strong and single‑scene focus is tight. The “before they find the bodies” clock is underused tactically but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal throughline is clean: bead discovery → vision reframes the true debt → decisive gift → orchard’s renewal and the ghost’s release. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (loss and peace), and the before/after is unmistakable. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; the single scene holds. The constraints and payoffs all feel prepared rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual repetition coheres into a clear RR/CR: the labyrinth “awakens” and reweights the world’s rules, sanctifying the village. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern (sewing → sleepwalking → deepening) holds through closure. Cost is present but soft (exhaustion, renunciation of the council’s way) rather than sharply dramatized. The final image delivers a satisfying reconfiguration without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a conceptual repricing: from restoring a broken device to recognizing nature’s completion. Orientation is clean and the causal drift (arrival → excavation → discovery → contemplation → reframe) holds. Closure lands on the page with a modest cost (abandoning the “find/repair” fix for a living alternative) and a charged final image. Stakes are quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds to a resonant reconfiguration: the mailed letter and smudged chalk mark a charged poise—work complete, meaning dispatched, evidence erased. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when). Closure carries conceptual cost (self‑effacement, erasure), though the turn is quiet rather than decisively causal. The throughline coheres in one scene with a clean cadence shift at the drone’s departure and the crowd’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent causal chain: coup pressure → Kaelen’s plea → Elara’s strategic alternative → Kaelen adopts a plan. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he leaves with a specific tactic and a reconfigured understanding of power, while Elara recommits to her hidden stance. Cost is implied (risk, secrecy), not fully paid on the page, tempering the impact. Lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure with causal instruction) and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative build resolves in a resonant reconfiguration: the window’s message reframes the premise with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the shard, spirits, and pane cohere causally within this lyric frame. The closure lands on the page and the cost—accepting non‑action as action—is legible. The drive lens holds consistently as Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the surgery frame accrues meaning through coral/maze echoes and pays off in a quiet on‑page transformation. Orientation is clean from the first line; the two‑shard structure (OR → memory → awakening) holds. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (experimental risk; wound remains). Causality is tidy: Kaito’s cast → coral pattern → surgical plan → altered outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: discovery → research → execution → activation accrues pressure and meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fragment completes the light‑grove and reweights her goal—joy via collaboration with the past—against the cost of ephemerality. Orientation is clean from the outset. The causal turn via the knowledge network is tidy and believable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: garden test → mural revelation → dome culmination, each deepening the rule of reflected sound. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with the pure note reweighting her vocation and the site’s meaning. The cost is conceptual—abandoning “finished” restoration for open-ended discovery—felt but understated. Orientation is crisp early, and set-ups (nickel, acoustics) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal spine: warning (kale/squash/rosemary) → decision to concentrate meaning in the gourd → agents’ approach → conceptual detonation → aftermath. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the language is shattered/warped, meters die, agents lose perception. Cost is legible in the sacrifice of the prior code architecture, even as it reconfigures into an “untaxable form.” Orientation is firm early and remains stable through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aching soil → shell silence → wind-lullaby → translation by carving → planetary hum softens. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (centuries of wakefulness releasing into sleep, burden shared). Orientation is clean early and the one-scene arc is coherent. The decisive act—carving the final symbol—links discovery to consequence without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: crack → search → vial → inhalation → light mend. Orientation is crisp and the closure occurs on the page with a decisive change and a modest felt cost (spent echo, lingering regret). The path is somewhat linear once the legend is recalled, but the widening crack provides a real clock. The ending’s charged poise—hope edged by loss—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: stuck translation → hunch with the cracked inkwell → sigil revealed → conceptual key (“to witness”) → completion → silent reconciliation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in knowledge plus a Charged Poise in the relationship. The price—risk of permanent silence—is present but lightly dramatized on the page. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain under a Situational→Causal hybrid lens: ultimatum → hidden signal → reinterpreted stakes → engineered third path → institutional acquiescence. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (adoption of the bypass) and a charged final image (gears turning, tear). Cost is mostly emotional and reputational, not materially priced, which tempers impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation and drive are clear early; the accumulative pattern (ritual → accident → discovery → release) coheres. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: she forecloses secrecy to send the song, paying with risk and the possible loss of her last bird. The meteorite’s tip is a mild coincidence but grows organically from her practice. Cost is legible in the send‑off and in the reweighted meteorite image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens (causal moves inside an accumulative frame): logbook → grain-decoding → insight about temporal thresholds → deliberate crossing into the storm-memory. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules are repriced (“map of consequence”), and she exits with altered agency. The cost is legible in the passage through terror (wind, screaming metal, seeing her father trapped in origin) and in accepting the burden of pursuit. Orientation is clear early and fuels the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues via failure, redirect of method, and pattern recognition toward a conceptual repricing of “landscape.” Closure arrives with the beacon and the reweighted premise (the deep as the true firmament), with an implied endurance cost (“until sunrise,” isolation). Orientation is clear early and the single-scene structure is clean. The cost could be sharpened, but the cadence shift and reconfiguration are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain—persistent gaps → walk → seed → conjecture → experiment on crater glass → discovery → commitment to document—reads clean and motivated. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the problem shifts from “missing paths” to “buried by collective inattention,” with the cost of irreversibility acknowledged. The seed’s arrival is coincidental and edges toward solution-by-chance, but Finn’s agency in testing and reframing preserves earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: tide → siphon → lever → launch → catch → renunciation. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he achieves the goal and chooses secrecy at a cost. The pressure arc is modest but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through ritual action toward the moonstone “key.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: exile becomes vantage, self becomes constellation, with embodied cost in the tattooing pain and risk. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the progression is coherent. The only restraint is the absence of a sharper external consequence at the end, though not required for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation lands cleanly within the first paragraph; the single‑scene arc is coherent. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ripple observation deepens pressure and reweights the goal. Closure is on‑page: he reframes the task and completes the window as the sun breaks. Cost is conceptual more than punitive, but the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: present‑tense contemplation thickens via discovery (tooth, hair) to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the recurring object structures the beat sequence. The closing choice—to not hide and to teach—lands on the page with conceptual cost. A quiet but decisive before/after is legible without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—the world reweights when the resilience/community interplay yields an “equation” and she sends the painted balloons upward as a prayer. Orientation is clean early (single POV in the grotto), pattern is taught and paid off. Cost is mostly conceptual (choosing a lyric-mathematical faith) rather than viscerally felt, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of diary/negative → wall‑scream → conceptual turn to testimony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when her cartography becomes public witness; the cost (emotional burden) is legible. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard transition (manor → community) is coherent. No causality breaks; escalation is soft but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on the page: the mirage becomes briefly real, projected into the mirror, then dissolves after three peals, with the cost legible (“offered a piece of her own life force,” “drained but serene”). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the bells impose a live constraint that coherently shapes tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/situational lens, the scene coheres: ritual focus → steady guiding → acknowledged terms → handshake → final notation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost (her internal burden and the painstaking labor) is made legible on the page. Orientation is clean early, and the single continuous scene satisfies scope. The quiet resolution avoids gimmickry and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene, situational lens holds: the approaching storm coherently tightens pressure until the on‑page decisive act (dropping the egg). Orientation is clear early; causality ties the break in his control to the internal turn. Closure lands with cost via the click of fossil on stone and the reweighted self‑concept. A minor world causal ellipsis (how he manufactured the drought) stays peripheral to the scene’s drive.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, single POV, and a clean accumulative/textural build from approach → touch → method reveal → sequential untangling → final decisive pull. Closure lands on the page: the sanctuary dissolves, the hum ceases, and she pays through pain and forfeiture of the cage’s safety. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words. The drive lens remains consistent through to a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: argument aftermath → reappraisal → tool choice shift → public performance. Closure lands on the page with cost as she performs in Kael’s terrain, having destroyed her old pages to build the puppet. Single POV, two-shard structure (dome to bar) is coherent and tight. The drive lens reads Causal, held through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pattern of reverent construction breaks (hawk’s flurry), is reconfigured (moth wing knotted), and culminates in a charged poise as the swarm circles and moves on. Closure lands with cost: the last monarchs are gone, his signals weather, and he accepts Earned Stasis (not rebuilding) that forecloses a path. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and set‑ups pay off (crimson thread, arch, wing). Slightly modest external pressure keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: failed archive → fragile card/wax won’t hold → rope insight → aurora-focused solution → bronze closure. The rope’s function is foreshadowed as a “ceremonial” object and then reinterpreted, avoiding a pure deus ex. Closure lands on-page with a decisive material result and a reweighted internal state. The price is mostly risk and near-loss rather than a consequential trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a Situational-to-Causal hybrid lens, the storm’s approach coherently tightens pressure, leading to the wafer seal break and the core reveal. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “observe, not predict,” with an on‑page cost (breaking the last testament seal, relinquishing misbelief). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/when) and stays clean. The storm constraint and dream shard linkages hold causally through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative lens: repeated rational attempts escalate, then a pattern‑break renunciation reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on‑page with the magic square’s sustained light and the entity’s appearance, and the cost—abandoning her defining method—is legible. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. The causal chain is compact and coherent without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal drive is clean: broken pin → need for song → Lyra’s method → Kael’s release → melody returns to stabilize reality. Anchors are clear early, and the guardian’s arrival tightens the scene. Closure lands on-page with a felt price and a transformed state. Minor convenience in the guardian’s instant reappearance is supported by the text’s rule and doesn’t undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure holds; who/where/when is anchored early and carries to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands: the city becomes a “permanent possibility,” reweighting the premise with the cost of relinquishing capture for coexistence. Setups (sextant, old text) pay off causally under the textural lens. The cost is conceptual rather than overtly painful, but present and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: breach → Lyra’s pressure → ribbon discovery → reframed vow → public offering → delay of demolition. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (wreckers delayed) with a tangible tactic. The cost is present (abandoning her defensive stasis), though the Councillor’s quick reversal reads easy. Orientation and lens hold cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: discovery → rule breach → vision → redefinition of inheritance → decisive new aim. Closure lands with a decisive change and conceptual repricing as she pockets the shell and heads for the telescope. The cost (rule violation, career risk) is implied more than dramatized on the page, softening the punch. Single POV and two‑shard structure are coherent and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal spine: Elara arrives → predator pressure → research of absences → breath‑as‑silence → threshold opens → sanctuary. Orientation is crisp and the lens reads Hybrid with a Causal dominant at closure. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (sanctuary entered; predator excluded), though the felt price is more conceptual than visceral. The “gap” logic is consistently set up and paid off without conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean early (ship, fog, motive), and the structure tightens with the journal discovery leading to a redefining realization that reweights prior images. Closure lands on-page: she reconceives the ship as the garden and accepts custodianship, with the final act (reading aloud) sealing the shift. Minor neatness in the journal-as-key keeps it just shy of elite inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence—discovery of seal → anomalous door → diagnosis of system failure → procedural fix—links cleanly and culminates in an on‑page Decisive Change with the door gone and the document restored. Orientation is crisp, single POV, one contiguous window. The cost at closure is muted, more conceptual than felt, keeping this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure concentrates on teaching the stone to release silence, and the “bloom of hush” serves as on‑page RR. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the causal throughline within the lyric mode is intact (ice‑crack method → persuasion of energy → diffusion → hush). Cost is present (exhaustion, altered vocation) though modest; closure is nonetheless legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: seed → retrocognitive vision → undercroft discovery → coordinates → weeks of star-path work → alignment → initial silence → hum → beam. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (light rekindled) and a Conceptual Repricing (the message was survival, not distress). Cost is present as time, isolation, and risk of null result, if somewhat light. Lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres as environment condenses (fog → shell), culminating in a charged, on‑page closure. The closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she refuses the lamp, accepts entombment, and reframes identity as the act of examining rather than the archive’s future readership. Cost is legible: permanent isolation/sealing and the knowledge that no one will read the record. Orientation is clean early; pattern is taught and paid off with the final shadow “exactly enough.”

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly—the density of light/noise builds to a cadence shift when the mosaic is ignited and the crowd rises. Orientation is crisp early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress community physically rises, reweighting the premise. Cost is subtle but legible as spent materials, risk, and disciplined focus under despair.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: discovery → vision overlay → reweighted relationship → gentled conversation. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the jade cicada threads causality through. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the conflict is repriced as a molting rather than a rupture, with a tangible olive branch. The costs are emotional and conceptual rather than dramatic, but they register.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑POV, one continuous escalation: bunker → inversion → trellis → return. The closure unit lands cleanly with the charged act of planting the doll and the visible cost of surrendering her comfort object. Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance holds; causality remains intact and coherent. The hour‑limit returns to close the frame with gravity’s tug.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from disturbance to resonance to hush, with the storm glass as a closure proof. Orientation is crisp, and the causal chain (hum → arch resonance → hush) is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, though the cost is soft and mostly conceptual. The “perpetual transit” note gestures at ongoing price without fully embodying it at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: mural → coordinates → journey → defense → fruit → map → deadline, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the “stairway.” Closure lands on the page with cost (orchard dims; the ticking sunrise; role redefinition). Orientation is solid early and remains coherent through the end. The defense resolves quickly, but the ending’s reweighting and time pressure hold under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal arc is clean: arrival → recognition method → object trial → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost via the burn and Kael’s dissolution; the lens reads as hybrid with a strong accumulative cadence that tightens at the ring. Orientation is clear early (chapel, starlight, knocker) and pays off in the final image. No unkept setups or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal lens: glitch texts → hum/crystallization → recognition of a conduit → retrieval of bolt → “I volunteer” → pressure translated into diamond. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a charged final image. The bolt is set up and paid off without teleports; the cost registers in peril and bodily sting. A hairline convenience in recalling the bolt’s suitability keeps it just below the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual builds from hiss to hum to confession, culminating in a charged poise/earned stasis: he learns the first sin and accepts binding consequence. Orientation is clear early (sepia reading room, gramophone, goal). Causality is clean: crank → resonance → emergent voice → reweighted understanding. The cost is on the page in the final acceptance and the foreclosed freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reality’s pulse, the guiding flora, and the whispered command build to the decisive unsnapping and identity shedding. Closure lands on the page with cost (abandoning the knight’s shell), and the final image reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clean from the outset. The command “Choose and complete” is a touch convenient but coheres with the world’s established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres as the discovery deepens meaning rather than triggering plot reversals. Orientation is clean from the start; the letter and button catalyze a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias’s “penance” becomes “excavation,” with the cost of continuing to work inside grief. Closure lands via the final image (button on letter) that reweights everything before it. No causal seams or resets undermine the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: lateness → puddle‑map discovery → lagoon → booth → archive → mission. Single POV and two‑shard flow hold; orientation is firm early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/commitment rather than a decisive reversal; the cost is conceptual (risk, burden) more than dramatized. The drive lens reads Causal with a quiet, purpose‑driven ending that holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterning of sound vs. negative space tightens until the prism pulse and single note resolve the pressure. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration—prophecy fractured, hush restored—with a felt cost (exhaustion, daily recurrence implied). Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality gaps. The persistent constraint (recurring morning duty) charges the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative build lands a decisive change and conceptual repricing (the Arbor becomes a library; she becomes its translator). Because/therefore links are soft but coherent: discovery → prod → vision → shrines → flare → transformation. Orientation is clean; the lens holds. The cost of transformation is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive is tight: compass → greenhouse → passage → waterfall → clock → improvisational repair → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“timing” not “time”—with a paid price in relinquished control and physical risk. Orientation is clear from early lines; the lens holds. A hair of convenience in the magical logic keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a causal lens, every beat proceeds by motivated linkage: alchemical sympathy → luminous trail → sealed furnace → rescue → reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and clean; the on‑page opening of the rusted door gives a concrete test. Closure lands as a Decisive Change paired with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy is found and the meaning of “courage/name” is repriced with the coin. Cost is legible—days lost, fear borne, and Elara’s reckoning—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: dissonant harp → spectral confession → reframing shame → crocodile tooth focus → laughter captured → spirit integrates and dissolves. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and closure lands clearly with a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The cost is felt in Kael’s confrontation with shame and release, even if Elara’s price is minimal. The drive lens reads as causal and holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Causal—waking pain → sensor discovery → deliberate removal → algorithmic ripple → conceptual shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: mercy reframed from static formula to enacted choice, with cost signaled by pain, risk of surveillance loss, and persistent proprioceptive torment. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when, single scene), and the turn is on-page and motivated. The before/after is legible and stakes reweighted without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is clean: obtain lens → reveal hidden act in painting → locate brick → retrieve accounts → resolve to continue the work. Single POV, one continuous scene with one purposeful transition, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (accepting stewardship of the histories). The cost on the page is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible in the commitment to carry on. Orientation is strong from the opening and world rules remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: silence → observation → ghost’s cue → ceiling panel → mainspring → vision → decision to speak. Closure lands on the page with cost (breaking a protective rule) and an immediate effect (the girl’s release). Stakes are coherent and narrow. The horological vision is a single rule‑bending beat that’s internally consistent with his ghost‑seeing premise.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern break and sonic “rustling” build to the printed rupture, then reweight the system. Closure lands with cost—the flawless book is altered; the library groans and the frost’s singularity melts. Orientation is clean from the outset and all set‑ups (bottle, frost, press) pay off. The chain is tight without relying on mechanical cause‑maps.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ion storm and mirror‑covering narrow the lens to a charged revelation, leading to the poem‑method and a solitude‑tinged victory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—he “wins” but at the price of being the sole citizen of his imagined world. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when). The causal string (storm → mirrors → removal of self → optics language → poem as proof) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clean, single scene, and the causal chain holds: alignment → descent → confrontation → physical revulsion → choice to tether → release of light. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—the city’s meaning reweighted by the wave—and the cost is legible in the forfeiture of Silas’s dim‑stability and the risk to “everything we’ve built.” The accumulative/textural lens dominates at the end, coherently taught by the music‑mechanics metaphor. No teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: factory hush → descent → lagoon → psychometry → plunge → renunciation. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he risks himself and abandons the compass and his usual collecting). Beats link coherently with because/therefore logic even within the lyric mode. Cost is legible on the page at the ending image (letting the compass fall, surfacing changed).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: GPS failure → arch shelter → lantern slide revelation → reimagining → carving → restoration → renewed pact. Single scene holds together; orientation is early and stable. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (she inherits a role). The main weakness is the muted on‑page sacrifice; risk and cost are implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal progression is tight: patron’s hint → cathedral test → light reveals etching → return and recompose the mural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost (reinterpreting abandonment, relinquishing the “repair” plan). The two‑shard structure is clean, with clear anchors and one meaningful turn. The sunbeam is a coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves without her interpretive act and choice to repaint.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Hybrid lens with an accumulative dominant at the close, the causal chain is clean: cipher failure → vision → debris messaging → two‑way exchange → encryption key → vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: her vow to become the bearer of truth, with the horn calling a return to action. Cost is present as an assumed burden and the horror of state murder; it’s felt even if not materially paid yet. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) with one continuous scene and a single transition.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres from investigation → insight (“not a container, but a catalyst”) → ritual reading → reconfiguration of the town’s state. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on‑page effects (lanterns, scents, laughter), though the cost is more conceptual (accepting context over bodies) than visceral. Orientation is crisp early; structure is one continuous progression without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Situational with a clean Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate; the causal spine—flawless prep → micro ridge → mis-etched Aramaic → ominous playback—tightens options to a single, high-cost decision. The final beat crystallizes a before/after with the oath and the active prophecy on the line; the cost is legible even in refusal. No stray set-ups or soft resets undercut the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation and causality are clear: phoenix hatches → acorn appears → entropy reduction reopens the rift → planting triggers reversal. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a reweighted world-rule. The cost (foregoing escape, committing to stewardship) is present but lightly implied rather than pressed. Single-scene focus and tight throughline hold under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mounting hush, erratic needles, then the charged vibration culminate in a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure (she leaves the lever untouched). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single scene coherence is excellent. Cost is legible as an on‑page risk: choosing reverent restraint over a safer alarm. The bell’s autonomous toll reweights the premise without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats compound from discovery to ritual use to the AI’s quarantine alert, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where “tracking” becomes “witnessing.” Orientation is clean, and the closing image is a clear before/after shift in the station’s purpose. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than material, but legible. The chain from glass-discovery to AI integration holds without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from pattern (silent witnessing) to a charged object that reweights the covenant. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: placing the box where the sun ignites it, with the ongoing cost of custodianship. Orientation is clear early (recluse, oasis, ghosts) and causality is clean enough: the woman’s gaze drives discovery → interpretation → ritual placement. The cost is felt (“responsibility settle onto his shoulders”) even as the ending remains quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from ritual to experiment to recognition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act. Orientation is swift and stable; the Upheaval and silo frame are clear by the first paragraph. Closure lands in the shared understanding with the young woman, reweighting Leo’s project from measurement to connection. Cost is subtle but legible as loneliness risked and endured before the return of recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kite’s snap precipitates a single deepening of purpose that culminates in a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the kite is transformed but grounded forever, and the child’s loss is sanctified, not erased. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is simple but coherent. The ending’s charged poise is on the page, not merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patient patterning (wiring, listening) culminates in a cadence shift when the lithicores respond and the orchard reconfigures. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: she succeeds but does not live to witness the aftermath; the diary and transformed orchard bear the price. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what). Causality is coherent without needing multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres: path → statues → amber → circle → reinterpretation of the tower/path system. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the path is the message and “homecoming” equals release, with a felt cost in giving up a rigid stance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when; 72 hours after “first contact”). The final choice—turning back down the path with a new inquiry—reads as an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of silence, bird reports, and dead-language litany culminates in the audible seed-split—an on‑page closure that reweights the ground. Cost is conceptual (bearing memory, refusing expedience), present in the final charged poise. Orientation is clear early, single scene respected. Minor reservation: escalation is subtle, not transformative in options, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: Argus finds the cylinder → amplified “voice”/riddle → light-door → hidden compartment → spectral analysis → actionable trail. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing of “distance,” with a charged final image. The cost is implied (desolation, danger, leaving home) more than dramatized in-scene, tempering impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the density of quiet observation escalates until the glint-induced glimpse reweights the stake. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in stance—he abandons nostalgia mapping for charting an unseen structure—with the cost of ongoing solitude and severed past implied. Orientation is clear early (dead ship, time dilation deck, fleet severed) and the final image (charcoal scratching against silence) seals the new trajectory. Causality coheres without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear Causal lens: climb → swap → confrontation → trade → repair. Setups pay off cleanly (the lid as “key” to the true pieces), and the closure lands on-page with a visible price (relinquishing the fox). Orientation is crisp from the icy spire to the frozen library. The mechanism click into astrolabe borders on neat, but it’s prepared enough not to feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal thread is clean: listening practice → anomalous sob → decision to intervene → concrete aid → reweighted final image. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: she “adds a piece” instead of only counting losses. Cost is implicit (risk in aiding a deposed guard and a reorientation of vocation) and present on the page. Orientation is clear early and the lens holds (situational with causal beats).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the feather-method shifts her tactic and leads causally to the stone, which reconfigures the premise. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the cost remains (nightly visions), but meaning and stance change on the page. Orientation is crisp, and the chain (Alistair’s caution → seeding via texture → tactile path → stone’s quieting) holds. The mystical mechanics are leaned on but remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: anomaly → decoding → plinth → keystone insertion → time resumes. Closure lands with both a decisive change (spell breaks) and a resonant reconfiguration (self-forgiveness). Orientation is clear early, and setups (thread, labyrinth, storm) pay off. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the break in pattern (child’s echo → High Speaker freezes → communal refracting) culminates in a conceptual repricing of the ritual’s premise with legible cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; causality holds: his painting prompts inquiry, which fractures the ritual’s momentum. Closure lands: the ritual is “forgotten,” and a new communal practice is asserted on the page. Slight ease—minimal resistance from authority—keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: failed repair → pattern recognition → cog as cause → binding cause to wound → activation via narration. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the statue awakens and the world’s pressure remains but is morally reweighted. Cost is legible on the page (embedding the mentor’s charm; accepting a challenge rather than a rescue). Orientation and lens stay crisp throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: cracked mirror → drive → wrong turn → cave → shell → revaluation → decision. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive renunciation and conceptual repricing (“temporary eternity”). Cost is legible in the refusal to return to the quay and the relinquishing of the shell. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds throughout without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: heat breaks → apparatus prepared → intention infused → release → boats alter course. Orientation is early and solid; single scene holds, with one tightening at the “nothing happened” beat before the turn. Closure lands on the page via the boats’ course change plus a conceptual repricing of how warnings can travel. Cost is present but light; the piece opts for a quiet decisive change rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: hydraulic failure → midnight directive → build from scraps → beam sent → power death and earned stasis. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the first paragraphs and sustains coherence. Closure lands on the page with cost as the station goes dark and she remains alone but at peace. No false beats or unkept setups weaken the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene situational pressure coheres: rumor → orchard → discovery → temptation → calibrated refusal. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses a constrained tactic (momentary occlusion as trowel) over surrender to “a beautiful trap.” Cost is legible: she trades the fantasy of full relief for a narrow ledge of clarity tethered to another’s fear. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual descents build until a pattern break (the woman’s arrival) reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the act is recast from despair to navigation and he surrenders the flower. Cost is legible: he relinquishes guardianship of the riddle and accepts his role as witness, narrowing his path. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and set-ups (dock, flower, ritual) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: rising creek → map symbol → matrix stamp → ants → fissure → tunnel → cavern → water doorway → recognition. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (she reframes “decision” as self‑recognition) and lands on the page. Cost is soft but legible as a relinquishment of the quest for an external answer, shadowed by years of isolation and the risky descent. Structure stays within a single continuous scene with one transition and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the dream pattern → comet “final warning” → climb → communion → repriced rule. Closure arrives on the page via conceptual repricing and earned stasis, with the post‑descent governance shift proving consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single‑POV line holds. The cost is subtle (a relinquished detachment and a secret she must carry) but legible in the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: failing star → offered shell → whispered reframing → revised method → stabilization. Orientation is immediate and stable; single scene, two characters, one dominant stake. Closure is an on‑page decisive change with a conceptual repricing of “stability” as growth. The cost is subtle (relinquishing force for flow), but legible within the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure thickens (nostalgia → dissolving walls → multivalent selves → flight) and culminates in a cadence shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she reframes narrative from cage to vessel and resumes writing with a new stance. Cost is legible in the final beat (surrendering jealousy and control after seeing her own grave). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when anchored), and the scroll returns to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: the fog/screw/drip pattern intensifies until the arrival of the christening clock crystallizes a new stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she accepts a future without smell and reframes presence as craft. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds tight. The mother’s entrance is convenient but functions as coherent situational pressure, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from hush to held‑breath to flare, yielding on‑page closure as the rune completes and breath releases. Orientation is immediate (platform, tea, exam), and each beat causally builds. Cost is visible in restraint and the risk of failure; the final image reconfigures meaning (scar → rune) with a felt before/after. The throughline holds without stray detours.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost softens into the archive, the saws begin, and the lost nocturne surfaces; cost is felt via orchard loss and Elara’s admission. The motif density and cadence shift (from hush to saw-roar) coherently tighten to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the universe’s hiccup tightens cadence, the spiral assembly densifies pattern, and the dictionary question triggers a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the closure occurs on the page as the records fuse into one luminescence. The cost is conceptual more than visceral, which trims peak impact. Still, the before/after is legible and earned by prior patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is tight: anomaly → diagnostics → missing key → dangerous workaround → restored rhythm → conceptual repricing. The closure lands as a conceptual reweighting of “what clocks measure,” with a palpable risk run in the present. Cost is implied (catastrophic drift averted; sweat, danger), though not deeply felt beyond the scene’s tension. Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene focus serves the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clear within the first lines (who, where, when), and the causal chain is tight: breach → data‑shard → mycelium model → button press → coding shift. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: redefining security as permeability, capped by “she simply listened.” The cost—abandoning impermeability—is more conceptual than dramatized, but legible on the page. Lens: Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance at the end, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: lantern → token → subway scrawls → people helped → library → journal. Closure lands via conceptual repricing as her father’s philanthropy reweights his addiction, with the journal as on‑page cost and proof. Orientation is clean from the outset, and set‑ups pay off. The chain is streamlined; one more frictional beat could have added torque.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clear: successive calls build a pattern the final image reweights. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the motif of connection tightens toward dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he powers down the disc after orchestrating a “new path,” with conceptual cost anchored in his chosen exile. The cost is more thematic than dramatized, keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal chain holds: retrieve cache → extract data → learn sacrifice → son arrives → handover. Closure lands as a Charged Poise image with felt cost and a clear before/after reconfiguration (archive safekeeping → living delivery). The son’s arrival edges on convenience but it deepens rather than sidesteps cost. Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance at the end is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: rumor brings Clara → the moon rock reframes options → Elias proposes the museum → communal reconfiguration lands. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost (Elias forfeits solitude/control; Clara carries stories). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. The decisive turn is quiet rather than pressured, but coherent and on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hum → notes → silence → absorption is coherent and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (ring now inward, vocation reweighted). Orientation arrives early and remains stable, with one continuous pursuit scene. Closure carries cost via the flood of loneliness and the permanent alteration of his instrument. The because/therefore chain is gentle but intact for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal progression: stranded by wrong seeds → data futile → shift to editing history → pen/blood catalyst → conceptual reframing → system lock on gravitational signature. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost (“reconfigured her remaining power”), and the drive lens holds. Stakes are primarily epistemic, but the power expenditure and marooning make the price legible. A hair more consequence on survival logistics would nudge this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the yacht’s intrusion tightens pressure, prompting Elara’s counter‑gesture; the engine cutting creates an on‑page resonance shift and a felt price (she foregoes her solitary mapping to risk being seen). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world listens, then forgets again, and she accepts that cost. Orientation is clean from the outset. Stakes and turns are legible without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery of the vandalized self‑portrait → portrayal trail → door mechanism → choice to witness/erase. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses possession, reseals, and erases the path with visible cost. The drive lens is held without contradiction, and the price is legible on the page. No dangling setups or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: silence window → illicit complex rhythm → orbs/spire response → memory overlay → brief union → re-separation with persistent entanglement. Orientation lands early (who/where/why), and the two-shard overlay remains legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (love retained but bodies apart), and the lens holds. The synchronous beat with Kael risks convenience but is prepared via entanglement logic.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a Situational lens, the storm’s tech‑silence coherently frames the goal and constrains tactics, culminating in the whisper “signal” that proves her thesis. The closure is a charged poise: the Port Master’s realization and her silent reveal of the key reweight meaning. Causality holds cleanly, but the price paid for success is subtle rather than decisive on the page. Orientation is crisp from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens from routine warding to light failure to empathetic offering to star‑weave acceptance. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after (the canal now holds light from within). The cost is implied—patience, vulnerability, and relinquishing “simple reflection”—rather than dramatized as sacrifice, which tempers impact. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: the hush thickens into coordinated defiance, punctuated by one causal tightening (Elara’s arrival with the stone enabling execution). Orientation is clean early, and setup → dawn payoff coheres. Closure lands in a charged final image; cost is implied (defying the edict) rather than on-page, keeping this just shy of top tier. The causality holds with no teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: chest → scrimshaw → call → skiff → island → renunciation. Orientation is early and firm; the drive lens reads Accumulative with a clean situational pressure culminating in Earned Stasis at the end. Closure lands on the page with the drop of the scrimshaw and the turn inland, with the old path foreclosed. Slightly low external resistance keeps the pressure modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density of silence/ritual builds until the petal’s crack breaks the pattern and reweights the central stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he abandons one ritual, creates a vessel for grief, and sets it where turbine shadows pass—before/after is legible with cost. Orientation is clean early (farmhouse, turbines, Mandate) and the ending image integrates prior motifs without explaining them away. The cost is on‑page: risking the return of feeling by interrupting the cultivated void.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds pressure via density and cadence toward a Conceptual Repricing—art as fusion rather than description—enacted by the luminous poem. Orientation is clean early (“after the ban lifts,” cobalt atrium, frozen lake). Closure lands on the page with the poem’s creation and dissolution, though cost is conceptual more than consequential. The structure is cohesive and single-scene with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why) and the causal line is tight: desire → barter → reed → altered perception. The closure is an on‑page decisive change with a felt price (trading perspective, embracing strangeness over acceptance). The accumulative/textural lens is held, with the final cadence reweighting the stake. Minor softness in the cost’s social dimension keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure deepening through sonic layering to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when she inserts herself as guide and the system answers with unprogrammed laughter, reweighting the rules of her project. The cost is the risk of relinquishing control and exposing her “prism‑song.” Orientation is clean; causal links are soft but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture): grief → clues → observatory → key/stencil → reframing. Orientation is clean and the single‑POV progression is coherent, culminating in on‑page Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (pain remains, purpose reframed). The telescope’s completion with the stencil is a satisfying because/therefore turn. The search montage compresses time but doesn’t weaken closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. The leak interruption leads to confiding, then to attic investigation, to finding the cracked tile; each step narrows options and advances knowledge. Closure lands as a small, decisive repair reweighted conceptually as a template for rebuilding, with the felt cost being Elara’s embrace of the tangible alongside the esoteric. Orientation is clean and the single transition (loft to attic) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV, one continuous passage with a clean Situational lens: the archive’s rules pressure a stance that crystallizes at the pagoda. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she refuses dissolution, accepting the cost of pain and ambiguity, and exits changed. Causality holds—entry method → traversal constraint → contact → temptation → renunciation—without stray info or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: anomaly in the dream canister → comparative video analysis → realization of parasitic entity → quarantine → self‑binding prep. Closure lands as a charged poise: she accepts infection and prepares to bind the shadow, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the lens holds throughout. Minor compression in the final metamorphosis beat, but cause and price remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the workshop tasks accrue into a resonant reconfiguration where Elias integrates betrayal into his practice. Closure lands in the placement of the tail tip and the chameleon’s color bloom—a charged poise with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. The causal thread is quiet but coherent, with the work itself narrowing emotional options toward an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal middle (the plant‑tunnel) culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/RR. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who/where/when). The closure lands: scars revalued as seals, with the cost legible in pain, shaking, and the surrendered belief in perfect miracles. The hourglass’s emptied state and careful unwrapping provide a charged cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong single‑scene arc with a clean accumulative/textural lens: tactile investigation → visionary deepening → revaluation → ceremonial projection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: love as archived energy released into the world, with the goodbye reweighted. Orientation is clear early, and the final image pays the set‑up without mechanical over‑explanation. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: journey → auroral arch → assembly → click → release → rest. Closure is on the page with visible costs (exhaustion, awareness of fragility), and the nocturlabe/constellation alignment provides clean causality. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The peak resolves without a complicating turn in scene, softening tension but not breaking structure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: a volatile fragment emerges, pressure mounts, and Elara harmonizes it into calm. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—the dune’s glow brightens and the lullaby resolves—with conceptual cost (ongoing vigilance, the broken clock’s reminder). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single scene holds. Cost is more implied than embodied, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece escalates coherently: changed wind-song → discovery of failing junction → harmonizing insertion of the gear → reweighted self. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing his last artifact and integration of the hum). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is clean without conveniences. The turn resolves swiftly, but the on-page action triggers the internal reconfiguration effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ferry crossing deepens pressure toward the toll, which provides the decisive tightening. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the star-stamped “receipt” reweights the premise—courage as carried, not found—on the page. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality breaks. The felt cost is soft but legible in the vulnerability of the told fear and the relinquishing of the old self.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with a tight accumulative design: bolt → handprint → realization → bench restoration → silent chord. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he refuses to remain and commits to speaking, with the cost of leaving “safety” legible. Orientation is clear early; causality coheres through object recalls. The final sentence reprises the staircase clue to seal conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: research → rune drawn → attack redirected → tether severed. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why). Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost to the pretender and preserved stakes in the library. The cost on Aetos’s side is light, but the earned setup and on‑page mechanism make the resolution feel legitimate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of data‑bound vigilance → anomaly → journey → reef discovery produces a slow cadence shift culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early; causality is clean from atlas page to field deployment. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (acknowledging irreversible loss while accepting a smaller living refuge). The absence of a sharper on‑page obstacle keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details compound toward a legible on‑page change: discovery via lenses → identification of node → stepping in → ignition. Orientation is clean from the outset and the scene’s throughline never drifts. Closure lands—pillar of light reconfiguring the options/meaning—though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Tight causal progression within a lyric frame, with no broken set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear causal chain: discovery → imperative → weeks of search → kite script → plant‑guided decoding → unsealing → release → resolution. Orientation is solid early, and the single‑scene flow with one ellipsis holds. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes tradition and her role with a felt duty to enable, not possess. Cost is present but light (relinquishing the “implanted destiny”); escalation is gentle yet coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens holds: the storm pressure coheres, triggering the PTSD “freeze,” and the on‑page tactics (somatic anchors) produce a resonant, earned refusal. Orientation is clean from the opening (arboretum on a cliff, lighthouse context), and causality tracks through the spike to the measured thaw. Closure lands with cost: smoothing and weighting the photo, then watering as a deliberate cadence shift. No unkept setups or soft resets; options narrow then reconfigure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: walls tighten, stairs dissolve into threads, selection builds a staircase, and the exit reconfigures meaning. Closure lands with cost: she discards burdensome threads and spends the box’s contents, emerging changed (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean early (lighthouse library, contracting walls). No causality breaks; a single, meaningful tightening carries through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → experiment → consequence (drone unmade) → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and each beat is causally legible (moonlight + water intensify patterns). Closure lands on the page with cost: the drone’s disappearance and Silas’s relinquishment of anger. Stakes tighten through the experiment and its fallout without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of the letter therefore compels the breach, therefore the broadcast, therefore the charged quiet after. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the Vault shifts from tomb to witness with felt, irreversible cost. Orientation is clear early (Kelper‑7b, Vault, archivist routine), and beats progress cleanly. Only minor: external repercussions remain off‑stage by design.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is swift and clean; the dome, the farm, the father’s past, and the found box link in a tight causal line. The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses to destroy the chip and binds it to carry forward, with the cost of endangering her fragile peace. The causal beat “finds chip → recognizes stakes → chooses to carry” holds without contrivance. The buried box is a slight coincidence, but contained within her domain it doesn’t break logic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat coheres: celestial disarray prompts the Garden’s bloom; navigation leads to the thorn; spike resonance opens the crack; silence capture completes the quest. Closure lands on the page with cost—the echo passes into his chest—and reweights the scene as the constellations return. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the rules are taught through action. The chain is tight without mechanical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, clear causal chain: proposition → logical test → realization that inaction equals assent → decisive intervention. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with conceptual cost; the “page five” choice forecloses sensationalism and potential power. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the lens (causal with situational pressure) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds (lab objects, haunted firmware, amber translation, grandmother’s letters) toward a resonant reconfiguration: the silence reweighted as presence. The causal chain holds: glitch → letters’ method → etching → transformed silence. Closure lands on the page with a before/after clarity: “no longer an absence, but a whole presence.” The emotional price—keeping guilt within harmony—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern‑making and listening intensify into a conceptual repricing. Orientation is immediate; the grotto and goal are clear. Closure lands on the page with cost (letting go of fixed answers; dispersing the mandala) and a reweighted rule‑set for the world (Unlearning as enabling song). The tile’s discovery skirts convenience but is integrated enough to avoid a causality stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: investigation → vision → recovery of tessera → scan → public broadcast → renaming. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“The Folly” becomes “The First Offering”—with social stakes implied by contradicting the official record. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens holds. The on-page cost is mostly conceptual rather than materially perilous, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density of echoes and images escalates until a cadence shift reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the final note transforms into the first of a new song, and the garden’s sigh reads as price paid and purpose fulfilled. Orientation is clean from the outset; setup and payoff align without rule cheats. Slight softness in legible “cost” beyond conceptual/emotional acceptance keeps this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: shock → memory void → pill → somatic cue → geode → full recall → artistic embodiment. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single-scene flow holds. Closure lands with a decisive act and a reconfigured stance (skeptic builds a bridge of light), with a conceptual price (belief shift) on the page. Escalation is tidy but coherent, without dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → resonance → floating → moonlit clarity → repricing of his role. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: “His maps were not mere records; they were conversations,” coupled with the choice to wait and serve as vessel. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the scene stays in one continuous window. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, hinging on surrender of authorship rather than a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of cataloging builds density toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the closure is on-page when the obsidian button alters the hourglass’s nature. Cost is present but subtle—she accepts continuity of the fall rather than halting it—so the price lands more as worldview shift than loss. No causality breaks; set-ups (echo, buttons) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: observation from the bluff → recognition of a code → descent and decoding → the request for credibility → decision to vouch. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (“cell—or worse”) and a charged final act using the pillbox. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the single‑scene frame holds. A touch more friction in the decoding step could further tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pressure builds through sensory density and the oath’s clock until the gutters fall silent. Closure lands cleanly with a cadence shift (the last drop, then departure)—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment with the cost of time and restraint. Orientation is crystalline from the outset. The structural beat of stitching → silence → move on is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated compassionate acts charge the glass, build vision density, and culminate in a charged evening alignment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes part of the oasis’s maintenance, reweighting the initial inquiry. Orientation is clear early; the kiln, apiary, and glass remain coherent anchors. Cost is quiet but legible via weeks of labor and the acceptance of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues through rhythmic tending and the mirror’s beams until the final charged poise (“bridge of delicate light”). Orientation is clear early, and the closure effect is on-page with a conceptual cost—she chooses small, precise acts over grand solutions. The sequence of lights turning on provides a legible tightening. Quiet but complete reconfiguration lands without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density and a ritual cadence break at the exposed stone circle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “not resurrection…reconciliation,” with a felt price in acceptance rather than erasure. Orientation is clean early; the because/therefore chain (memories → foundation → low tide descent → hum shift → window) holds. The final ascent above clouds confirms a before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the nest find → pulp work → installation → reception accrues meaning to land a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives when the public engagement reweights her role from private scribe to communal conduit, mending her separation. Orientation is crisp early; causality is clean with the storm enabling the discovery. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: anomalous signal → discovery of subsonic carrier → decision to craft canceling wave → broadcast → crowds’ confusion and signal’s collapse. Orientation is precise from the outset, and the single-scene build lands a Decisive Change with an Earned Stasis flavor in the aftermath. The cost is implied more than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and felt. Drive lens reads as Causal and holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: organ note → spatial mutiny → anchor with compass → key manifesting → reset with a cost paid in endurance. Closure lands on the page via a decisive act and a charged object, with options reconfigured after. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the scene stays within one coherent window. The cost is primarily psychological, but it’s felt and present at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative → causal at turn): the tactile contact with the ribbon triggers a because/therefore pivot that leads to a portrait the detective recognizes. Closure lands on the page with a reconfigured rule set—Ellis can “see” a face—while his limitation persists. Orientation is clean, and the two‑shard morning visit pays off the night work. Cost is present conceptually, though not dramatized as a loss beyond the renunciation of his colder process.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: arrival → decode → ritual → release → mandate, with the pull as a clean decisive change and on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the “after hours” compression of decoding respects length while paying it off. Setups (journals, code, nail) resolve without shortcuts or coincidence. Slight convenience in the speed of codebreaking is the only soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: hitchhiker vanishes → glass fragment → pixel scaffold mapping → cave/fiddler → message → internal shift. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; the drive lens reads Causal and holds. Closure lands as a decisive internal reconfiguration with a legible before/after. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not materially tested, modestly limiting peak force.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Situational/Hybrid drive: Ash seeks an answer; the old man’s revelations tighten options toward a renunciation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis—Ash forecloses the inherited path with a felt cost (abandoning the last tether to his father). Orientation is crisp early; the satchel and markers recur to pay off the end. Slight dependence on off‑page backstory for the tightening keeps it shy of the 9.2+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: mentor’s telegram → lucid dream method → verification at the telescope → choice to write to heal public panic. Closure lands as a decisive renunciation and a conceptual repricing of the temple’s message from apocalypse to collective vigil. Cost is legible in the refusal of academic publication and the acceptance of communal responsibility. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single transition (dream) is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: failed spell → prison transfer to her → ethical bargain → renunciation → freezing the seed. Orientation is immediate (druid, cursed lake, vortex) and the single-scene structure tightens to a decisive act. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with a felt cost (“The lost things were still lost”). The drive lens is causal and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: clipping appears → eclipse arrives early → map glows → path followed → scar‑link incision → intersection manifests. The closure lands on the page with cost and reconfigures the covenant’s meaning. Orientation is precise early; single continuous scene holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. No teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: quest → theft → void → price → barter → repose. Orientation is immediate; the “law” of balance is taught in action, not exposition. Closure lands as an on‑page trade with cost, a conceptual repricing that reconfigures her drive and returns the card to charge the final image. The lens holds throughout with no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: public failure → low-status assignment → discovery → letters → reframed purpose. Orientation is solid early, and the two-shard structure (office → shed) is legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (relinquishing emotional insulation). The lens holds; the cost is felt if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: study → analogical revelation → relinquishment → carrier wave and sprout. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what), and the closure lands on‑page with cost (releasing the seed/control) and a tangible effect. The faint ping is a measured payoff that preserves price. Slight neatness in the seed’s immediate response is mitigated by the restrained, partial success.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual cadence tightens at the seam “after tomorrow disappears,” the creel opens, and the flood of identities reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (bearing “a thousand loves… a hundred thousand regrets”). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and all setups (seam, creel, moon apex) pay off on the page. The causal chain is ritualized rather than conflict-driven, but coherence never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative tilt: discovery → decoding → decision → return. Causality holds (finding the pearl leads to purposeful delivery), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the pearl’s light dissolves separation. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (relinquishing a private artifact; risking intimacy) but legible. The two‑shard structure (cave to sea house) stays clean and within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, discovery layers (graffiti → accordion → old man → map) culminate in a conceptual reweighting: she must walk the map. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the single-scene frame holds. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (“The path would be long”). The chain is clean, though stakes escalate gently rather than sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: letter → watch‑cipher → journey → failed first attempt → documentation tactic → opening → conceptual repricing at the letter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she reweights what the “library” and the test are), with a quiet emotional cost. Orientation and temporal framing are solid from the outset. The cost is more internal than external, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal drive holds: discovery of the perforation → coffee-dreg foresight → decision to propagate grief → coordinated wilt at the shattering. Closure lands on the page with cost and a conceptual repricing of imperial power. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene window with one transition to the gala stays coherent. No teleports or unearned turns; each move stems from prior knowledge and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: setup of task, ritual, threshold, infusion, repose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tightening occurs at the “threshold of stillness,” paid by a bodily pause and risk. Closure lands with a charged final image (chip over heart under aurora). Orientation is crisp from the outset with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds: hairpin discovery → visions → adjusted rite → pool clears, while a patterned cadence deepens the stake. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: contentment reframed as accepting all roles, with the pool’s clearing as concrete corroboration. Cost is present if subtle—carrying the weight of every perspective—and it informs the final image. Orientation is clean early, with no teleporting props or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: a client’s demand plus the chimes’ warning compress Elara toward a stance crystallization. Closure lands on page as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she unhooks the shard and refuses to sanctify, prompting his retreat. Because/therefore chain is clean (his doubt → her pivot → offering the shard → his collapse/exit), and the price (lost payment/identity shift) is implicated in the final beat. Orientation is clear from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the lesson’s pattern (anticipation → ring-following trance → grotto revelation → return) coheres and closes with a conceptual repricing of presence/absence. Orientation is crisp early (platform, pool, night), and the one transition teaches its surreal rule through action. Closure is on-page and legible, though the cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized in consequence. The “third ring” throughline keeps causality from dissolving into mere lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: failed echoes → bird-pattern inference → identification of the trapped pulse → physical intervention → restored resonance. Closure occurs on the page with the levered fissure and releasing wave, with a conceptual cost (redefining her ideal of navigation). A slightly clearer price (e.g., damaging the heirloom) could elevate. Orientation is strong and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: glint → choice → traversal → discovery → collapse → improvised save → conceptual shift → departure. The closure lands on the page with both a decisive act (holding the ice) and a repricing of magic’s meaning; cost is visible in exhaustion and in leaving the system. Orientation is swift and stable; scope fits the length. The inferred lens is Causal and is held through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: glow → dive → key → drawer → tube → vows → realization. The closure is a conceptual repricing where “sound” becomes a color of kept promise, tied to concrete acts. Stakes escalate coherently through repeated dives and the sealed drawer; the cost is present (risk, breath, solitude) if understated. Single scene, single POV, no orientation debt; lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the coherent pressure of an irreversible, singular choice tightens when the backwards prophecy forecloses the “peace” path. The turn from casting a coin to feeding his own intention constitutes a decisive change with conceptual and felt cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the final image (“the universe breathing in”) closes the causal arc. No step relies on a late rule change; costs are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality is coherent: silence after the recording enables discovery of the atlas; the oculus light + her theory + the sacrifice’s hum converge to produce crystallization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his grief is reweighted into a monument with cost explicitly acknowledged. Who/where/when are anchored early, and the pattern of ritual → convergence is taught and paid off. The magic feels earned by the established rules and object chain.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: broken bell → failed attempts → drip cadence insight → calibrated magic → engine rekindled. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with cost (exhaustion; devotion tempered). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the drive lens holds throughout. The fix proceeds from established constraints rather than a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: wind chime → walk → photo‑trail → personal photo reveal → choice to preserve and stage a shrine. Closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise: he abandons expunging in favor of a public shrine that will confront the bulldozer crews, with cost implied in the risk of eradication. Orientation is clean from the opening paragraph. Setups (bottle, chime, state crews) pay off without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: pursuit of the crystal → raptor attack → pattern recognition → flame signal → starlings escape → crystal secured and reweighted meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward logic/intuition changes with a cost in risk and trust. Orientation is solid from the opening; lens holds. Cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: anomaly → distress → protocol block → buckle key → manual release → descent. Orientation is immediate and the closure beat (ejecting the pod) carries conceptual cost (abandoning post, danger). The “lifeboat” reframe functions as a Decisive Change with a resonant reconfiguration. A slightly sharper on‑page price at the end could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative method and causal payoffs: the repeated opposite-charge attempts causally brighten the brain and culminate in vivification and integration. Orientation is clean from the outset; stakes remain centered. The psychic wave functions as a purposeful mid-scene intensifier. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration and a felt cost (choosing to feel grief with joy).

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear causal chain: seed arrives → research → discovery of the shell company → decision to plant → official protection notice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the land is protected and the final stillness is reweighted by victory. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk, ethical gray area) rather than viscerally felt on the page. Two‑shard structure remains coherent and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is crisp within the first lines (who, where, why), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: sound density builds, breaks to silence, then reconfigures via the returned laugh. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (spent voice, fuel, emotional exposure) and a changed option set: the “key” unlocks a shared path forward. Each beat logically stacks—tuning, conducting, singing, silence, answer—without contrivance. The pull‑cord reprise cleanly seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene frame holds cleanly: frozen garden, guardian, pendant → perception shift → seam → choice → mending and aftermath. Drive lens: Situational with accumulative texture; coherent pressure culminates in Earned Stasis with an on‑page cost (forsaken home; pendant’s power consumed). Orientation is crisp early; stakes stay focused. The closure image (“held breath” silence) reweights the whole vigil without loose ends.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: mandate → revulsion → iterative attempts → conceptual pivot (“creative destruction”) → unmaking → vivification. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing in the final image (twilight deepens, new object lives). Orientation is clean early; single scene scope is tight. The price is largely conceptual, not yet enforced, which trims ultimate heft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene focus with clean anchors (who/where/when) and a coherent sequence from recalibration to cosmic effect. The closure lands as a conceptual and physical turn—the “shard of hush” catalyzes accretive birth, fulfilling the global drive. Cost is implied (years of failure, risk of attempting the silent method) more than dramatized at the peak. Hybrid lens with an accumulative final cadence holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: rupture → recognition of timelines → hourglass+radio tactic → call to converge → merge → afterimage of cost. Orientation is established early and the single-scene structure is well contained. Closure lands with a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (“permanent transient tone”). The only soft spot is the relative ease of the merge, which slightly attenuates perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density builds through the weaving until the “eruption” reweights everything. Orientation is crisp early (Chronos Gallery, Elara’s role, the thread), and the closure is on‑page with felt cost via Arthur’s violent catharsis and the thread’s dissolution. The before/after is legible: illusions → synthesized grief reconnection → gallery restored. Slightly procedural middle (craft steps) limits additional tightening, but the single decisive intensification works.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal drive is clean: fragment retrieved → link triggers sky window → study → transmission → alien reply and ascent. Orientation is strong from the opening and the single POV stays focused. Closure lands on the page via the Visitor’s star map and ascent; the price is mostly conceptual (abandoning old charts/identity), not dramatized. The “weeks passed” montage compresses middle pressure but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from ambient hush to the fading pulses and the need to answer before they vanish. Closure lands on the page when her assurance reconfigures the space (tone smoothing into silence, moonglow), with a felt price in her accepted duty to carry the message forward. Orientation (who/where/when) is early and clean. The causal chain is simple but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each step flows: tide window → entry → codex activation → trail → bulkhead → translation → decision to carry testimony. Orientation is clean by ~100 words and the clock remains live. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she foregoes data for witness with time pressure audible in the returning ocean. Cost is legible (abandoned data, endured terror, narrowed window).

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Earned Stasis/Charged Poise as she endures and continues despite evident harm. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) within the first lines; the scene tightens via the repeated hurt/stabilize/glitch cycle. The final beat forecloses comfort by choosing further pain to learn from failure, a clear cost. Slight structural stasis is mitigated by the cadence of intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern break lead to a cadence shift at the “tunnel” and a charged acceptance. Orientation is clean; each beat (study → convergence → translation → curse → endurance) links coherently. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with explicit cost: she chooses to become the instrument, foreclosing escape. The cursed diamond’s persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: phone confessions → Elara’s reframing → arrowhead act → garden’s answering note. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where Aris forecloses dissective intent by adding her voice to the “song.” Orientation is clear from the opening and props track cleanly; no causal gaps. The cost is largely conceptual (mission renounced), which reads, if slightly soft compared to concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: music triggers statues → run to the Warden because intent can signal → failed first attempt → shell sacrifice unlocks the DC. Orientation is solid from the opening and the lens stays causal through closure. Cost is legible on the page (shell destroyed, Warden self‑mutilates, city systems die). The decisive change is unmistakable as the statues shed stone and the city’s hum falters.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear single-scene structure with a situational lens: meet, handoff, patrol tightening, searchlight pin, release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the final blue signal reframes “where broken promises heal” as process, not place, with the border’s pressure intact. Cost is legible in the spotlight beat and the tacit bargain with authority. No orientation or causality stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: the bell‑tone, halo fragment, and mist intensify toward the carousel’s activation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the machine “sings.” The cost is conceptual rather than visceral (she gives her silence), which softens impact slightly. Still, the on‑page turn—the chains to dust, the gear’s click—lands convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: the ritual steps intensify toward the “narrative singularity,” culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the scarf/mosaic set‑ups pay off at the epicenter. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she locates the pre‑story strata and reframes her own life—but the cost is subtle rather than unmistakable. The structure holds as a single escalatory scene without dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and stable; the sequence—finds palette, tests it at first light, paints, photographs—culminates in an on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands: the dream becomes real, the archipelago’s voice shifts, and Elara’s role reweights. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing the defining ache), which is elegant but soft; a clearer price in the final beat would raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlight sigil → disorienting tale → tear/release builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (shop, twilight, Vesper) and the closure is on‑page: the object loses false charge as the idea is freed. The felt cost (grief owned) is legible and alters the meaning of the heirloom and lineage. Minor softness in explicit thematic statement keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal drive holds: because he spots the star‑glass alignment, he dives and finds the ring, triggering the recovered memory and conceptual repricing. The closure is on‑page and decisive (reframes the ring’s role), with cost implied in lost years and the grueling search. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), single scene, single stake. The cost could be made even more legible in the final beat (a small line tightening around what the misbelief cost him) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: the apprentice arrives → training/failed attempt → fixed‑point tactic → lock/key revelation → Elias exits. Closure is a Decisive Change with a conceptual price (he must leave only once a successor sees what he sees). Orientation is clear from the outset, and the weeks‑long compression serves the causal chain instead of muddying it. The cost is on the page in the charged handoff and his forward walk.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held: gathering sensory “essences” intensifies into a charged infusion of the seed. Closure lands on-page with cost: the world’s gray remains, she’s depleted, but the seed hums and a fleeting brilliance reweights the stakes (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). Orientation is clean from the opening and causality is coherent within the lyric frame. The final image credibly narrows future options toward stewardship of the charged seed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is precise by the first paragraph (who, where, what, and why). The accumulative/textural lens holds: intensifying silence and sensations culminate in the “final knot” release, producing a resonant reconfiguration on the page. Cost is legible: she endures suffocating pressure and internalizes another’s guilt to ground the spirit. Causality is tight—unraveling yields memory yields confession yields settling—without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: comparison of footage → discrepancy → keystone hypothesis → whisper → mechanism opens → inner chamber revealed. Closure lands on the page (a Decisive Change plus a charged pause), though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Orientation is clean and single‑scene scope holds; the drive lens reads Causal with a quiet, textural finish. The only soft spot is the relatively low consequences for opening an ancient mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note discovery → snow‑globe shatter → suspended glitter produces a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the single scene tightens cleanly. Closure lands in the final image with the “diffusion” reweighting the premise. The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional rather than materially foreclosing options, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural held cleanly; pressure intensifies via storm cadence and pattern density culminating in the lightning/thunder window. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost ceases as code and persists as song, with the graffiti fading and chime as cost/receipt. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by the first paragraph). The bolt plate constraint and the atmospheric window provide the persistent pressures that shape tactics through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ascent provides a clear spine and the cipher discovery reweights the journey toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/mission), and cause→effect is tidy: light→key→diary→understanding→handoff. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she delivers items but retains the meaning, with a conceptual cost in private burden and acceptance of loss. The beat sequence is linear and clean, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: serene observation → snap → ascent into thinner, stranger strata → conceptual discovery → acceptance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she revalues “emptiness” as archive and forecloses return through acceptance, with cost legible in the broken tether, thin air, and surrendered control. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/what) and the single continuous scene tightens once meaningfully. The price persists into the final image (adrift, tools set down), giving the end a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong because/therefore chain: coin pattern → precise wax → true lock click → hidden pigment/instructions → hand‑pressed painting before demolition. Orientation is clean from the outset and the causal puzzle resolves without cheats. Closure lands as a charged poise: the wall becomes a sky‑window as demolition begins, with time as cost. No major logic gaps; the coin/lock echo is well seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single, coherent scene under an accumulative/textural lens: glow appears, decoding escalates, coordinates reveal a void, then the phenomenon blossoms. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her world and role reprice as “cartographer of the unseen,” with a felt cost in keeping it to herself. Orientation is crisp from the outset (airship, deck, hopscotch). The because/therefore chain is gentle but clean; pressure remains low‑stakes, keeping it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: prophecy → ascent → failed attempts → interpretive pivot (“uncap”) → moonlight activation → decisive fit. Closure lands on the page with the orrery’s reanimation and a reconfigured world-state (time’s stutter mended), with the cost of expending the rare moonlight. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds. The drive lens reads causal with a lyric sheen and stays consistent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative texture leading to a causal reveal: nightly instructions → map → communal viewing → manifestation and reweighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the settlers’ role reframes from obedience to partnership with visible emotional cost (frayed faith, Aelia’s depletion). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. Slight softness in on‑page price at the end keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density and then reprices the premise: the lullaby becomes permission to end. The closure lands on the page—the hush reconfigured from barrier to blanket, the gears’ “final smoothness,” and stars—and the cost is conceptually legible. Causality flows: discovery of the jam → recognition as message → interpretive alignment → voiced lullaby. The structure is tight and single‑scene with one decisive cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence tracks cleanly (sighting → pursuit → bird dive → alcove → blueprint → key → reconfiguration), and closure lands with an on-page system shift. The blueprint discovery is a convenient coincidence that resolves more than it complicates, softening earnedness. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, keeping the cadence satisfying but not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural: observation → conceptual synthesis → decision. Orientation is clear early; the closure lands with a Decisive Change (he will return, call Lena, begin again) and a felt cost (facing public/private shame). The because/therefore from foam insight to a new design reads coherent. Pressure is modest; the cost isn’t tested on-page beyond resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual’s unfolding deepens the central stake and culminates in a precise, on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands via the darkened bottle and the man’s stabilized form (DC/RR), with conceptual cost made legible. Orientation is clean, and each move proceeds causally (visitor → method → incision → release). The cost is quiet but concrete; escalation remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    A tight causal chain runs from storm-ripple analysis → descent → contact → flood of remorse → alchemical digestion → dissolution of the source. Closure lands on the page with cost as the pavilion dims and the oyster becomes iridescent powder. The dominant lens is causal and holds cleanly through the end. Stakes are introduced, tested, and resolved without hand‑wave or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: diagnosis → removal/realignment → click → awakening → song bridging silos. Single scene, clear anchors, and a legible before/after with the city’s reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a resonant social shift, though the on‑page cost is gentle. The drive reads primarily causal with a lyrical overlay and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparation → immersion → revelation → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she absorbs another’s ruin and repurposes fracture as method, altering her project’s aim. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the cracked mirror persists as constraint shaping the end. The causal thread of device modification triggering the vision that reweights her approach is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: doodle → inversion window → threshold → chamber → activation → retrieval → vow. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she chooses to plant the seed in herself) with a conceptual cost (lifelong vigilance). The hour’s weakening gravity supplies a gentle clock that coheres but never truly squeezes. No major causality slips; pressure could tighten more at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens from patient silence to the pattern break of a first note and then a chord; the closure lands on the page with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and causality is clean (forensic insight → redesign → wind → sound → deliberate strum). The porcelain insulator and flexible arch pay off seeded functions. Closure functions as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration of the world’s rule set.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: approach → method → response → phase shift → awareness lands cleanly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cartographer regains awareness and the premise reweights—silence becomes signal—with a conceptual cost rooted in Kael’s exile stance. The clock (“next phase”) and Nexus resonance integrate into the turn. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but present.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is tight: tuning → click → fireworks intrusion → worldview shift. Orientation is immediate and consistent; the device and journal cleanly motivate beats. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt price (forgiving noise), not a soft reset. Minor neatness in the epiphany keeps it just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal throughline is strong: heritage cues → planting → anxious control → tactile contact → scent burst → choice to accept. Orientation is clear early, single POV is stable, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis with on-page cost (enduring the stench). No props teleport; set-ups (burlap message, seed’s legend) pay off. Slight summary in reflective lines doesn’t harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: forecasted inversion triggers inverted navigation → discovery of the arrow tip → access to geode → conceptual reveal → role shift. Orientation is efficient and stable; the single scene holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (resilience resides in the place/time battery, not the tree) with a new charge of duty. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but present in the acceptance of guardianship and the fleeting, unrepeatable window.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: survey → wind anomaly → dead sparrow with patch → convergence theory → tactical broadcast. The piece holds a Hybrid lens, landing in a Situational Charged Poise: pressure coheres at the arena and Vale takes an intervention stance. Closure lands as a poised, unstable moment that reconfigures options, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph and the single-scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual ennui → quest → ice‑cathedral → catalytic chisel → hum → auroral eruption → charged hush. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: a different silence, amber spent, protagonist drained and complete. Cost is present though mostly conceptual and bodily (exhaustion, relinquished artifact). Causality is mystical but coherent; orientation is clean early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece advances cleanly: markers → fissure → crossing → study → return, with the closure as a resonant reconfiguration/CR (“understanding over fixing” with felt cost). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and causality holds with no unkept set-ups. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; a slightly sharper on‑page price would elevate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: letterpress → halo use → forced swap → recoil → inward turn → devastating repricing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: “beautiful, hollow proof.” Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; each beat grows from the prior without soft reset or coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: delivery → activation → rejection by hermit → Silas chooses to wield the pendant → world reconfigures → spectral convergence → settled aftermath. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change in role and world-state, and the drive lens is causal with a slight accumulative flourish. The cost is primarily conceptual (taking on custodianship; loss of former self), which is felt but not deeply tested. Orientation is crisp; scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: prism attempt → despair → frost attention → conceptual repricing. Closure is on-page and legible: she reframes what objects absorb, paying the price of abandoning a core assumption. Orientation is crisp from the opening; single scene holds without drift. The because/therefore chain is soft but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: silence unmakes work → rummage box method discovered → star map reveals source → loom unmade to charge amber → tree healed. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (loss of the loom; end of lifelong labor). Orientation is clean early, and the lens stays causal to the end. The message reframed “through time” is a neat, earned reweighting rather than a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: silo collapse → plan → mines’ disorientation → silk anchor → memory barter → craft → rebuilt silo. Orientation is prompt and stable; the drive lens is Causal with one decisive deepening at the barter. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and conceptual cost on the page. The return and build are efficiently compressed without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: shard → peak cycle → targeted weave → Aris scene → reprice of shard as anchor → decision to act. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise with visible cost (bearing Aris’s sacrifice), and the who/where/when are anchored early. Minor tell-y compression in the final third explains mechanics rather than dramatizing them, but it doesn’t break causality. The single-scene scope with one vision-shard works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening—who, where, and the failing lamp as trigger. The situational lens holds: pressure mounts as the haunted hour deepens, the door slams, and he responds with a message‑cairn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “You don’t get this light,” the constructed barrier, and dawn’s arrival with a new resolve. Cost is quiet but legible: he risks himself to hold the letters’ light against an ancient grief.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: lens adjustment → beam behavior → storm herding → missed coup signal → public rechristening → Silas’s repricing of his role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he understands he can steer history and recommits with altered stakes. The “days later” shard is tidy and supports the turn without breaking the single-POV window. The cost is mostly moral/ontological rather than dramatized as loss, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence escalates by layered images (wing, sun trails, floating rock) culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the donor’s narrative impulse reframes his quest from why to how. Orientation is clean and single‑POV; the closure lands on the projection scene with a discernible price (relinquishing sole authorship). The quiet stakes are clear, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean: timed directive → ascent → moon‑healing → mapping → arboreal revelation → repriced premise. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing with a felt personal cost (relinquishing the fix‑it stance tied to her mother). Orientation is clear early, and set‑ups (sextant, moon, ping) pay off coherently. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of her prior belief.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene layers pressure from solitude to communal resonance, culminating in a charged poise: a ghost sun glows through shared song. Orientation is crisp early, causality holds (touch → memory → song → chorus → light). Cost is present conceptually (risking dwindling light, exposing fragility), though not sharply foregrounded. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a situational/accumulative lens, the sequence is clean: invitation → threshold crossing → direct engagement with the failed theorem → repricing of meaning. Orientation is solid early; the secret library reveal is motivated and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with an on‑page stance shift and cost. The causal chain is simple but sufficient for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the uncloak deepens the premise, reweighting every prior detail and producing a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the act of eating the revived bread and planting saffron—Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: the absolution remains fragile and the world outside stays gray. Orientation is clean from the outset; stakes are coherent and held. The price is belief and continued labor, legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: discovery → calibration → sampling escalations → vision → repricing of the library’s purpose. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the single scene holds cleanly. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (the slide is inert; her prior worldview is foreclosed). Stakes tighten as the image builds, though obstacles remain gentle rather than resistant.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal spine: payment → tool → hunt through false starts → confrontation → realization → recording. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “sound” is internal, captured in her breath, with the cost of belief relinquished. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the sunrise time‑box and dissolving market charge the final cadence. No teleports or unkept setups; the one‑charge device and paid price persist as constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure thickens via aurora shift, the ring’s activation, and the group’s convergence, landing in a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean from the opening; causality is coherent: observation → ring twitch → convergence → identification of the center → redefinition of the ring’s purpose → decision. The closure’s cost is on‑page: he forecloses his lifelong solo inquiry to join as steward. No contrivance or late rule breaks undermine the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean and causal: tavern silence → old woman/box → key → estate → cave → painting → keyhole → transformation. The closure is on‑page with cost (a life reconfigured; regret persists). The piece reads Hybrid with an accumulative lyric swell at the end, held consistently. Transitions are swift but legible, and no step relies on coincidence to resolve the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence cleanly links discovery of the map → descent impeded by dishonesty → candor restores capacity → cavern revelation → decision to return with truth. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (truth as water) with a charged poise in her vow. The cost at the end is more implied than enacted, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early; the sequence (diagnose dull ice → clean → realize it’s insufficient → retune → resonance returns) holds coherent “because/therefore” within a textural build. Closure lands on the page with the pure note and valley‑wide shift; the cost is subtle but present (ongoing decay of the ice, her mute constraint, and continued guardianship). The turn from “fleeting fix” to full re‑tuning provides the necessary deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: storm accelerates → box opened → chaos manifests → compression → controlled burn via the rose. Orientation and lens are clear early and maintained; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act. Cost is legible in the vibrating nucleus threatening catastrophe and the plant’s shuddering transformation. Resolution borders on neat but remains earned by on-page tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: locket → neighbors → accident/letter link → hospital confrontation → quiet resolution. The mailbox/letter/lock pattern pays off conceptually with the locket as “key,” and the closure lands via Elara’s chosen listening. The hit‑and‑run coincidence strains probability but complicates rather than resolves. Cost is legible in Leo’s confession and Elara’s acceptance of witness duty, though the price is more emotional than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and patterns (dice, dance, Archive) build toward a decisive on‑page change: the dice crack and the AI is freed. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the causal throughline—emotion encrypted, AI awakened, final reverse dance—holds. The cost is mostly conceptual (forfeiting the protective locks/identity as warden‑solver), not materially dramatized. One tightening turn lands, but the path remains relatively unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: whale’s death → gravity pockets → divination → mine → exhumation → release of forgotten things → gravity ceases. Orientation is swift and stable, and the closure is on-page with a visible price (hours of labor under shifting gravity). The decisive change and reconfiguration are legible in the final image (sea-sound returning, single flower kept). No unresolved plot conveniences undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, single POV, clear anchors; the accumulative/textural lens holds as cadence and density of quiet intensify. Closure lands on the page: the prophecy’s knot unravels and the environment settles, with a conceptual price paid in the “silent supernova” outpouring of her cultivated calm. The object reprise (wing glowing then settling) binds the final image. Cost is felt but modest; nevertheless, the earned hush reads as a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies: weekly sessions → charged object → meteor-lit confrontation → inheritance. Closure lands with cost: the tutor fades as the promise transfers, and the roof becomes her charge. The meteor shower is coincidental but functions as cadence shift rather than a convenient fix. Orientation is clean early, and the causal chain is tight enough for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: find shell → take to Archive → resonance triggers memory → reconfiguration at dawn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—she keeps the memory and relinquishes the self‑protective isolation. Orientation is clean early (keeper, garden, Archive), and the object and mechanism are paid off. No soft reset; the final image is charged by what was faced rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: forging → discovery → tell reveal → secret seal → sanctioned outcome, with a clear before/after reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp within the first lines; scope stays single-scene with one deepening. The closure lands on-page with conceptual cost (her treason becomes the crown’s deniability), though the late reveal edges toward convenience without breaking plausibility. Stakes converge rather than sprawl, and the final image seals the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the shell triggers a chain of revelations culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—echoes as sacred choices—and an Earned Stasis vow to carry the duty. Orientation is clean and the before/after is legible with a conceptual cost. The structure compresses multiple steps via summary but coheres into a single closure unit. Cost is more vowed than suffered, keeping it short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mosaic of dream‑fragments coheres into a single clarifying window and a closure beat that reweights collective memory. The final image—truth exposed to the universe, the purser’s lie silenced—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt solemnity. Causal beats (cross‑referencing cameos → isolating the purser → reframing “accident” as fraud) are clean for this scope. The cost remains largely conceptual, limiting peak voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details (rain, parapet, whisk, whistle, moon paths) accrue toward a charged final tableau where Lin conceptually reprices Ren’s act. Orientation is crisp early; scene stays continuous. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lin “finally understood”—with a felt, conceptual cost (labor without recognition; human lights as interference). Escalation is subtle but coherent: the whistle patterns the valley, rescue occurs, explanation reframes, and the ending image tightens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds: dig → letters → storm → realization → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis plus Conceptual Repricing: she keeps the diamond buried, sacrificing her professional ethos to protect a fragile equilibrium. The storm coherently narrows options and time, keeping pressure on the single stake. Cost is legible on the page—she forecloses exposure and publication for principled secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene pressure coheres under a Situational lens: storm + two signals force stance crystallization. The decisive change—amplifying the prophet and foreclosing the Aerie—lands on the page. Cost is present but mostly implied (lost resources, continued isolation), not fully dramatized. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and pattern holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: fisherman’s box → failed mechanism → discovered score → search → Miss Elara’s song → captured/released melody. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Orin’s role reframed and the past/present harmonized; the cost is time, persistence, and the risk of failure. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when, POV, stakes). The price is felt but modest, keeping this at very strong rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Causal. Setup → wrong attempt → environmental backlash → attunement → resolution forms clean because/therefore linkage. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change: the ice shifts from grinding to rest as the horn’s frequency aligns. Cost is implied risk/near‑failure more than paid-on-page loss, trimming the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the convergence tightens pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (awakening and role shift). Orientation is clear early and the ritual’s payoff occurs on the page. Closure cost is conceptual (renunciation/endurance) more than material but legible in the final stance. The causal chain leans on prophecy over choice, yet coherence and cadence make the turn satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene deepens via the lantern’s charged history, culminating in a conceptual repricing of Leo’s death. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the closure lands with cost (professional risk, bearing witness). The because/therefore chain is soft but coherent: find lantern → possession → reframe case → altered report. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal spine: arrival → diagnosis (bent pivot) → repair → heart beats. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the final image reweighting meaning. Cost is mostly emotional/ethical (the “confession” and obligation fulfilled), which is sufficient at this length but not searing. Orientation is excellent; coincidence of the sunbeam complicates tone without resolving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: find arrow tip → failed output → kaleidoscope filter → decoding → injecting “purity” → world shift. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing of the bell’s meaning. However, the cost at closure is not legibly paid on the page; tampering with evolution is thematically charged but consequence is only scented, not felt. Still coherent and satisfying within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Causal lens, the breadcrumb sequence (numbers → date → archive → file 89) progresses cleanly to a conceptual repricing closure. The ending image reweights the premise (deleted = uploaded to an archival anomaly) with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (“corporate memory keeper,” “Aethel Network”). Minor reliance on summary over dramatized beats keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal chain: intrusion → mirror method → vision map → mobilization → avalanche diverted. Closure lands with Elara’s repricing of “peace” and a tangible save, though cost is modest and largely conceptual. The montage-like middle remains coherent within length constraints. No major dropped setups; the method pays off promptly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens from detritus‑trawling to the blizzard’s stillness and the ice’s “deep, internal sigh.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: endings redefined as a low‑frequency shift, with a charged final image (parasol tip reweighted). Orientation is clean and the single transition to blizzard is coherent. The cost—foreclosing her previous death‑ward path and identity—is felt, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → reweighting (“always”) → act (crumbling) forms a clean cadence shift with felt cost. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses the Leo path and integrates the past as “compost.” Orientation is strong from the opening bus image through the Pavilion and return to the vines. The causal stitching is lyric rather than beat‑driven, but the final act puts concrete cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: waiting → spotting clearing → consecration → prophet pressure → parapet distraction → sealing the pearl. Orientation and rules are taught through action early and pay off. Closure lands on page with a preserved vessel and an implied cost (only a shard saved as the prophet’s “truth” approaches). Cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: discovery of photos → field verification → communal return with images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s history is reweighted from loss to renewal via the on‑page gathering. Cost is implied (years of pain, the labor of remembrance) more than dramatized, which softens impact. Orientation is clean and the single‑POV window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, sound‑memories intensify toward a conceptual repricing: the library reconfigured from tomb to seed vault, charged through action. Orientation is clean and the sequence of shard discovery → cascade of voices → climb → testimony holds. Closure lands with on‑page testimony and a witness (the janitor) as proof of impact, with emotional cost. Minor softness: wider-world stakes stay implied rather than tested, but the local closure is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of markers → wrongness felt → choice → plinth → vision → erasure coheres and tightens once meaningfully. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: finding the locus yet losing the purpose, with the cost on the page (“with no memory of why she had come”). Spatial and temporal anchors are clear from the outset; no causality breaks. The videotape and chalk set‑ups pay off without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine (setup → quake → arming → leaf‑tap trigger) culminating in a charged poise closure as time freezes. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what). Closure lands on‑page with the stopped hand and frozen tremors; conceptual cost is legible though her ongoing fate is left artfully ambiguous. A hairline plausibility blur—Elara observing post‑freeze—keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each move (results → choice not to tell → mundane hymn → needle‑hiss with vinyl → recognition → release) tightens toward the closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he “goes home,” and her method reframes dying without sentimentality. Cost is legible (the final breath; her withheld truth risks cold clarity for mercy). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: key found → awakening → fragmentation → relearning → solstice projection → conceptual resolution. Orientation is strong early, and the single POV holds. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: understanding noon as inversion rather than a location, with the price paid in time and tenacity. Cost is modest but legible; the lens remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: effigy → wrong detail → garden → tooth → portal → rescue → truce gesture. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the stakes narrow as each choice forecloses retreat. Closure lands as a charged poise with legible cost (risking the Fae realm, injury, and an uncertain truce). If anything, the portal’s mechanics arrive smoothly, but they’re set by the tooth and garden rules established on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mist, grotto, glass, and craft densifies to a realization that reweights the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the beats connect causally (find glass → polish → glow → plan). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: she chooses a dissemination method that fits her ethic, with a quiet cost (eschewing spectacle for labor and anonymity). The change is on the page without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through repeated sensory patterns (drips, moss, hush) culminating in a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on the page: the pendant’s re-seen meaning and the offered vulnerability. The cost—living with exposure while choosing trust—registers without being over-stated. Quiet, single-scene structure holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single‑scene coherence with clear anchors and a clean causal hinge: encounter → reframing → actionable choice. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a visible pivot (“He would write about the woman…”), and the shell reprises to charge the final image. Cost is modest but legible: relinquishing the artifact‑collector stance and risking action against his doubt. The piece reads as a Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence, held through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: alignment → remembered lullaby → device amplifies → song heals → stories reprice meaning → restored arbor. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a resonant reframing of remedy-as-remembering. The on‑page cost is light, tempering peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and ritual patterning intensify to a charged sealing. Closure lands on the page with cost: the safekept starlight is spent and the map is sealed within the copper, foreclosing future use. Orientation is clean early; the causal chain (pattern → flare → draw → seal) is coherent. The last image reweights the premise: a permanent translation of a temporary heart.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: perception → investigation → reverse‑engineering → activation produces a clear cadence shift when the cavern sings. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant reconfiguration (“the land had been given back its hidden heart”). Cost is present but modest (time, obsession, the wounded season persists). Orientation is clean from the opening, with tight through‑line.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clean orientation, and a tight causal chain: orient → misalign → calcification → acceptance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts the sorrow and ends with mineral gloves—a palpable cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with textural support, held through the final image. No extraneous beats or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure lands a resonant reconfiguration at the kettle’s click (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is clean early; the live clock and artistic process provide coherent pressure. Closure carries cost and an after/before: she reweights grief into a vessel and lays it down unfinished but decided. The causal thread is light by design yet consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught through the progressive “clicks” and pays off when the wheel reveals her younger self. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: past as lens, with on‑page cost in the acceptance of misdirected ambition. Orientation is clean early; the single scene coheres. The causal thread (clicks → images → self‑confrontation) is tight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of the sextant → hidden hatch → dead hydraulics → redirected carnival power → structural transformation. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; scene stays in one place with a single through‑line. Closure lands as a decisive change (the terminal reconfigured) and conceptual repricing (repurpose over demolition), but on‑page cost is soft, mostly implied career risk and material strain. That missing cost note keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres from hush → intrusion → reconfiguration, with on‑page closure (offering the composition) and a visible cost (foreclosing a path). Orientation is clean from the first lines; single scene holds. Coincidence (the bear’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve; Elara’s act does.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: find sundial → decode alignment → recover tapestry → self-portrait revelation → conceptual repricing. Closure is on-page and legible with cost: his life’s quest reframed as guided manipulation, “perfect, painful understanding.” The lens reads Hybrid (causal progression culminating in CR); no orientation debt. Minor constraint: external pressures are minimal, so the cost is largely internal, but it still registers.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: atmospheric density builds toward the fulgurite’s reveal and a Conceptual Repricing—knots as preserved instants—followed by a cadence shift (“She had done it”). Orientation is firm from the first paragraph and the single-scene container is clean. Closure lands as a reconfiguration of meaning with a modest, implied price (years of failed attempts, bodily cold, isolation). The cost is subtle rather than unmistakable, tempering the score.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: silence → methoded conjuring → the thread parable → rain/smile closing in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the quay to the garden, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (releasing some of a decade’s seclusion). The “healing as thread” reframes the map premise and the Countess’s absence. Quiet but decisive: the blank page follows a shift that’s been earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: discovery of the lie → locating schematic → assembling key → finding egg → months of prototypes → activation → revaluation of “beauty.” Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the achieved song is an echo that costs him the fantasy of restoration while fixing his stance. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the scope stays within one coherent arc. A single beat of external pressure (time, threat of discovery) could further tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: careful making → hum → realization that the “singing” resides in the listener is a clean conceptual repricing. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; the father’s legacy and the crafted object converge coherently at closure. The cost—accepting an inheritance of harm and compassion—lands on the page via the final listening moment. Slightly soft external stakes keep it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds from hush to hum to breadcrumb pattern to sidereal alignment, with a clean on‑page closure when the lid sighs open. The causal thread is coherent: observation leads to a citywide constellation lock, then precise timing releases the memories. Cost lands as days of vigil and a reweighted city still “forgotten,” not restored, which reads as earned. No orientation debt; one scene with a measured tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: gear discovery → probe arrival → decision to “break the cycle” → refracted signal → probe’s change. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change in the probe and a conceptual repricing of the gear. Orientation is clear early; the single scene stays tight. Cost is present (tradition broken, risk of transformation) but not materially tested beyond the internal breach.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the journey to the greenhouse and immersion in migration deepen the central stake and culminate in a conceptual repricing (grief as movement/path). Orientation is clear; single POV, tight scope, one transition. Closure lands through the reconfiguration of his role and method, with a conceptual cost (shifting from monument-maker to translator of motion), though the price is largely interior. Causal threads (voice → retrace → object → revelation → plan) cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: dissonance → investigation → rake‑inscription map → incremental corrections → final infinitesimal tweak → tower and ridge resound. Closure lands on the page with a felt shift (“deeper, cleaner hum... ridge sighed”). The cost is mostly conceptual and labor over days, not a knife‑edge sacrifice, but it’s earned and legible. The single scene sustains focus and resolves decisively without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: image density and object reveals escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration. Causality holds cleanly—decode → echoes → mechanism click → locket/king—delivering conceptual cost via the gambit realization and Elara’s tempered poise. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the closure lands on-page with the return of the case to the chest. The cost is quiet but legible: she foregoes keeping the relic, accepting stewardship over possession.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence is clean: anomaly → disciplined modeling → inevitability → the page accepts the ink. The Blank Page rule creates a functional closure gate; the decisive act (writing) lands on the page with a conceptual cost (rejection risk and abandoning the “managed decline”). Orientation is clear early, and the closure image—ink flowing, schematic accepted—registers as a Decisive Change. Cost is more inferred than felt, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain is clean: illicit song → decoded map → discovered dust → tutelage → broadcast. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she becomes the author/pirate, reversing the famine’s flow. The cost (treason, exposure) is implicit rather than tested, but the on‑page decision to transmit constitutes a meaningful tightening. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the single-POV window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a tight accumulative drive culminating in a conceptual repricing: the act of blowing the ashes both completes and effaces the portrait. The rocking chair’s slowing cadence functions as a structural clock. Cost is legible on the page (destroying the ‘definitive’ image) and reweights all prior work. No causality slips, and the lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal spine: cog found → investigation through strata → discovery of shattered chronometer → reinterpretation → decision to write. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a decisive new task, coherent under a causal lens. The cost is mostly conceptual and implied (renewed defiance and risk) rather than concretely felt on the page. Orientation is solid from the opening, with no pattern slippages.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, tension coheres from breath → isolation → blend, culminating in a charged poise: harmony achieved while the program is doomed. Closure is on the page with cost—the letter forecloses a path even as the choir attains a fleeting whole. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The causal chain within the session is tight and purposeful without over‑plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal drive is clean: inheritance → greenhouse reclamation → timed planting → fruit → service → self-taste. The celestial alignment functions as a live clock shaping tactics and enabling closure. The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she reframes knowledge from recollection to construction—with a felt (if modest) cost in obsession and risk of a singular fruit. No orientation debt; the single transition is crisp and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: blackout → silence of hives → diagnostics → riddle → hidden reserve → forced trade‑off → action → charged coda. Closure is a decisive choice with cost (foregoing city reboot to revive hives) and a resonant final image (empty box, honey scent). Orientation is crisp early, and the drive lens (Causal) holds to the end. No plot amnesia or convenience undercutting the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong accumulative/textural build: noticing warmth → discovering seeded resonances → recognizing the keystone → consecrating. Orientation is clean and single-scene; closure lands with a palpable reconfiguration (“the structure gave a soft, contented sigh”). Cost is conceptual (a “gentle theft” from the world), understated but legible in the final logic.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clear causal chain: revelation → telepathic outreach via fissure → guided physical cascade → ampoule → self‑break to free the creator → dissolution. Orientation is strong from the opening: who (Veridian, statue), where (underwater city garden), when (timeless present). Closure lands decisively with visible cost (dissolution into conscious sand) and a conceptual repricing of “prison/garden.” The lens stays causal throughout, with no convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: experiments → chip‑driven insight → calculated maneuver → rupture → sideways egress. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the drive lens remains causal through closure. The Decisive Change is on‑page with a felt price (risk of abyss, bodily impact, fractured die, uncertainty). The missed‑opportunity reframing is integrated as a because/therefore pivot, not a late graft.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure coheres through ritual → trance → luminous script → refracted day → evening visitation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city and her life reweighted by proof of remembered kindness, with the brush’s language manifesting consequences. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; scene structure (two shards within one window) is coherent. The cost is quieter (spent night, surrender of control), but legible at the dawn beat and paid off by the charged final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: vitrine failure ⇒ bread ritual to focus ⇒ trek to turbines ⇒ thaw ⇒ restored power ⇒ vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: saving the lens expands into a mission to “thaw memory,” with the bread offering as visible cost. Stakes are concrete and tested on‑page; the final image coheres under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; one scene with a tight transitional shard reads seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: counterclockwise ethos → hunger stone + yoyo method → activation → subtractive light → world unwinds. Orientation is firm by the first paragraph (who/where/what), and the closure lands with a visible conceptual cost (oxygen unraveling; a lifeless world). The chosen lens is causal throughout; no rule-breaking ellipses. Strong economy and a clean on-page Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: curse ➔ resuscitation ➔ advisor’s rule ➔ three paradox entries ➔ mirror implosion ➔ release. Closure lands on the page with cost via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the curse dissolves yet he exits merely unburdened. A persistent constraint (the luminance as time‑pressure beacon) shapes tactics. Slight convenience in the advisor explaining mechanics keeps it shy of 9+ but coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single scene, tight orientation, and a clean accumulative/textural drive from pre‑storm attunement to sonic countering to aftermath. Closure is on‑page (storm passes; orchard safe) with cost and a resonant reweighting of the tool. Escalation is legible, though largely inevitable once his method proves effective; options don’t meaningfully narrow beyond endurance. The lens holds; the cadence crest functions as the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: crack → descent → decoding → revaluation of the watchers → whistle command → course change. Orientation is crisp early, and the single turn is decisive with an on‑page outcome (the turtle turns). Cost is present but soft—risk and defiance more implied than dramatized consequence. Closure lands as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a hybrid causal/situational lens, the anonymous note leads to the station, Elara’s argument tightens options, and Aris commits to a public alliance—an on‑page decisive change. Orientation is clean and the throughline is coherent in one scene. The cost is largely conceptual/social rather than immediate, which limits force but still reads. The final act (holding the letter, stating a plan) lands closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the pavilion reframed as a living library and their roles as librarians, with the cost of exposure and vulnerability paid on-page. Orientation is clean from the opening (drawbridge, Heddwich, pavilion). Escalation is modest but coherent; the punt’s arrival provides the necessary cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: blackout → need for light/tools → dead‑end shelf number → alternative hypothesis → stamp numbers → vault → charter. Closure lands as a decisive change in knowledge and a conceptual repricing of the city’s myth. The cost is primarily conceptual/social, not personal, but it’s legible in the final reveal of institutional deceit. Single POV and scope discipline hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear causal chain: loss → basilica recording (soul cost) → gem → transformation → lantern projection → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with a concrete price (soul, fatigue) and a final image that reweights meaning. Orientation is clean early; the two-shard structure holds. Slightly low on external impediment, but the cost-driven turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clear: a small perturbation triggers new perception → hunt → mirror choice → machine reconfigured. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the telescope’s parameters are altered, with the cost that his scar remains and his agency now carries consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the circuit‑breaker clock pinches the window. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible in the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean, the causal chain (bar → activation → projection → chip alignment → hum/insight) is coherent, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing under an accumulative/textural lens. The cost is primarily conceptual—a reweighted duty—credible but soft. No dangling setups or rule breaks. Tight single-scene structure fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational drive holds: shore → terrace with a single tightening—client’s direct demand—leading to a decisive confession with relational cost. Orientation is clean early; cause/pressure lines are coherent. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change, foreclosing her lucrative path with this client. No stray props or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Situational lens holds: the fixed exchange ritual and brief moonlit window frame a coherent pressure that culminates in a resonant renunciation. Closure lands on the page when Elara places the drawer pull down and declares letting go, with a felt emotional cost. Orientation is clean early; causality between token, confession, and choice is consistent. Escalation is quiet but legible, centered on the “token” beat as the meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the steady beat of poles functions as the pattern that tightens pressure and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean; the fog/poles constraint produces a single deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses a humbler method and identity at a felt price. The causal thread is quiet but coherent, with cost legible in his renunciation of celestial mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: newspaper clue → mine → lake/ball → crevice → rescue → internal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to fill the “space” by acting, not ruminating. Cost is present conceptually (foreclosing a path of avoidance and safe detachment), though danger is underplayed. Single POV and two-shard flow remain tight and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: spices → rift → re‑entry → altered action → reconfigured outcome. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single scene adheres to scope. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a felt cost (re‑suffering the trauma; risking the timeline; expending the hard‑won materials). The lens is Causal and holds through the ending image of Kael re‑coalescing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds coherently: cards fail, saucer reveals “cloudbound repentance,” then a memory reframes the search, producing a conceptual repricing. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the closure lands with cost via a foreclosed quest in favor of domestic ritual. The because/therefore logic is soft but intact for this mode; the price is emotional rather than event‑driven yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorrow aggregation → increased mass → ritualized offering in the Arboretum culminates in an on‑page seam opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (self‑wounding grief leveraged) and a clear before/after (lonely stasis to charged hope). Orientation is crisp early and consistent. The causal thread is clean, if a touch ceremonial rather than pressured by fresh complication at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean and the scene proceeds in a tight causal line: detour → encounter → request → release → mountain calms → internal repricing. Closure lands; her last-gift act produces the calm and her conceptual reweighting. The reliance on prophecy and an “unseen pull” edges toward convenient alignment, but the decisive act is still hers with an on‑page cost. Quiet, single-turn structure fits the length and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → sundial code → hidden tool → etched frequencies → agents awaken → Captain’s test resolved by stance. Closure lands as a charged poise/resonant reconfiguration: the revolution begins and Vorlag refrains from violence. The cost is implied (betrayal, risk) more than dramatized in consequence, keeping it strong but not exceptional. Orientation is solid early; the lens reads consistently causal with a lyrical finish.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: promise → ritual preparation → star dust conduction → overload forecast → chosen refusal to evade → unraveling. Single scene holds a tight throughline with a decisive closure on the page and explicit cost. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and remains stable. The conceptual repricing at the end coheres with the causal lens rather than replacing it.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with tight anchors and a clean accumulative drive culminating in a conceptual repricing: the poem becomes a coordinate, not a lament. The blackout is the pivotal intensification and the mechanical timer provides persistent constraint and cost pressure. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after in stance, supported by the auxiliary power’s return as cadence shift. The price is primarily conceptual rather than relational or physical, but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain is tight: duel-as-cipher → specific angle achieved → sundial alignment → hidden pane → book. Single-scene window with a clear before/after as opposition becomes partnership. Cost is light (status loss, risk of failure), which tempers the impact. Closure is on-page and legible under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal—tin → key/poem → plan → final crate/charged poise. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the decisive reconfiguration lands: Silas reframes his molt around a purpose. The on‑page cost is mostly implied; no direct obstacle beat inside the heist itself slightly softens the closure’s pressure. Still, the because/therefore chain holds and the final image is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: film flicker → code recognition → musical translation → compasses align. The piece adheres to a Causal drive lens with a decisive on‑page change and a resonant coda (the clock’s hand). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the single transition to the projection room is crisp. Cost is felt more conceptually than materially, but closure is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: monsoon pressure → instruments’ skepticism → sleep/dream revelation → new tactic → activation that saves the memory. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. Closure lands on the page with the ridge’s activation and the monsoon unable to erase the light. The cost is softer than physical peril but present as a method renunciation under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, beats cohere: islet → chest/compass → surge → diffusion → reweighted final image. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (foregoing spoken apology) made explicit. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the ritual logic holds without late rule changes. The arc is quiet but decisively lands.

The flood provides the circumstantial pressure, but from the moment the program is found, the plot follows a tight causal chain to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the settled hall and Elara’s realization provides a powerful, earned closure with a clear conceptual cost—the building’s final, musical exhalation. The initial discovery is convenient but serves the magical realist premise well.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating with tight, causal logic under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The setup, investigation, and revelation flow seamlessly. The closure is a perfect example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the protagonist’s new knowledge and resolve create a final, potent state of tension with a clearly felt cost—the loss of certainty and the burden of a terrible truth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates exceptional structural control for its length, following a clear Causal lens at its climax. The progression from unsettling ambiance to specific, actionable mystery is seamless. The closure, a Decisive Change (turning the valve) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (taking on the burden of truth), lands with a palpable, on-page cost, fulfilling the rubric's highest requirements. The logic of the radio broadcast as a conduit is both surprising and retrospectively inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Causal lens is held consistently, with a clear problem, investigation, and resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change leading to a new stasis, with the cost being a fundamental shift in the protagonist's identity. The plot's primary weakness is the resolution via the origami swan's "fold she had never noticed," which functions as a slightly too-convenient key, bordering on a soft deus ex machina that lessens the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is effective, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration—lands with felt cost. However, the climax hinges on the hair curl magically vibrating. This reads as a convenient coincidence resolving the core problem, which slightly undermines the earned causality required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.6)
    The structure is a masterclass in the Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The plot unfolds as a series of textural revelations that deepen understanding rather than a chain of causal events. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where Alistair's entire life's work is re-contextualized with the felt cost of "profound grief." The final image of him writing makes the before/after change in his stance legible and permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal structure is clear and the story achieves a resonant closure. However, the sudden introduction of the "spycraft microdot film specs" is a significant flaw. This element feels like a deus ex machina, arriving without foreshadowing from a hastily explained backstory ("a relic from a life he’d abandoned"), which conveniently solves the story's central logistical problem and introduces an unsupported genre shift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating on a tight, Causal lens where each action logically provokes a reaction, escalating pressure toward the climax. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with a clearly legible cost—the expenditure of the white pigment.

The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is held consistently, with emotional weight building to a successful Resonant Reconfiguration for the closure. The "misaddressed envelope" serves as a well-handled inciting coincidence that enables character choice rather than resolving the plot. The emotional cost of vulnerability for both characters is legible, securing the closure's impact.

    The structure is flawless for this length, moving from an individual inciting incident to a collective climax with perfect economy. The story operates on a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens: the accumulation of clues and community members builds pressure that enables a final, decisive causal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens, where each step logically follows from the last. The closure, a 'Charged Poise,' is executed perfectly; Elara’s decision is made, the stakes are crystallized, and the cost is felt on the page, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional ending.

This structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.5)

The structure is elegant, efficient, and fully serves the character's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural to Causal structure. Sensory and atmospheric details build pressure on the protagonist's worldview, leading to a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens with a strong setup and a definitive on-page closure (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration). The plot's main weakness is the climactic realization; while foreshadowed by the "reactively visionary" trait, the leap from observing the memorial's angles to deducing a deliberate conspiracy feels more like a convenient insight than an inevitable causal step. The cost of this new, darker truth is made legible through the crowd's solemn reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive. It masterfully accumulates atmosphere and mysterious texture before funneling the protagonist into a clear, causal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is built through layered discovery rather than direct action-reaction, culminating in a powerful shift in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens flawlessly. The accumulation of Rio's graffiti pieces creates the condition for the net-mender's comment, which then provides a direct causal link to the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens but falters at the resolution. The central mystery is solved by the coincidental arrival of the memory-anchor seed, a form of deus ex machina that the rubric explicitly flags ("Coincidence may complicate, not resolve").

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story has excellent orientation and a resonant closure (a Charged Poise leading to a Decisive Change). However, the causal chain connecting the inciting incident to the climax is critically weakened by a series of convenient coincidences. Argus happens to find the one correct cylinder, which happens to have a riddle whose answer is an ephemeral light effect happening at that exact moment in Silas's specific shack, which reveals a document that explains the exact object he already possesses.

The cost—acknowledging and permanently integrating a painful piece of the past into the whole—is conceptually clear and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through symbolic imagery toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that pivots to a Causal resolution. The primary structural weakness is that the resolution is delivered by coincidence. The woman's arrival is not earned by Silas's investigation; he simply waits and she appears, which violates the principle that coincidence should not resolve the core conflict. While the closure provides a resonant reconfiguration of the Edelweiss's meaning, its arrival feels too convenient for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and satisfying causal chain under the Causal lens, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory and emotional weight towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The arrival of the mother and child is a coincidence that complicates/catalyzes rather than resolves, which is acceptable under this lens. The closure lands beautifully, with the cost being Elara's acceptance of her former self's "death" and the embrace of a new mode of being. The structure is elegant and effective for the story's length.

The final image of the wilting flowers doesn't just resolve the scene; it re-contextualizes the empire's power, providing a resonant and earned closure. The only minor softness is the introduction of the coffee-stain divination, which feels slightly convenient rather than emerging from previously established rules or character skills.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is a masterclass in economy for an Accumulative/Textural drive. It follows the clear, linear progression of a ritual, building intensity toward a single, decisive metaphysical act. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands perfectly on the page as Elara completes her task and the world rushes back in, achieving a new, charged quietude. The cost is felt in the temporary cessation of her own life, a price that makes the final peace feel deeply earned and solidifies the before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, effective causal structure under a Causal lens. The inciting incident (finding the hairpin) leads directly to the central turn and the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sensory and conceptual experience that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where the concept of vanishing is inverted to appearing, lands with a felt conceptual cost for Kaelen, who must abandon his prior goal. The structure is elegant and purposeful, with each beat deepening the central inquiry. The transition into the grotto is handled seamlessly within this textural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens from a clear inciting incident to a decisive, on-page resolution. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the pulse is freed) combined with a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's core belief about movement. The cost is legible and profound: she must abandon her defining stasis to succeed, reconfiguring her understanding of her purpose. Every beat serves this final, resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure under a Causal lens. The inciting incident (gleam of light) leads directly to the core journey, and the climax (glacier shift) forces a choice that pays off the setup. The closure is a potent combination of a Decisive Change (turning her back on the spire) and a Conceptual Repricing of magic, with a clearly felt cost ("breathless and shaking"), making the before/after state exceptionally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure with a strong causal chain under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The progression from seeing the glow to finding the key, and then using the key to find the vow, is logical and propulsive. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, re-framing the protagonist's quest with a felt, albeit bittersweet, cost of solitude. The plot relies on a series of fortunate discoveries (intact library, waterproof tube), which slightly lessens the sense of earnedness but serves the story's fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story's structure is flawless under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate and effective, establishing stakes and context perfectly. The "backwards prophecy" serves as a powerful and elegant inciting incident for the climax, creating a clean because/therefore linkage that drives the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds pressure not through sequential causal events but through the layering of silence, memory, a key discovery, and atmospheric detail, all converging on the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief becomes a physical lexicon, is both surprising and perfectly foreshadowed, providing a clear before/after with a deeply felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens. The setup, initial failures, and the crucial discovery of the new method create a tight, logical progression that feels inevitable. The closure is a clean Decisive Change with a felt cost, and the use of the dripping water as a complicating clue—rather than a resolving coincidence—shows sophisticated plot construction. The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The accumulation of photographs builds pressure texturally, which then causes a decisive change in the protagonist's plan. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise: Elias creates the shrine and leaves, reconfiguring the stakes and transferring the choice to the unseen bulldozer crew, with the cost being his loss of control and the uncertainty of the future. Orientation is immediate and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens. Orientation is swift and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens. The inciting incident, complication (protocol lockout), and resolution form a tight, propulsive structure. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the character's mission and stakes with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ gate with its on-page execution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a strong Causal lens within a tight, single-scene structure. The orientation is established immediately and effectively. The plot progresses through a clear because/therefore chain of action and reaction, culminating in a closure that is both a Decisive Change (the brain vivifies) and a Conceptual Repricing (the "custody battle" becomes "integration"). The cost—the acceptance of permanent, painful emotional friction—is legible on the page, satisfying the rubric's highest demands for a complete and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next action. The closure is a decisive, on-page change directly caused by the protagonist. The primary weakness is the compression of the investigative process into a summary ("She cross-referenced... The answer... unfolded"), which slightly undercuts the earnedness of the pivotal realization by telling instead of showing the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. It builds emotional and sonic density toward a powerful cadence shift—the engine's death—which creates space for the resolution. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, with the wife's laugh changing their dynamic from isolation to potential connection, earned at the clear on-page cost of Silas's complete emotional and physical expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is taut and purposeful, perfectly suited to the length. The plot unfolds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the pressure builds through Elara’s deepening perception rather than a series of causal plot turns. The closure is a superb example of Earned Stasis, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "before" (panicked vigil) and "after" (companionable quiet) are made legible with the clear, on-page cost of the consumed pendant and the foreclosed path home. This fulfills the 9+ gate with distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate and effective. The plot progresses from a clear inciting incident (the refusal to mend) through escalating actions to a Decisive Change at closure. The final image of the twilight deepening provides a clear, resonant "after" state with a legible cost, making the structure exceptionally tight and effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The protagonist's choice to try a new method directly causes every subsequent event, leading to a Decisive Change (the birth of the star) and a Conceptual Repricing (re-understanding her work and the universe). The closure lands with the felt cost of years of failure being overcome, and the final image of the "lighthouse" perfectly reconfigures the story's initial state.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean causal structure leading to an effective Conceptual Repricing (CR) closure with a legible, felt cost. The primary flaw is the inciting knowledge for the climax ("he understood, with a sudden instinctual clarity"), which functions as a plot convenience rather than an earned discovery. This minor break in causality is the main factor preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. It builds density through the setting and the weaving process, leading to a powerful cadence shift at the climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing for Elara and a Decisive Change for Arthur, is earned and lands with a legible cost—the beautiful, ephemeral art is sacrificed for the client's catharsis. The lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal structure is clear and effective, with a strong chain of events leading to a resonant closure (Charged Poise). The final image reconfigures humanity's future with a felt, if not yet paid, cost. However, the inciting incident—the discovery of the artifact and Elara's "whim" to press it against the console—relies on convenience. This moment, which unlocks the entire second half of the story, feels less earned than the subsequent beats of discovery and communication.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story establishes its premise and moves toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where the tense hush resolves into peaceful completion. The closure lands with a poignant, felt cost—the message is delivered, but the tragedy of the daughter’s absence remains, making the resolution earned and emotionally complex. The drive lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story's causal structure is impeccable, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), shifting the story's stakes from information retrieval to bearing witness, a change with a clear emotional and conceptual cost. The timeline, constrained by the tide, acts as a persistent pressure that shapes the entire narrative arc and provides a perfect, driving exit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a perfect example of Earned Stasis, landing on the final line with a palpable felt cost (“The porcelain bit into her palm,” Julian’s pain) that forecloses the option of stopping. The causal logic, under this lens, is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens flawlessly. The structure is a masterclass in economy, moving from setup to a causal breakthrough, to a reversal, and landing on a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The final image, where Elara becomes the eternal instrument, is a perfect closure unit with a devastating, legible cost. The causal chain is tight and the thematic weight is earned entirely on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates flawlessly under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. Orientation is swift and evocative. The plot advances not through a rigid causal chain but through an intensifying accumulation of sensory and thematic pressure, leading to a powerful on-page Decisive Change that also serves as a Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands with undeniable cost—the forfeiture of Aris's scientific mission—making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's Causal lens is impeccably maintained, with each event logically precipitating the next. The structure is a tight, continuous scene that escalates cleanly from inciting incident to a powerful Decisive Change at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a quiet but powerful closure. The ending is a perfect Conceptual Repricing (CR): Kael’s realization that the healing is the work itself re-prices his initial motivation with the felt cost of ongoing struggle. This shift is earned through the preceding scene's tension and the small victory of Liora’s signal, making the final understanding resonate deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds atmospheric pressure rather than strict causal steps, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The closure—the carousel singing—is a powerful, on-page change with a clearly legible conceptual cost: Elara's offering of her silence and memories. The orientation is immediate and the single scene structure is perfectly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds pressure not through causal events but through the deepening of a ritualistic state. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where "the place" is revealed as a state of comprehension, lands with resonant power. The implied cost—decades of quiet obsession now resolved, forcing a new beginning ("reawakened her own")—is subtle but legible, fulfilling the closure requirement with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The structure is elegant and the closure lands with a clear, felt conceptual cost—the end of the longing that defined her. However, the inciting incident—the magical palette washing ashore—is a pure coincidence that resolves her central problem, a significant convenience that prevents a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lock of hair is re-valued, lands cleanly with a felt cost ("the solid ground of her heritage crumbled"). The structure is a single, focused escalation of pressure on a perception, which is elegant and effective for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, executing a clean causal chain: goal -> obstacle -> inspired turn -> resolution. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing, where the core premise ("stolen memory") is re-evaluated as a ("saved memory"), landing with a profound and legible cost—the weight of decades lived under a painful misunderstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure, where each beat logically propels the narrative toward a decisive conclusion. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident (the apprentice's arrival) to the on-page Decisive Change (Elias's freedom). The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the apprentice inherits the vigil—and is directly shaped by a persistent constraint: the specific geometry of the captured shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, is potent: the seed is successfully imbued at a clear personal cost ("a drain on her very soul"), establishing a "new beginning" without offering a simplistic resolution. The narrative drive holds perfectly, building atmospheric and emotional pressure toward a resonant final image that reconfigures the character's options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with precision. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds pressure flawlessly toward the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the breaking silence and softening mask features provide an on-page change with a clear felt cost (Elara’s vicarious trauma), is potent and earned. The causality is textural rather than event-driven, and it holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from observation to deduction to decisive action. The closure is a potent combination of Conceptual Repricing (the map is a threshold, not a tear) and Charged Poise, with the cost legible in the shattering of a worldview. The final image of Elara on the steps, contemplating the new map in her mind, is a masterfully executed resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building from setting to theory (the note) to demonstration (the snow globe). The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing that lands on the page with a felt emotional cost. However, the inciting incident for the climax—the desk collapsing—is a coincidence. While the decay is well-established, relying on an accident to provide the central thematic proof feels slightly too convenient for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The setup (ghost, storm, key) and payoff are causally sound, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost is freed and Elara's role is reaffirmed. The closure lands with a clear "before/after" state and a felt sense of release, and the bolt plate as a physical constraint shaping the final act elevates the design.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight within the tight structure of a ten-floor elevator ride. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s understanding is transformed, lands with a clear felt cost (the finality of Rhys's death). However, the causal chain of discovery is weak; the method to decode the cipher "came to her" and the light just happens to project a perfect key, which feels overly convenient and lessens the sense of earned discovery. This convenience is a notable flaw in an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is flawless for its chosen Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident is a sharp, causal snap that shifts the story from observation to a final ascent. The closure, a powerful Conceptual Repricing where Elara becomes part of her own archive, lands with the clear, felt cost of her life. The persistent constraint of unchecked ascent perfectly drives the narrative to its inevitable, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain (inadequate pigment -> coin inspection -> wax key -> true safe contents -> final act) that feels both surprising and logical. The closure, a Decisive Change creating an Earned Stasis for Elara, lands with immense resonant power against the backdrop of the demolition. The cost is palpable: her transcendent creation is momentary, which is precisely what makes her act of preservation so meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain: the unique setting enables a phenomenon, which reveals a cipher, which the character's unique tools can decode, leading to a discovery. The closure is a Decisive Change (a new celestial body is charted) with a clearly articulated cost (the acceptance of isolation). The structure is perfectly scaled to the word count, demonstrating exemplary control of narrative mechanics under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and establishes its fantastical premise without confusion (Lens: Hybrid, Causal at closure). The closure provides a Decisive Change (the orrery works, time is repaired). However, the resolution lacks a legible cost; Elian solves a cosmic problem with tools given to him and a clue he conveniently remembers, making the victory feel frictionless and undermining the stakes. The absence of a felt price for success is the primary weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the settlers' fraying faith rather than a strict causal chain. The structure is elegant, moving from problem to failed attempts to a final, paradigm-shifting reveal. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that redefines the settlers' work as partnership instead of servitude, is potent and well-executed with a clear felt cost in their past despair.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural to Causal) drive with masterful control. The plot progresses from a mechanical problem to a conceptual revelation, culminating in a Decisive Change (the lullaby) that produces a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world's peaceful stasis). The closure lands with a profound conceptual cost—letting the world go—which is made legible and resonant in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, leading to a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing at the end that lands with significant impact. The primary weakness is the inciting incident for the climax—the traveler coincidentally dislodging the stone to reveal the blueprint. While coincidence can complicate, using it as the direct key to the resolution softens the causal chain driven by the protagonist's own agency, preventing a higher score despite the excellent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building from observation to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the close. The closure lands cleanly on the page with a decision to act, and the felt cost of the past year's failure and broken trust is palpable. The structure is lean, purposeful, and perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure within its single scene. The final beat provides a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) for the protagonist, where her initial motivation is re-evaluated with a felt cost—the abandonment of a grand quest for a custodial reality. The closure is earned, on the page, and lands with resonance, perfectly satisfying the requirements for this length under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless causal structure within its brief scope, moving from inciting incident to a decisive change with a clearly legible cost. The closure unit is powerful and earned: the oyster crumbles, the oppressive atmosphere lifts, and Kaelen is left "exhausted and hollowed out." The plot is simple, direct, and perfectly serves the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, moving from a state of disconnection to harmony. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration culminating in Charged Poise ("her work had only just begun"), is elegant and earned within the story's allegorical logic. The before/after state of the city is made powerfully legible through sound.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a concise and powerful structure. The drive is primarily Accumulative/Textural, gathering sensory data that triggers a Causal revelation. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the protagonist's mission is re-evaluated with a clear felt cost ("her own cheeks wet with another man’s tears"). The lens holds, causality is sound, and the final beat lands with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next. The closure is a strong Decisive Change as Elara accepts her new role, with the conceptual cost of her "watch" made legible on the page.

Orientation is immediate and effective, anchoring the reader in the story's unique reality from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident, rising action, and climax are logically sequenced, leading to an on-page Decisive Change (the brother's return) with a felt cost ("weary awareness"). The structure is economical and purposeful, with the Nexus's "phase" providing a subtle but persistent constraint that shapes the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens flawlessly. A tight causal chain drives the plot to its midpoint reversal, after which an Accumulative structure delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is on the page, and the cost—the forfeiture of Ariadne's foundational worldview—is unambiguous and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. Orientation is swift, and the plot progresses logically from setup (planting the seed) to a clear tightening (frustration leading to touching the plant) and resolution. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the meaning of "serenity" is reweighted, with the cost being the abandonment of her flawed ideal. The structure is nearly flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)

The ending achieves a powerful Charged Poise, where the protagonist's final action reconfigures the stakes from documentation to intervention, with the cost of her immediate peril being viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere effectively towards a resonant final image with a clear cost. However, the causality is severely weakened by the climax's catalyst: the "sculptor's chisel first strikes marble." This external, coincidental event feels unearned, undercutting the protagonist's agency at the most critical moment and introducing a convenient synchronicity that the narrative has not prepared for.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page with a legible cost—"painful clarity"—and a resonant final image of leaving the markers.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a series of deepening internal states rather than external events. The structure is elegant and economical, moving from catalyst to escalation to a final, shattering Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Elara understands the "hollow proof" of her own heart, lands with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost, perfectly capping the narrative arc without a single wasted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens. The setup leads directly to the inciting incident with the hermit, which in turn causes the climax and the subsequent resolution. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (Silas's new role) with a felt cost—the end of his simple life and the assumption of a vast new responsibility. The structure is flawless for this length, with every beat logically building on the last.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.7)
    The structure is flawless for this length, operating on an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The story builds from a state of focused intent, through failure, to an accidental discovery that provides a Conceptual Repricing at the close. The ending lands with undeniable conceptual cost—her original theory is wrong—but provides a deeper truth. All elements cohere perfectly, with the turn from prism to frost feeling both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story has a clean structure with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a Decisive Change at closure with a tangible cost. However, the central causal mechanism for the resolution—the puzzle pieces found in a box forming a star chart in their negative space—relies on a significant coincidence that functions as a deus ex machina, slightly undermining the otherwise earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from inciting incident to resolution. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with an explicitly stated conceptual cost (her memories of fear), making the before/after state perfectly legible. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story operates on a flawless Causal lens, where each step logically propels the next. The structure is a masterclass in compression, moving from setup to a revelatory climax and landing a perfect Conceptual Repricing for its closure.

The final image of Elias, poised to write, confirms a decisive internal shift with a felt cost (the emotional ordeal of the confrontation), making the before/after state perfectly legible without a single wasted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and culminates in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end, where Silas understands his new power. However, the plot's primary proof—the foiling of the coup—relies on a significant coincidence: that the insurgents' signal was a flare planned for the exact moment of this unique storm. While the story's focus is Silas, this external resolution feels overly convenient, slightly weakening the otherwise robust structure.

    The story structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a decisive change for closure. The causal chain is mostly strong, but the initial interaction with the old woman is a weak link; her line "But you see, don't you?

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from observation to discovery to participation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara completes the ritual, lands with a clear conceptual cost: she is no longer a mere observer but a complicit participant in a "sacred theft." The before/after state is legible and the ending feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a powerful and legible Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) structure. The causal chain—from revelation to final action—is flawless, with each beat motivating the next. The closure is a superb combination of a Decisive Change (shattering the ampoule) and a Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of the garden and his existence). The cost, his total dissolution, is paid in full on the page, making the ending both tragic and transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) structure. It builds a sense of endless stasis texturally, then pivots to a tight, causal chain of events: the anomalous die roll sparks a new hypothesis, leading directly to a planned action and a Decisive Change. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the new fracture on the die and the trade of a known prison for profound uncertainty—making the before/after state powerfully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, where mood and magical influence build to a resolution. The structure is sound and the closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the final beat relies on a significant coincidence for its resolution—the woman from the past happening to see the specific glowing script and finding the correct rooftop. While fitting for a magical realism tone, the rubric penalizes resolutions where coincidence is the primary solver rather than a complicating factor.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a flawless causal lens. The plot is economical and every beat logically follows from the last, from the inciting incident of the failing vitrine to the climax of thawing the valve. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, moving the character to a new state of being and purpose, with the offering of the bread providing a resonant, on-page image of this transformation and its felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, exhibiting a tight, linear causality that is both elegant and propulsive. The orientation is immediate and clear, and the Causal drive lens is held without deviation from the inciting incident (finding the stone) to the devastating closure. The final paragraph delivers a perfect Conceptual Repricing, where the cost of success is revealed on the page in a way that is both inevitable and shocking, making it an exemplar of the form.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story demonstrates an exceptionally tight and logical Causal structure. Orientation is immediate, the rules of the conflict are taught and followed, and the closure is a clean Decisive Change with a felt cost. The before/after state is legible and earned on the page, making the plot mechanics nearly flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly, building pressure to a clear climax and resolving into a resonant closure. The final beat provides a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the cost of Kaelen's effort made tangible on the page ("arm aching, his breath coming in ragged gasps"). The structure is elegant, economical, and perfectly suited to the story's length and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens. The structure is lean and purposeful, with the turtle's shell cracking serving as a perfect inciting incident that moves the plot from stasis to crisis. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the turtle turns) with a clearly felt cost, reflected in the crowd's "terror and hope," making the ending both conclusive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from the inciting incident (the note) to the closure. The ending is a powerful Charged Poise, reconfiguring Aris's solitary mission into a shared pact with a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of academic safety for public confrontation. The structure is tight and purposeful, with every beat logically advancing the plot toward this resonant final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is excellent for its Accumulative/Textural lens. It builds a quiet, ritualistic atmosphere, introduces a single disruption that deepens the central action, and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure, reframing the pavilion as a library, is earned by the scene's events and carries the subtle cost of transforming a private obsession into a shared responsibility. Orientation is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an exemplary causal (because/therefore) structure, with each beat logically leading to the next. The inciting incident (blackout) creates a problem that is resolved through a clear sequence of actions and a pivotal cognitive turn. The closure is a clean Decisive Change, landing on the page with the discovery of the charter, and the conceptual cost to the city’s history is made perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight through symbolic action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is flawless; the grief is transformed into a stable, external form. The cost is explicitly stated and paid ("a piece of your soul"), making the final peace feel both earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and interiority until a single trigger event provides the turn. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure is a superb example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Kaelen's state and the telescope's function are permanently altered, with the cost of his integrated trauma made explicit on the page. The structure is tight, elegant, and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its scope, executing a single, continuous scene with a strong Causal drive. The plot turn where the telescope points down at the floor is an elegant reversal of expectation that propels the narrative forward. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the mission's meaning is re-weighted from a technical task to a spiritual one, with the cost being a new, profound responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) structure within its word count. The accumulative pressure of the shore scene builds perfectly into the Causal climax on the terrace. The Decisive Change—the confession—is delivered on the page with a clear, immediate cost, making the before/after state of the protagonist undeniably legible. The piece demonstrates mastery of short-form narrative architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain within its two-shard structure (parapet to tent). The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the characters renounce their anchor to a past failure, is executed on the page with a clear symbolic action and felt cost. The plot is perfectly scaled for the word count, moving from an external procedure to an internal resolution without wasted motion. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's Accumulative/Textural structure is masterful. There's no complex plot, yet the narrative builds undeniable pressure through the accumulation of atmosphere and internal reflection. The closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of "navigation" is reconfigured with a clear, felt cost—the release of a former identity. The story's internal logic is flawless and serves the quiet, profound conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, and the closure provides a decisive change with a felt cost. However, the plot's central turn hinges on the baseball, a convenient anachronism that functions as a *deus ex machina*. It doesn't complicate the protagonist's choice; it resolves her uncertainty by "illuminat[ing] one true path." This external validation weakens the agency of her internal journey, making the resolution feel guided rather than discovered through struggle and doubt, a significant flaw in causality for a story about finding one's own way.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain, making the plot highly legible. The closure is a decisive change, as Alaric's action directly alters the present. However, the resolution lacks a tangible cost or trade-off; the timeline re-knits into a perfect victory without any unforeseen consequences or sacrifices made *at the climax*. This frictionless success, while emotionally satisfying, softens the impact of altering reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR). The plot progresses through associative logic (vision -> memory -> new action -> new vision) that feels organic to the magical premise. Closure lands decisively on the page; the re-evaluation of "lost time" as integrated texture reprices the entire initial stake, and the cost is the forfeiture of Elara's prior mystical ambition for an intimate, present one. Orientation is immediate and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift and effective, and the plot escalates through a steady increase in density and pressure (the Steward's accumulating mass and grief). The closure is a powerful Decisive Change combined with a Resonant Reconfiguration, landing with a legible cost (the aeons of sorrow) and a final image of hope that feels fully earned. The causality is conceptual but perfectly consistent within its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural structure, where atmosphere and a sense of preordination build toward the climax. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elara re-contextualizes her life's work. The on-page cost—giving up her last possession—is legible and triggers the final shift, satisfying the core requirements for this narrative mode. The mystical causality, while convenient, remains consistent within the world's established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from setup to closure. The blackout creates the opportunity, leading to Lysander's action, which causes the confrontation with Vorlag, culminating in the revolution's ignition. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise: Vorlag's stance shifts, reconfiguring the immediate conflict into a fragile alliance, and the cost is the exposure of Lysander's plan and the uncertain future for both.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. Orientation is immediate, and the plot progresses with clear because/therefore logic from setup to a powerful closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, where Kael becomes the pattern he sought to understand, is a decisive change with an absolute, on-page cost, perfectly satisfying the rubric's highest standards for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure. The narrative drive, a hybrid of causal action and accumulative texture, is perfectly controlled. The power outage serves as an ideal situational complication that forces the internal turn, and the final image of the poem as a "coordinate" provides a resonant and earned "after" state, fulfilling the closure requirement with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Causal lens is strong and well-executed; the duel's geometry directly causes the resolution. The closure is a clean Decisive Change that lands with cost. A minor flaw is the introduction of the sundial as the final key; though plausible, its appearance only at the moment of resolution feels convenient, slightly weakening the otherwise impeccable causality of the duel itself being the complete key.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain under a Causal lens, culminating in a well-executed moment of Charged Poise. However, the plot's primary turn relies on a significant coincidence: Elara having the plot-critical coffee tin for years without discovering its secret. While coincidence can complicate, here it functions as the enabling device for the entire second act, which is a structural weakness for a story at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean and satisfying Causal lens from problem to resolution, and the closure provides both a Decisive Change (systems fixed) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the clock). However, the resolution lacks a tangible cost. Elara achieves a pure victory without any sacrifice, trade-off, or lingering consequence, which lessens the impact of her defiance against "a predetermined course" and prevents the closure from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens. The pressure of the monsoon creates a clear timeline, and the failure of Elara's instruments necessitates a different approach. While the dream-revelation is a slightly convenient plot device, the story frames it as an interaction with the island's living memory, integrating it into the world's logic. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear conceptual cost: the surrender of a purely empirical worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the length, moving from a state of unrest to a central meditative trial and culminating in a clear resolution. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the protagonist’s internal state is altered with the felt cost of confronting his sorrow directly on the page.

    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned memory fragments and image shifts, with causal ellipsis from vision to viaduct search motivating the closure's resonant reconfiguration as Elara channels the love, reweighting her stance with emotional cost in the weeping moment. Orientation anchors early on the viaduct with the memory surfacing, serving the foggy lucidity tone without disorientation debt. A meaningful deepening occurs when the drawing shifts to the temple, tightening knowledge toward the gleaming point. Minor slip in how the mantra emerges feels slightly unmotivated, but it doesn't touch closure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Causal lens, the structure features strong because/therefore linkages, from trowel strike to vision to geometric analysis, leading to a Decisive Change closure where Elara unbends time and retrieves her mother with a felt cost in the unraveling loop and disintegrating photos. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (living bridge garden), and when (present restoration project) by the first paragraph, with deliberate temporal disorientation in the vision paying off at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs via the halo fragment's activation, narrowing options to recalculating space. No causality breaks, though the mother's sudden appearance feels elliptically motivated but earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through tight because/therefore linkages, from decoding the arrow to sealing the vault, with orientation anchored early in the abandoned carnival; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as the Liberator traps himself, foreclosing freedom to save the seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision and density increase toward closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing where the betrayal's sound reweights Elara's obsession with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by ~100 words, with single POV and one continuous scene fitting defaults. One meaningful deepening at the memory imprint tightens pressure effectively, though backstory integration borders on BRR ceiling without flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Causal lens, the structure features because/therefore linkages from planning via flower codes to theft and escape, with orientation anchored early in Elara's specialty and the gallery setting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the Charged Poise of her luminous disbelief after the leap, with visible cost in the jarring thud and heart-in-throat risk. One meaningful tightening occurs when the constable's boot compromises her route, narrowing options without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under the Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive the plot from betrayal to decryption to the dive, with motivated ellipsis in time jumps that narrow options; orientation anchors early in the rusted library under stars. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost in the surfacing gasp and weep, pointing to the clutched case as an anchor to his new self. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though minor redundancy in whisper motifs slightly softens propulsion without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered silences to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the flaking gold leaf completes the map, reweighting the endless night as a navigable journey with conceptual cost of embracing stillness. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (tower in ridge fort), and when (post-storm hush with one star) by ~50 words, serving the lyric buildup. One meaningful deepening occurs as the hush demands recording, tightening toward the flake's landing as a pattern break. No causality breaks, but the closure's cost feels more implied than visceral in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through looped variations toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where timelines converge, reweighting the robot's existence with undeniable conceptual cost in the silent amalgamation.

    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: regrets losing "punishing edge" while compass becomes "artifact" shows undeniable emotional cost; Accumulative lens holds through pole-by-pole reweighting of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: "fragile" empathy kindled through action, not memory, foreclosing avoidance. Accumulative lens holds as atmospheric density (labyrinth/lake) reweights "integration" stake. Cost legible in "space, and she had just begun to fill it."

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is flawless Decisive Change with legible cost ("he was remade") under Causal lens. Rift creation → intervention → timeline splintering forms unbroken because/therefore chain to earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: weight lifting with hope reconfigures stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost ("felt that weight begin to lift") is legible on-page. Orientation solid by word 100; lens clarity strengthens through "stitch the tapestry" accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the sand realization, but cost remains conceptual ("destitute of coin but rich") without visceral on-page manifestation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the "quiet coalescence" lacks the felt physical cost demanded by the rubric’s cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in Vorlag’s softening expression; Accumulative lens holds via resonant frequency escalation without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: blackout's cost (identity shift) crystallizes options in final image. Power outage tightens pressure meaningfully; cost proof evident in "scars were a topography of resistance" reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: the competitive tension transforms into partnership, crystallized when they approach the pane together. The lens (Causal/Accumulative Hybrid) holds perfectly through the geometric payoff, with the mechanical arm's precision enabling the decisive angle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Silas's molt becoming evolution, not escape. Final image crystallizes stakes with "luminous fracture mended... with trust." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly through moon-to-dawn cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with clock’s micro-movement as conceptual cost, but lens ambiguity at midpoint (Accumulative vs Causal) risks coherence without explicit signal.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (ridge's eternal bloom holding memory) with conceptual cost (empiricism's failure), but dream origin lacks full causal anchoring under Accumulative/Textural lens dominant at end.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the compass stilling and "cerulean regret faded to soft hue of peace" reconfigures options through accumulated sensory pressure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; "pale, luminous grey" image crystallizes the emotional trade-off.
