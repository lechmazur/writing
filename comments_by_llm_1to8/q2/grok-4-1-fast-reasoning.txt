  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the first few paragraphs (Elena, greenhouse, post-flood). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the published findings and return to the greenhouse, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no specific professional or personal opportunity is visibly foreclosed. The causal chain from dust observation to spectrometer rig to publication is summarized in compressed transit rather than dramatized through resistant material or failure, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climactic turn. The final image—"reality preprocesses into peace"—reprises the dust metaphor but remains abstract, lacking a concrete sensory anchor that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story signals who/where/when by the opening lines. A Decisive Change occurs (Elara transforms the ledger into art and becomes "canyon's guardian"), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page; no prior path is visibly foreclosed. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pauses, frost patterns, luminous motifs recur), yet the closure lacks a cadence shift or density break that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure. The ledger's secondary discovery and the confrontation occur off-stage or in summary, weakening causal linkage at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately in the opening lines. Causal linkage is thin: Elara's tuning-fork plan unfolds without obstacle until Kai's eruption, which she resolves via a fork choice with no prior setup of his brother's drowning or the glacial lily's fragility. The closure unit—"rectifying the conservatory's hush into a tangible chorus of souls"—is a thematic declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final image (smiling, "her work just begun") offers poise without consequence or foreclosed option. Cost is asserted ("once stormy seas of loss, now serene waves of creation") but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through intensifying distress signals and Elias's iterative placement of prisms in impossible spaces until the final convergence creates silence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise/transformation): Elias becomes the eternal beacon, his weariness lifted and merged with light, granting the library silence and the dead their permanent address. The cost is legible in the final image (he occupies "rest, addressed forever in the deep," his body pulled into the glow). Orientation is swift (underwater city library, undertaker, package arrival). One substantive tightening occurs as prism placement silences echoes and the lattice converges, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative lens: repeated midnight runs and the bell's toll stitch the community into a covenant. Orientation anchors (arbor, ridge, sanctions period) arrive early. The closure—Lena ringing the bell years later, declaring the tradition anew—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that shows endurance across generations. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("sanctions raged on," "unbreakable") rather than concretely dramatized; we don't see a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that the final image reweights with undeniable pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately early (viaduct, twilight, Elias). A single escalation occurs when Elias discovers Mira and applies the camera obscura, constituting one meaningful tightening. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's realization reweights his quest), yet the cost is conceptual and told rather than visible on the page in a specific forfeiture or physical consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of sparks, past-life memory, camera technique converging), but the final image does not impose undeniable pressure—Mira's healing is achieved, fog lifts, and Elias departs clarified without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but causality fractures: Elias "knows instinctively" the fragment holds the key without prior setup, and the method—tracing hyperbolic paths with the fragment—appears suddenly as both discovery and solution without intermediate failure or narrowing. The retrocognitive trap is declared ("ensnared by visions") but never dramatizes a choice it prevents; his final action (rotating the fragment through pseudospherical helices) lacks motivated escalation—he simply performs the climactic gesture without an on-page turn that forces or costs him this attempt. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (freedom from trap), yet the "chains snapped" moment lacks visible cost: the photographs crumble, but we never see Elias wrestle with losing them or choose between trap and wife's memory. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and concept), but the final image does not reweight prior material through cadence shift or pattern break—it declares release without charging the price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story provides spatial anchors (carnival prize center, Wall, vault) by the opening and maintains causal sequence through Elara's discovery and escape. However, the closure—Elara slipping through the fray with seeds—reads as mere transit rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final image ("she would plant resilience") is future-tense promise rather than an on-page forfeiture or reweighting. Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative decorative layering. The Wall's fall and her escape feel coincidentally timed rather than causally interdependent.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Elias collects absences → forges them into a hearing aid → imprints betrayal's sound → achieves closure. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening (sunken greenhouse, bioluminescent orchard, shipwrecks) and the dominant stake (capturing trust's fracture) is signaled early. However, the escalation is largely procedural—each step follows inevitably without meaningful resistance or reversal. The closure lands on the page (he dons the device, hears the sound, gains mastery) with emotional cost implied through tears and memory crystallization, but the felt price remains abstract rather than a legible forfeiture of options or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("No longer just stealing light, she wielded it"), but the change hinges on the jar's magic properties introduced late rather than protagonist agency; the cost is declared ("destiny's door swung wide") rather than dramatized. The causal chain from bouquet-code to portrait to moonbeam jar reads as convenient revelation rather than pressure-driven escalation under a stable lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story provides orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines. However, no meaningful escalation occurs under any identifiable lens—Elias arrives, lights a furnace, blows glass spheres, and declares success without obstacle, reversal, or narrowing of options. The ending presents completion rather than closure with cost: five spheres gleam and Elias laughs, but no prior stake was tested or path foreclosed. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout; the piece reads as a static tableau rather than a causal or accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: the library setting doesn't anchor clearly until paragraph 7, and the "who" remains murky through heavy exposition. The closure attempt fractures into three abandoned versions within the final paragraphs ("No—word count overrun," "Actually," "But precisely"), breaking causality and leaving no clean decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—Harlan's defeat reads as authorial convenience rather than earned outcome. The seashell's "whispering" mechanics are asserted without prior establishment, violating world rules. The "transformative betrayal" occurs entirely off-page in backstory, robbing the present action of causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (taught by the repeated "ambered hush" and marbled metaphors, held through closure). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The map-drawing sequence accumulates sensory fragments (gusts, stone settling) but the closure—Elara "clutches the map fragment, renewed"—delivers no visible or felt cost; renewal is declared, not dramatized. The final "pact against the night" remains abstract; the piece does not show what Elara or the oracle forfeit or risk to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens with looped timelines building toward a final revelation, and the closure moment ("thoughts arose...from the interstitial spaces between actions") lands as a Conceptual Repricing. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or capability is visibly altered by this insight. The orientation is anchored early (courtyard, twilight, robot janitor). The loop structure is taught through numbered cycles, but the because/therefore linkage between playing the violin and accessing each loop layer is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening causal pressure within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elias is, where exactly the forecourt sits, and the nature of the crystals remain vague past the opening third. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (mistrust thawed by honesty), but the cost is asserted ("ledger closing forever on solitude") rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or trade-off appears in the final beats. Causality is weak: the tickets and lens appear suddenly from Elias's drawer, and Mira's transformation unfolds through passive observation of projections rather than a decision that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (garden maze, Elias, post-Reckoning world). The piece operates under a hybrid lens—causal in the middle (ritual → scanner jump) and accumulative/textural at closure (the final polish and blooming paths). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias returns to his work, the maze uniformly blooms, and the council retreats. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page; the garden simply validates him. The "mended deception" speech feels like an explain-everything coda that tells the theme rather than letting the image hold it, weakening the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. A single on-page turn exists when Elara activates the nexus, generating the "subdued awakenings" effect. However, cost is asserted rather than dramatized: Lirren's childhood storm and the specimens' visions are told, not shown altering options. The closure reads as a thematic claim ("time's sideways dance") without a legible before/after in stakes or agency. The final meta-corrections ("Wait, trim to fit… No, recalibrate…") introduce scaffold noise that fractures the ending frame.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes "who/where/when" adequately by the opening beat. The closure unit—retrieving the score and exiting the flooded house—reads as a Decisive Change with felt cost (the house groans, lanterns extinguish, alarms wail), but the causal chain from discovering the program to slashing the lantern to flooding the compartment feels opportunistic rather than driven by prior pressure. The inferred lens is Causal, yet key turns (the grate, the waterproof case) appear without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates auroral imagery and oracle motifs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts the burden. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat. The closure lands—she accepts carrying the weight—but the cartographer's fate arrives as told backstory rather than on-page event, diluting the cost proof. The pattern holds, yet the decisive moment lacks immediate visible consequence, keeping it mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors by line four (tunnel beneath mill, explorer, night). The closure unit—Jax turning the wheel and releasing remorse—is on the page, but causality wobbles: the radio confession being his own anonymous call, compelled by the wheel's touch, is a retroactive patch that undermines earned escalation. The "drowsy haze" mechanism and "psychic residue" toggle between causal and metaphorical without teaching the reader which lens to hold. One meaningful turn (radio confession → wheel turn) is present, but the cost (beads snapping, truth expelled) is gestured at rather than dramatized with visible consequence that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (swan, folds, silence, crumbling peace) toward a final tableau. Orientation anchors appear late: the keeper's identity, the library's nature, and his purpose emerge gradually across the first third without spatial grounding. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing—the obsidian refuge reweights "crumbling peace" as regenerative rather than decay—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or constraint charges the final image. Escalation is elided: the "drift of untold days" compresses the burrowing into summary, and the refuge simply "parts" without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, Lila, Sage Ridge, eclipse timing) arrive within the first ~120 words, meeting the test. The closure unit—Lila touching the curl, whispering "It feels... alive," and exploring the roots—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is more asserted than demonstrated: we're told she smiles and hums, yet the story doesn't show what she's relinquishing or risking by accepting the locket. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (eclipse + harp + locket + roots build toward a moment of reweighting), but the final image recycles prior language ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance," "dreaming roots") without charging it with fresh pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (locket reveal during totality), satisfying the 600–800 word threshold, but the epilogue descent dilutes the closure beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late and remain vague—"bronze quiet," "reclaimed silo library," and "after the last human dream" are atmospheric but imprecise past ~120 words. The closure offers thematic repricing ("a dreamless man dreaming through stone") but no visible cost or foreclosed path; Thorne ends where he began, listening to walls. The displaced axis and dragon mythology accumulate density but do not tighten options or produce a decisive change. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors emerge clearly, but the causal chain from discovery to execution is telescoped. Elias finds the microdot specs, immediately conceives a plan, bakes new cookies, manipulates the lighthouse beam, and the spies are caught—all in a single night with no visible friction or failure that tests his commitment. The closure (spies arrested, Elias celebrated) reads as Decisive Change on the surface, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; locals cheer and the wind "whispers approval," erasing any shadow or trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, but key links are summarized rather than dramatized, and coincidence (spies arriving exactly when needed, authorities immediately responding) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure where the shadow's "hidden assumptions" are exposed, but the actual cost or consequence remains abstract—no concrete before/after in Elias's options, the anchor's physical state, or dimensional stability is legible on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the dimensional anchor's nature and Elias's role emerge gradually through dense description rather than early grounding, delaying comprehension past the 120-word mark. Causality is present but loose: the loop pedal's mechanics and the shadow's defeat hinge on rhetorical repetition without clear physical or metaphysical rules governing why loops constrain possession. The ending declares victory ("possession thwarted," "assumptions forever exposed") without showing a tangible transformation or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece opens with severe orientation debt: who Elara is, where the spire stands, and what stakes are live remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty and the Q3=7.0 cap. The closure—Elara collapsing after conducting her symphony—delivers a status change (homesick → fulfilled), but the cost is asserted exhaustion rather than a visible forfeiture or tradeoff legible in the final image. Under an Accumulative lens (the piece layers memory-mapping and dawn imagery), the ending reconfigures her fortune-writing, yet the causal chain from shell-mapping to symphonic realization lacks because/therefore linkage; coincidence (dawn's timing, the materialized crowd) resolves rather than complicates. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual proceeds without a reversal or narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, causality is decorative: Elias activates runes, timelines appear, he floats through them, absorbs his shadow, and the labyrinth collapses—each beat follows "and then" rather than "because." The closure unit (absorbing the doppelganger) occurs without prior dramatized cost or a legible tradeoff; the phrase "integrated the fracture" tells the resolution instead of showing a decisive change. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the quest structure), the linkage fails; under Accumulative, no pattern-break or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals a dominant stake (defeating numbness) and reaches a closure moment (Elara's numbness flees through the act of enthralling others), but the cost is implied rather than visible on the page—no line shows what Elara forfeits or what path is now foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (filament of hush, backward songs, mirrored silence), yet the final paragraph summarizes the outcome ("numbness fled, defeated") instead of charging the closure image with a felt price. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (cavern, Elara, present tense of teaching).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the courtyard arrival. The closure—encoding her intuition and choosing solitude over reporting—qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost (withholding potentially critical intelligence) is asserted rather than dramatically felt on the page. The Causal lens holds through the pigeon arrival and lateral deduction sequence, though the follower's identity and the "zone-touched scout" conclusion arrive via summary rather than on-page dramatization. One meaningful tightening occurs when she connects the breach to weaponized pigeons, but the final stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Orientation Test is marginal: "energy beings," "terra-cotta grotto," and "Elias" anchor within ~120 words, but the connection between prison escape and time-texture quest remains hazy until mid-story. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the closure unit—Elias wrapping the rope and declaring "not sever, but integrate"—lacks visible cost; the beings simply "envelop him in light" and he emerges "transformed" without forfeiting agency, relationship, or opportunity on the page. The "impossible choice" dissolves into a conceptual loophole rather than a decision with felt consequence. A micro turn (the third layer unveiling) exists, but escalation under the Accumulative lens demands a cadence shift or cost that reweights the stake—here the final image asserts transformation without dramatizing its price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by the greenhouse paragraph and accumulates pressure through the bonfire ritual, weaving fragments into a communal unbinding. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Lir continues his mendicant rounds with the hush softened but enduring, and the apple bud trembling offers a charged image. Cost is present but oblique: the chronic hush "cracked" yet remains, survivors carry echoes home, and Lir's bowl is "light" (empty), suggesting depletion or completion. The lens holds, but the cost could be more viscerally legible in the final lines to anchor the reconfiguration with undeniable felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation (who, where, when) arrives cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the blotter petal appears in multiple beats, static electricity recurs, and the final image ("carrying the blotter petal's secret charge into the night") reweights prior material. However, the closure effect—Mira's transformation sealed, Elias unchanged—lacks visible cost; her smile and his fond removal land without forfeiting a live option or redefining his stance. One meaningful deepening (the petal absorbs her sorrow) occurs, but the ending asserts stasis rather than making cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (friendship formalized, cycle acknowledged) with a felt emotional cost (Mira's reclusiveness broken, Elias's solitude ended), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the causal chain is weak: the mistaken address is pure coincidence, and the locket's backstory is delivered through exposition rather than discovered beats. The orientation anchor is delayed—"breezy library under stars" appears in line two, but we don't learn Elias's precise location or the concert context until well past the 120-word mark, warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece orients who/where/when by ~120 words (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, beyond lost languages), avoiding the orientation penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the shared search and communal web-building. However, the closure—Elara placing the final knot and declaring "we dedicate this work to our shared becoming"—lands as a ceremony rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The arbor's discovery and the sculpture's completion feel like fulfillment of a quest rather than a reconfiguration that reweights prior loneliness. Cost is asserted ("no longer adrift") but not legibly paid on the page; the ache is "transformed" and "shared," yet no specific price (time, isolation, artistic autonomy) is dramatized in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens (giant's nap → time pressure, pendant borrows time → sculptures soften) and arrives at an on-page closure when Elara completes her grand opus. However, the cost is abstract—"pendant cooling" and sealing a book—rather than a visible forfeiture of nap-time or tactical consequence. The sculptures' resistance dissolves without dramatized friction, and the Cradle reveal feels like arrival rather than a turn that reweights prior stakes. Closure exists but the cost remains conceptual and underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: poetic density and recurrence aim to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (Thorne, cavern orchard, moonlit night) arrive early enough. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Thorne gains partial understanding and "buried optimism"—but cost remains asserted ("no full restoration came") rather than visibly forecloses a choice or alters tactics on the page. The final image ("cavern orchard...held its breath") is atmospheric but does not demonstrate a before/after pivot with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors orientation early (library, dawn, outage) and follows a clean causal chain: sob heard → cache prepared → tape discovered → woman finds cache → Elias reveals himself. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps from shadow into her beam, fulfilling his vow with visible cost (years of hiding now foreclosed). The tape's emergence feels coincidental rather than causally earned, introducing mild convenience, but the final image reweights his isolation with undeniable pressure and the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (nursery owner, storm season, trellis) appear early. The story follows a causal chain: leaf discovery → tea brewing → metamorphosis → rooted completion. However, the closure—Elias fully transformed, thriving as plant-man—presents a Decisive Change without legible cost on the page; the final paragraphs ("nursery flourished," "harmony bloomed") assert success rather than showing what was lost or foreclosed. The phrase "This study... eternal now" gestures toward acceptance but does not dramatize the price of abandoning humanity, violating the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rain trails, tidal rhythms, and war-scarred setting build density toward a final reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the brooch installed on the easel crystallizes purpose and the convergence of past/present—but the cost remains largely asserted ("purpose") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative. Orientation anchors land clearly by the opening paragraph. The rain-to-pool sequence provides one meaningful tightening, sufficient for this length, though Mira's arrival introduces coincidence that complicates without fully resolving under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens: accumulative/lyric with causal aspirations that do not fully cohere. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (no penalty). The piece attempts closure via Elara's possession and the pearl transfer, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or changed tactic on the page, only assertion ("the unseen forces' gift unfolding steadily unpredictably"). The pearl's discovery feels coincidental and the forces' arrival unmotivated within prior causality. Closure form (Resonant Reconfiguration / Charged Poise) is gestured at but not earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elias at Ivory Harbor post-exile). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: three trumpet intervals build density and reweight the stake from grief to hope. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("absences were bridges, not breaks"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift grounds the transformation. The crowd disperses "heartened" without a visible price paid by Elias or the community, leaving the closure effect conceptually neat but emotionally inert.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal initially (punch enables passage, arrows guide movement) but collapses into Accumulative decoration by the ending, where motifs recur without reweighting stakes or meaning. Orientation is late: who Elias is beyond "route mapper" and what "unspoken truths" concretely mean remain vague past the opening third. The closure unit—"he had found not just secrets, but the map to his own unspoken heart"—is a thematic assertion rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the return ticket and "unshaken certainty" erase any price. No meaningful tightening of options occurs; each obstacle (grate, bricks, gates) dissolves on contact without forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (tower, cliffs, whale migration) promptly and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: memories unlock, transcription accumulates, visitors arrive. However, the closure lacks a decisive reweighting with visible cost—Elara moves from skeptic to believer off-page between paragraphs ("Elara's skepticism cracked"), and the final image ("gratitude, release, wonder") summarizes emotional states rather than landing a charged moment. The tile's unlocking of memories reads as convenient coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, and no persistent constraint shapes the final transcription choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "prismatic escondite" and "dimensional veil" are never anchored spatially or temporally. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern, nor situational crystallization is taught early or held at closure. The ending dissolves into abstract claims ("after goodbye waits not nothing, but thunder hushed into symphonies") without on-page cost or visible change in options. Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (prep room, Eli, Victor's body). The drive lens reads Causal with clear because/therefore: Victor's death → Eli searches body → finds ink pot → vapor changes thinking → equations resolve → breach succeeds. One meaningful tightening occurs (the 247-second patrol calculation narrows the window), and the breach is a Decisive Change with visible cost (fleeing into night, declaring asylum). However, the cost at closure feels muted—no on-page consequence of the breach itself, only Eli "racing to declare asylum" off-page. The vapor's mechanism (liquefies rigid thinking) enabling the solution lands quickly without friction, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story orients who, where, and when within the opening paragraphs, satisfying the Orientation Test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Thorne's ritual deepens through layered refractions until the lamp's "tremor" forces him to confront the town's silence, culminating in the act of binding and releasing the notepad. However, the closure effect—figures emerging from frost—occurs entirely off-stage and is told in summary ("Figures emerged from frost, blinking into light"). The cost is implied but not dramatized: we do not see Thorne forfeit his isolation, his workshop, or his method in a visible on-page action. The final image of him watching from the pavilion with "notebook spent" gestures toward renunciation but does not land a decisive change or crystallize a choice with felt pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (layered fragments → final reweighting) but the closure unit is diffuse: the poison-label discovery and identity-reclamation occur in rapid summary rather than a single charged image with legible cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge slowly across the first third without teaching disorientation as a pattern, yet the delay does not decisively harm the ending. The tidal rhythm provides structure, but causality remains loose—fragments accumulate without narrowing options until the abrupt convergence in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening is present (label discovery → memory unlock), meeting minimum escalation for this length, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when promptly and teaches an accumulative-textural pattern: Elias unpacks the cello, shell hums summon reimagined voices, fragments coalesce into the riddle's answer. The closure—"I am the arrow that flies true only in flight"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is told ("myths busted anew, yet cherished") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The hums and voices function as atmosphere rather than causal agents that narrow Elias's tactics, blurring whether discovery or performance drives the turn. Orientation is clean; the lens holds, but the final image's weight rests on assertion more than felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors appear quickly (raft city, carnival, Elara's role), satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elara's graffiti plan unfolds in sequence, and the privatization threat provides situational pressure. However, the closure unit is weak—"Elara painted on" and "She absorbed it all" are assertions without a decisive on-page change or visible cost. The story claims victory ("reorganization had saved the spirit") via summary rather than dramatizing a final turn that reweights options. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows what Elara lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening lines and maintains causal coherence: oxygen depletion → timed chemical signals → rescue arrival. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias outlasts and captures the image), but the cost is primarily circumstantial (low oxygen, waiting for rescue) rather than a decisive trade-off that forecloses a path. The discovered micro-etchings at base feel like an add-on rather than reweighting prior material. Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture; it holds but doesn't deepen meaningfully at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure reads as successful repair → serene vigil; no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing is legible. The anchor-chain timeframe brackets the repair sequence but does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off at the ending. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early; causality (drone damaged → refraction exam → patch → test) holds within the repair. The inferred lens is Causal (because/therefore), but the ending resets Elias to pre-story stasis without felt cost or altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative lens: falcon vellum + phrasebook translation + condensation pattern converge to validate the quest. Orientation is anchored early (outpost, frozen lake, Harlan). However, closure lacks felt cost; Harlan simply departs with "the thrill" and a wry salute—no on-page price paid, no path foreclosed, no meaningful tightening that narrows options. The ending crystallizes intent but does not reconfigure stakes or deliver a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph (waiving Orientation debt), but causality is weak: Elias's actions (striking the fork, pacing) trigger rebuilding through unmotivated magic with no resistance, failure, or discovery. The ending delivers a Decisive Change (town revived, ghosts solidified), yet the cost is invisible—Elias simply "vanished into the wild dawn" with no forfeited option, visible sacrifice, or reweighted stance. The narrative reads as and-then sequencing under a vague Accumulative lens that never meaningfully tightens or deepens; the fork's mechanics are asserted rather than discovered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately early (underwater temple, oxygen running low, distress signal sent). Causality is present but leans on convenience: the perfume vial's scent arrives precisely when needed to override panic, and its memory-unlocking power functions as an emotional master key without prior setup or trade-off. The closure—Lirael surfaces with the orb, "forever changed"—lands as Charged Poise (options crystallized, rescue imminent, hush claimed), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or bodily toll. Under a Causal lens the vial's problem-solving role weakens linkage; under Accumulative/Textural the final image reweights prior loneliness into "splendor," which is asserted more than it reconfigures on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (copperlight/hush/hovering motifs layer toward a final resonance). Orientation anchors arrive within ~120 words (lighthouse prison, Elias, father's legacy). The closure—releasing the father's shade into the void, threading the labyrinth complete—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush is achieved, the narrative etched), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: "bodies still secret" tells us discovery looms, yet no on-page moment makes us feel the forfeiture or consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (deeper into the labyrinth, shades coalesce, lattice pulses), satisfying the length default, but the accumulative payoff lacks a final image that reweights prior pressure with undeniable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (bead, veil, venom, fields) accumulate toward a lyric closure. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and why he's alone emerges gradually but the greenhouse anchor holds by ~15%. Fatal flaw: no on-page cost at closure. Elias "collapses," his "spirit resonated, freed"—this is told transcendence, not a Decisive Change with visible price or a Charged Poise that crystallizes options. The bead rolls free "inert," but what path was foreclosed? What did he give up or endure that we see? Closure unit is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where the village sits relative to the canyon, and when "tonight" occurs remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—Elara's tapestry reborn and villagers ascending—occurs off-stage during sleep and is summarized at dawn without on-page causal cost or a visible price paid. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric-accumulative gestures coexist with a summary causal claim) and not held cleanly through the ending. Coincidence (somnolence "claims her") enables rather than complicates the resolution, violating situational and causal norms.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (satisfied). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (orchard imagery, layered excavation, gradual faith restoration through artifact discovery). However, closure lacks visible cost: the sundial is rebuilt, faith is "kindled anew," but no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The ending delivers thematic echo ("testament to purposeful wandering's quiet power") instead of a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Causality is linear (arrival → dig → discovery → rebuild → resolution) but escalation is absent; each artifact deepens theme without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (chalk code → letter → mailing). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Charged Poise—Elara rises with the letter, code woven, secrets ready to fly—but the cost remains abstract ("nestled in the margins, untouched by the digital storm") rather than a visible forfeiture or consequence that changes her options. The escalation (urgency declared, code drawn, envelope sealed) tightens chronologically but does not narrow a live choice or force a trade-off that lands with felt price at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: layers of stitching, flame observation, and chart completion build toward the courier moment. However, the closure—chart delivered, coup "poised to thwart"—occurs off-page in future consequence rather than landing as an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. The final image ("candle burned eternal, witness to her quiet triumph") asserts triumph without dramatizing the cost or stakes shift that would qualify as Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spirits' songs, unsent letters, and condensation motifs layer toward a final reunion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure—Thorne's appearance and mutual embrace—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "wounds sealed" and "love fierce and whole" declare resolution without showing what Elara forfeited or what live option she foreclosed. The shard's healing and the spirits' cooperative weaving make the reunion feel granted rather than earned through a decision that narrows her world.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN early and accumulates pressure through the decryption beats, reaching closure when Elara unknots the string and whispers her vow. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting shared anxieties into tentative peace. Cost is implied ("their anxieties no longer solitary knots") but the exact sacrifice or foreclosed path remains abstract—no visible trade-off on the page weakens the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece operates in accumulative/textural mode but lacks a decisive cost at closure. Elara lifts the fragment, paints with light, and the fog retreats—all moves that compound but never narrow options or impose sacrifice. The "daydream" frame is invoked repeatedly but never dramatized as a constraint or cost; orientation within that frame remains vague past the 120-word mark (who else is present? what stakes anchor her here?). The ending offers mood and imagery but no legible before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a form of Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena's transformation from skeptic to apprentice—but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than dramatized. The "pause between question and reply" creates time dilation, yet no prior constraint makes this ellipsis feel necessary; the reader cannot trace what Elias risked or lost by performing the bewitchment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (nested layers, sonic imagery), but the final beat—"Certainty traded for wonder, the garden's magic etched eternally in nested echoes"—is a thematic declaration rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when remain vague through the first third; "shadowed year of 2147," "the sprawl," and "back-alley markets" float without spatial anchors (apply −0.4, cap Q3 at 7.0). Drive lens ambiguous—rushes through what feel like causal beats without dramatization, then shifts to accumulative pattern-planting, then a situational convergence, never teaching one pattern or holding it to closure (apply −0.5, cap Q2 at 7.2 and all others at 8.0). Closure unit unclear: the greenhouse "pulses," patterns "spread," but no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with legible cost lands on the page; the ending asserts "defiance stood guard" without demonstrating what was foreclosed or won.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes spatial anchors (gargantuan shell, chambers) and a lyric-accumulative lens by the first third, but the closure unit—sleep claimed after ensconcing the postcard—lacks on-page cost or a decisive change in options. The final image ("Elowen dreamed on") asserts resolution rather than dramatizing it; no prior choice meaningfully narrows tactics or forecloses a path. Escalation reads as rhetorical intensification (stacking metaphors, repeating "centuries," "shyly unstoppable") rather than because/therefore linkage or pattern break that reweights the stake. The repetitive final third dilutes momentum and signals unearned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves through four museum wings in sequence, repeating the ritual (tube sings → light blooms → orchids capture names) with minor variation in each wing's extinct feeling. The pattern is taught by the second wing, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs mid-story; each wing functions identically until the tube shatters in the fourth. The closure image (Elara kneeling, names preserved, tube destroyed) offers a Conceptual Repricing—the museum is "no longer wholly deserted"—but the cost is ambiguous: she achieves her goal and the tube's destruction feels like natural exhaustion rather than a sacrifice or trade-off that forecloses a path. Orientation is clear (opal library, Elara, glass orchids) within the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The escalation curve is flat until the final wing, then resolves via external event (tube shatters) rather than protagonist agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when promptly and follows a causal chain: Elara uses the ink well to unsnarl the scroll, which produces symphonies revealing her motives, leading to Thorne's acceptance. However, the closure is softened by convenient magic that solves the trust fracture without visible cost to Elara—she succeeds, gains trust, keeps the ink, and both paths remain open. The "symphonies of truth" function as a validation device rather than a choice that forecloses an option or exacts a felt price. Inferred lens: Causal with light Accumulative touches; closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration but cost remains conceptual rather than on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens through Elias's discovery and analysis of the envelope, but the escalation feels mechanical: he finds, decodes, realizes, and implements without meaningful resistance. Orientation anchors "who" and "where" within bounds, though the volcanic amphitheater's spatial logic remains hazy. Closure arrives on the page as Elias's redesigned system succeeds and clans align, but the cost—"machinist's vigilance harmonizing flux"—is asserted in abstract language rather than made viscerally felt. The "building breathes" refrain becomes a structural crutch rather than a pressure device.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (dust-mapping recurs, pigeons ferry notes, chip hums), but the closure—Elias dies peacefully, Lila carries on—lacks visible cost or decisive reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed: we learn "vintage bookshop attic" and pigeons early, but Elias's present goal (amplify chip, preserve songs) emerges only after extended backstory. The betrayal/fraud/confession arc is summarized in rapid blocks rather than dramatized turns, weakening causal linkage. No on-page cost forecloses a path at the ending; the "faint smile" and Lila's pigeon-training are asserted without showing what was lost or reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words ("drifting prism terrace," "after the butterfly effect" as abstract frame). The causal chain—grain analysis → logbook discovery → compass unlock → reunion—reads as convenience plotting; the compass emerges late to solve a problem it did not help create. Closure lacks visible cost: Elowen crosses the threshold and finds father waiting with no on-page sacrifice, forfeiture, or trade-off that alters options. The ending asserts "fractured no more, yet ever hushed" without a legible before/after change in stakes or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts accumulative/textural design but struggles with causality: the feather's arrival feels arbitrary, its interpretive power unearned, and the firefly swarm's appearance is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist action. The closure moment—"belonging's rhythm was this luminous respite, exhaled together"—reads as thematic summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive slowly across the opening, and the midpoint lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara in the geode cave, investigating memory paths), satisfying orientation. Causality is present but thin: the bird arrives, drops seeds into the crater glass, emotions script themselves, and Elara concludes—each step follows but without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (paths as seeds requiring fertile soil) that reframes the premise, but the final image ("tucked a seed into her palm, ready to scatter") asserts future action rather than landing a felt present cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the piece builds atmosphere and recurrent motifs, yet the ending reweights meaning primarily through telling ("she had uncovered the why") instead of a charged image that demonstrates cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (tidal arcade, Jasper between acts). The lens reads as Situational-Causal hybrid: Jasper arranges circumstances, but the closure—two strangers connecting over chess pieces—lands through coincidence that Jasper merely watches, not a decision he makes that forecloses options. Cost is conceptual (his invisibility as orchestrator) but not felt on the page in a way that alters his stance. The bishop's trajectory is over-engineered ("factoring sea breeze velocity, crowd density") in a way that strains credibility, and the ending grants Elara and the stranger a shared plan without on-page friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story opens with vague temporal-conceptual anchors ("after the nostalgia ban had crumbled") and withholds who Elara is, where the garden sits, or what "tide dancer" means past ~200 words; orientation debt applies (−0.4). A Decisive Change occurs—Elara completes the verse and bonds with Kai—but the causal chain is stitched by coincidence: the moonstone speck spontaneously anchors her, then spontaneously releases when she observes star-gaps, with no earned link between observation and physical effect. The closure moment itself (inscribing Kai's arm) lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; exile is "complete" by fiat, not foreclosed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is unclear: who Elias is beyond occupation, where exactly he stands in the opening, and when "before everything shifts" occurs remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure—Elias climbing back with "renewed resolve"—lacks visible cost or a decisive reconfiguration; the ripple-reading delivers exposition about community rifts without altering his options on the page. The causal chain is weak: the stone-toss produces visions that he passively receives, then he simply leaves with purpose, foreclosing no path and paying no legible price. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending restates the opening premise without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: "Elias, the scarred forest firefighter" arrives at line 3, spatial grounding (ridge path, pines) is present but the forward pressure remains vague until Lena's sob ~40% through. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (celestial imagery, box handling, shared memory), but closure is a stated vow without visible cost—Lena's declaration does not foreclose a path or reweight prior material through image. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies for delayed anchoring, and the Cost Proof Test shows no exact sentence where cost is legible at closure; the final image ("binding scars to stars") is metaphor without agency. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (grotto, Elara, twilight) arrive quickly, but causality operates as illustrative sequence: she arranges patterns, balloons ascend, timelines converge, hope spreads—each step declared rather than dramatized with because/therefore pressure. The closure unit ("hope revitalized in cascading waves," "people stirred from apathy") is told in summary; no on-page moment shows a single person's stakes reweighted by her trial balloons. Cost remains abstract ("equations etched into hearts") without a visible forfeiture or stance crystallization. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, yet no cadence shift or pattern break charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough and follows a causal chain: echoes lead to passage, passage to alcove, alcove to diaries, diaries to darkroom, darkroom to revelation. The closure—Elias vowing confession and sketching atonement—lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (dismantling family legacy). However, the final beat's cost is more asserted than dramatized; "burden lightened, transmuted into duty" reads as summary rather than a visible forfeiture or act that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening is present (discovery narrows his understanding and forces a stance), satisfying the lens, but the ending could charge harder.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural (dusky harmony, prismatic imagery, coded lullabies), but no meaningful deepening or cadence shift alters stakes. Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored early, waiving penalty. Closure form is ambiguous: Elowen renews her heartbeat and dissolves "as every spring," suggesting repetition without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The ritual succeeds without friction, and the final image ("borrowed heartbeat echoing forever") offers no visible forfeiture or reweighted meaning. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what she loses or what option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The closure unit—delegates signing, Elara's blood-seal, peace blooming—reads as Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost ("what was forever lost," spectral boy) is asserted rather than made legible through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The boy's vision and Elara's palm-press occur, but no prior scene establishes what she sacrifices beyond abstract redemption. One meaningful tightening (ritual invoked, delegates approached) is present, but the final image deflates into summary ("Forever War stuttered to silence") rather than a charged particular.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives late—who Elias is and why he's on the salt flat emerge piecemeal across the first third, but the effect does not pay off at closure, applying −0.4 under the Orientation Test and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a Charged Poise / Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias places the egg and walks away as storm waters arrive, reweighting his manufactured drought with a visible ritual of absolution. Cost is felt but oblique—he cannot speak of it, and the story ends on imagined birdsong rather than a materially changed option. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (cracks as map, thunder's lull-to-roar, salt as tomb/womb), and the final storm reconfigures the flat's meaning, meeting the threshold for on-page closure with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure unit—Elara walking away "no longer bound"—asserts liberation without demonstrating a decisive change in her circumstances or options; the lullaby "falters" off-page in others' minds, not hers. Orientation is delayed: who she is and what the loom represents emerge only after dense atmospheric description, and the courtyard's function remains abstract until the middle. The causal chain is weak: untangling threads produces echoes, but how echoes "plant seeds of doubt" or alter the Empire's power is told, not shown. The ending summarizes consequence ("fracture, thread by thread") rather than landing a visible cost or reconfigured stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (dome, alone, post-argument) by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: serene reflection accumulates toward a renunciation. Closure attempts Earned Stasis (halting the shows, embracing honest campfire tales), but the cost remains told rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of income, audience, or identity that we witness him lose. The reversal (stick read backward, villain's fall) functions as metaphor without altering tactics or knowledge in the present scene. Accumulative designs require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final beats repeat "serene," "hush," "reverse" without tightening pressure or making the sacrifice undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered signal-building toward a final density), but closure lacks visible cost. The structures dissolve as designed, monarchs pass, and Elara packs—no option is foreclosed, no knowledge reweighted, no stance crystallized with felt price. "Histories honored, cadence echoing unresolved" is thematic assertion, not a Resonant Reconfiguration that the reader experiences. Orientation penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive cleanly by line 2, waiving the test.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure—voices erupting and Elara weeping—lands on the page, but the cost is decorative: her tears freeze and thaw without foreclosing a path or altering future options. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (aurora, rope, card converge in the final illumination), but the before/after is cosmetic—she arrives seeking preservation and achieves it without trade-off. Orientation is anchored early (sanctum, Elara, aurora), waiving penalties. The single meaningful tightening (threading the card into the rope) occurs, but the resolution feels like wish fulfillment rather than earned closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (Elara, bunker, storm approaching) but the causal chain fractures at the dream-pod sequence: the directive's voice supplies answers via exposition, and Elara's "transcendence" occurs passively through injected neural mist rather than protagonist action. The closure—"No longer foresight hindsight only"—registers as a conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("dream-shards," "gritty veils lifted") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or tradeoff on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern-heavy, recursive phrasing), yet the final image lacks the pressure or cadence shift required to reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is functional but late (who/where/when gel only after ~150 words). The piece moves through discovery beats (tile → charts → cipher → rift → vow) in and-then sequence without meaningful narrowing of options; Ezar encounters no impediment, so each step feels like unpacking rather than escalation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (visions granted, covenant sealed), but the cost is asserted ("devotion encrypted no longer") rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift proves the price paid. Under a hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative imagery), the ending reconfigures Ezar's role, but without visible sacrifice the effect is declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening window. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure where "resentment was the broken pin" reweights the premise, but the cost remains abstract—Thorne's "grace shifting anew" tells resolution rather than showing forfeiture or a visible tradeoff on the page. The sanctuary's reality-shifts function as atmosphere rather than causal pressure that narrows options. Causality is present but thin: Elias winds the box, vibrations trigger memories, Thorne exhales and changes—each step is motivated but the linkage lacks friction or escalation that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (ruined orchard), and when (twilight) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mirrors multiply, breaths synchronize, fog retreats, and the dream solidifies through density and pattern rather than because/therefore causality. Closure arrives on the page—"She emerged fully… Elias captured her"—but the cost is oblique: we are told "boundaries dissolved" and "recaptured world," yet no prior material is visibly foreclosed or reweighted with undeniable price. The final embrace feels declarative rather than charged by prior constraint or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraphs. The closure—Lila's realization that vows are "roots that regrow" and her decision to participate in autumn vows—lands on the page with felt relational cost (her return after breach, saved Elias from beam, ribbon retied). However, the discovered bag feels convenient; it appears exactly when needed and its contents solve the problem without prior setup that the heart-tree's quartz needed these specific items. The lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture; the final image reweights prior material, but the ease of the repair and emotional reconciliation softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode with recurring "brightened disquiet" and the cameo blank as structural motifs, but causality remains vague—Elara's choices (inquiring, engraving) feel obligatory rather than motivated by tightening pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("curator become exhibit," "live between the pages"), yet the cost is asserted in abstract language rather than shown through a forfeited path or altered tactic. The philosophical bathroom conceit recurs but does not constrain action or charge the final image with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure is entirely off-page: "They entered, the unheard symphony resolving into triumphant silence, fates realigned." The guardian's capitulation lacks causal grounding—we're told Elara presents findings but the negotiation itself vanishes into summary. Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor arrives late (~100+ words into dense fantastical description), and the spatial relationships remain vague throughout (Verdant Stacks, Fractured Folios, Whispering Warrens appear as arbitrary labels). The bracketed meta-commentary ("[Adjusting flow.] ... [Word check internal.] [Final tally: precisely woven.]") are generation scaffolding that should have been removed but signal the piece was assembled rather than composed. Drive lens appears causal but the because/therefore chain breaks at the guardian scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara collects narrative threads across the ship to open the garden archway. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive early enough. The closure—stepping through the archway with her twin—lands on the page, but the cost is abstract ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that narrows options. The method (weaving threads) connects beats, but each thread-binding feels iterative without meaningful tightening or a reversal that changes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation quickly (archivist, tower, quarterly inspection) and follows a causal chain: door appears → chamber discovered → merge performed → door fades. However, the closure suffers from cost ambiguity—"transformed by resolved complexity" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the visible price paid (unraveling rope, pressing seal) feels procedural rather than a foreclosure of options or a stance crystallization with undeniable pressure. The lens reads Causal, but the final image lacks the sharpness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the Mapkeeper reads patterns, positions the stone, and the bloom unfolds outward in layered imagery. Orientation anchors quickly (harmonic caves, after invasion, Mapkeeper descending). The closure—bloom enveloping the chamber, energy beings withdrawing—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the quiet that endures, forged in the hammer of invasion"), and the cost is legible (her eternal vigil, the fragile truce). One meaningful deepening occurs when cracks reveal the spiral node. The lens holds without contradiction, though the accretive quality leans heavily on repetition of key phrases rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with heavy abstraction ("hush of a world unraveled," "glass humming pavilion") that does not anchor who, where, when concretely until the scavenging paragraph; apply −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure—beacon ignites, wanderers will follow—is told rather than shown with visible cost; the "coincidence of winds cleared the clouds" resolves the problem via external luck, not protagonist agency. Drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid but the ending shifts to causal summary without demonstrating the felt price of rekindling or the tactical constraint star-tracking imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader learns "who" only through title-like phrasing and "where" through poetic fragments, with no clear spatial anchor by ~120 words; apply −0.4 for orientation debt. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (pattern of shadow-reading → deepening hush → crystallized insight), but no meaningful tightening occurs—each monument delivers a similar conjecture without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing ("identity was collective, forged in shared hush"), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown: no prior path is foreclosed, no tactical change forced. The fog-bridge's solidity is introduced as backdrop and its groaning departure carries no consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation arrives quickly (wandering designer, blooming fortress, dusk) and the causal lens is clear: Elias seeks the mosaic note → spins fire to filter light → discovers design → builds firework → launches. However, closure lacks felt cost; the firework succeeds without complication, villagers emerge in wonder, and Elias vows to continue—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "vow to light every dusk" reads as assertion rather than a crystallized choice shaped by prior pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived because anchors land early.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains single POV throughout. The dominant stake—Mira's need to grasp her transition—is signaled, but the closure effect is weak: she whispers "I see it now" without a visible cost or decision that forecloses a path. The jade cicada vision sequence offers a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt, but it functions as explanation rather than a choice or endurance that changes her stance on the page. The "warmly observant" lens holds, but the ending delivers insight without the felt price required for closure under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of silence-flavors and the inversion ritual build toward the gilded-hush prize. Orientation anchors (trellis, inversion hour, collection task) arrive early. The noise-weaver intrusion provides a micro-turn, and the ending image (doll brimming, descent with sky-silences) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, cost remains largely asserted ("heart soared free," "she'd counter with quiet") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice, preventing entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test barely passes (who/where/when emerge by line 10), but the causal chain is weak: Elias's method succeeds without complication, and Mira's transformation occurs through passive observation rather than her agency. The closure—silence "wiser" and Elias watching them vanish—offers no decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration; it's a soft reset that declares success without dramatizing what was risked or lost. The inferred lens (accumulative/textural) never tightens or reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~180 words, when/why remain vague until ~250); the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4), also capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—throne acceptance via "communing with its lore"—lacks visible cost; "restoration" is asserted without showing what Elara sacrifices or forecloses. Causality is Tourist Plot: she navigates obstacles (tunnels, waterfall, drones, trapdoor) in sequence without her decisions narrowing options or creating new complications. The drive lens reads Causal by default but the and-then sequencing never tightens into because/therefore linkage. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (charcoal sanctuary, after cutting contact, shadow keeper tending alone). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the ring's arrival, the linking-through-scars vision, and her encroachment, culminating in his act of heating the ring to stabilize the threshold—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where his refusal crystallizes with her first unassisted breath as felt cost. However, the mechanics of "linking through scars" and how heating the ring teaches her to breathe remain opaque, blunting causality. The closure image (ring discarded, threshold enduring, her cry carrying fresh air) lands with conceptual cost, but the because/therefore chain wobbles at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and hazy: the opening line announces "the epoch when concepts became physical" without anchoring who, where, or when concretely until several lines later, and even then the spatial layout (farm depths, core chamber, cavern) remains vague. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (spore compression → diamonds), but causality is thin—glitchy texts arrive, Elias twists a bolt, diamonds erupt—with no meaningful resistance, complication, or cost legible on the page. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (pyramid scars become jewels), yet the final image is diffuse across multiple beats without a single charged moment that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (sepia reading room, evening, Elias). However, the causal chain is weak: Elias inserts a record, hears overtones that are "encoded signals," and standing waves somehow reveal a hidden panel—this leap is asserted rather than motivated by prior clues or choice. The closure (burning documents, deciding to end the dynasty) occurs on the page, but the cost is told ("free, the ender fulfilled") rather than felt in a concrete sacrifice or foreclosed option. The drive lens reads Causal by intent but the because/therefore linkage breaks at the gramophone revelation, and the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal linkage (clasp → threads → visions) but relies on decorative intensifiers ("reality shifts peaked," "fruits quivering") that do not narrow options. Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where), but the escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven—Elowen kneels, whispers, unsnaps, and rises without a reversal that changes his knowledge or options. Closure offers a Decisive Change in the form of seized mastery, yet the cost is conceptual at best ("bound allegiance") and not legible as a forfeited path or felt price on the page. The final image ("mastery over what might be") declares transformation without dramatizing the before/after stakes that would make it undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation (archivist, 1872, file room) within the first paragraph. The discovery of the hidden compartment and Amos's letter accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eleanor's purpose is renewed. However, the closure lacks felt cost—her grief is declared resolved ("healed...herself") without forfeiting a live option or paying a visible price on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no specific sentence in the ending beat demonstrates what Eleanor sacrifices or relinquishes to achieve this renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opts for a Causal lens but violates its logic: the puddle-map appears suddenly with no prior setup, Elias conveniently possesses the exact key needed, and the climax resolves via a cache of deus-ex data-slates rather than protagonist agency. Orientation anchors arrive reasonably early (alley, plaza, lagoon), but the closure—comrades reappearing via holograms and a regime-wide broadcast—happens to Elias rather than through his decision, undercutting the Decisive Change requirement. The "plans unraveling to reveal stronger threads" line tellingly summarizes rather than dramatizes the reversal, and the final paragraph's abstract promises ("freedom's code pulsed") replace scene pressure with thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated motifs (dewdrops, mist, prism) and musical pauses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elias hushes the prophecy and departs—but cost is told ("weight of silenced code lightening his step") rather than shown in forfeited options or visible consequence. The "one final dew-prism caught his eye, refracting a coded glint" micro-turn signals fragility but does not reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable pressure. No on-page price alters his stance or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, avoiding that penalty. However, closure never lands as a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—Lir simply succeeds at his stated task without friction, and the final paragraphs summarize outcomes ("arbor thriving eternal," "legacy: monuments eternal") rather than dramatizing a before/after shift. The piece declares a causal lens ("because/therefore" phrasing appears) but does not deliver motivated escalation or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The sylph's emergence feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choices, and the ending recounts triumph without legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias finds journals rather than treasure, validating the embrace of uncertainty. The piece follows an accumulative lens—pattern (clocks stopping at 3:17) triggers investigation, discoveries layer toward the final reweighting—and the lens holds. Cost is more philosophical than visceral; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening (journals over gold) reweights the premise, meeting baseline scope.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation (who/where/when) arrives cleanly in the opening. The lens reads hybrid—lyric accumulation toward a mystical ritual—but the coin-spin and crucible-repair lack because/therefore linkage: she mixes the elixir, spins the coin twice, and Thorne simply emerges with no on-page reversal or complication. The closure (brother freed, name redeemed) lands as Decisive Change, yet the cost is asserted ("potential forged in tension") rather than dramatized—no tactical sacrifice, forfeited option, or visible price paid in the final image. Waive the Orientation Test penalty; apply −0.6 for missing felt cost and −0.4 for outline sequencing in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory detail, musical dissonance, and confessional echoes rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Harlan's release via laughter) with felt cost implied in Elara's final bittersweet burden. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when), and the harp's distorted notes provide a consistent method that shapes the pursuit. However, no meaningful tightening occurs; Elara never doubts her approach, and Harlan's capitulation feels inevitable rather than earned through a decisive turn or micro-reversal that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph (passing). The drive lens is ambiguous—textural density suggests Accumulative, but the plot tries for causal turns via "remembering through trauma." Closure form is unclear: does she solve the equation, accept her state, or simply stand up? The final line "no longer a ghost but a map etched in her enhanced flesh" reads as conceptual assertion without on-page cost or a legible before/after in options or stance. The strap's etched equations appear only in the penultimate paragraph, resolving a puzzle the reader never saw her wrestle with.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: by ~120 words we have "market strung high above city," "between-worlds translator," "lighthouse lens fragment" phasing between states, but no grounded who/where/when anchor—Elara's immediate situation, the market's spatial layout, and the present trigger remain vague. The drive lens is ambiguous throughout: causal links are asserted ("The method had come to her in a hunch") rather than earned, yet the piece gestures toward accumulative texture without teaching a pattern by the first quarter. Closure claims "histories once overlooked now eternal anchors" but offers no on-page cost or foreclosed option—alchemists bow, visions cascade, the city "pulsed unknowingly"—all summary, no felt price. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity at closure (−0.4), plus caps.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (dust patterns, clockwork spirals, ceiling cracks converge to reveal the buried watchmaker). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change: Theo lowers the remains, ghosts dissolve, burden lifts. Cost is visible (the burden lifts "fractionally," suggesting partial relief rather than full resolution), but the turn feels procedural—solve the puzzle, release the ghosts—without a high-stakes choice that forecloses another path. The vision-dump ("memories flooded Theo's mind") tells the backstory rather than dramatizing it, softening causal pressure at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation debt is significant: who Elias is, where precisely he stands in the library, and the concrete meaning of "after the great unraveling" remain vague past the first 25% (−0.4). The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but causality is murky—frost "decrees," the vial "yields," events cascade without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the library's destruction seeds new orchards), but the cost is abstract: no on-page sentence shows Elias forfeiting a concrete option or feeling a personal price. The "bottled forever" and "moment eternal" are metaphysical claims, not dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias devises a plan, executes it during the storm, and destroys the shard to seed interpretive chaos. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—shard shattered, scholars forced to rebuild narrative—constitutes a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's revolutionary vision is seeded through destruction, with the cost (no possession, only provocation) legible on the page. However, the storm's mechanics and the scholars' pursuit feel underdeveloped; the turn from theft to destruction lacks a dramatized pressure point that would tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after dense metaphoric preamble, violating the ~120-word anchor window (−0.4). The closure—light reclaimed, daughter wakes—occurs on the page, but the causal chain relies on a late-revealed mechanism ("mending what isn't torn") that was never seeded or constrained earlier; the tether and frequency-realignment solve a problem they did not help create. Under a Causal lens (inferred from "because" phrasing and gear-logic setup), the link from adjustment to cosmic dawn-theft reversal is asserted, not earned. Cost at closure is gestural (tears, smiles) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into linear summary with weak causality. Orientation is delayed (factory archive appears abruptly, no spatial anchor for cliffs until midpoint). The closure unit fails: Elara ascends with "newfound weight" and "hinged awakenings" but no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The expedition transformation and guardian approval are told, not dramatized, and she simply continues her hobby enriched—no option foreclosed, no felt price paid in the final image. Causality breaks: psychometry visions gift the path and hinges without her earning knowledge through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered meanings, timewoven alliances, driftwood motifs). The opening orients who/where/when by ~120 words, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, closure lacks legible cost: Elara escapes via a lantern-sculpture that solves the GPS failure without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The "timewoven alliances" provide convenient assistance rather than forcing a renunciation or endurance with felt price. The final image ("plotting her next alliance-weave") asserts future intent but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The final beat offers only thematic summary ("reckon the beauty in what hides") and a vague promise ("her next mural awaited") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after legible. Orientation is delayed well past 120 words—who Elara is, where the pavilion stands relative to the cathedral, and when this occurs remain hazy until deep into the second paragraph, warranting a −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The accumulative lens is suggested by the slow reveal of glass layers, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; each discovery is merely additive without narrowing options or changing knowledge in a way that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (shard structure, lyric density, pattern of debris-oaths). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardians release Elias after he proves lineage, and he awakens "ready to broadcast these truths," foreclosing spectator status with visible cost (the searing ordeal). However, orientation debt persists past 120 words—who Elias is, where the zeppelin floats, and the dune-folk uprising context remain vague until deep into the retrocognitive sequence. The two-shard structure (library → lagoon → library return) is legible, and the ending image reweights prior material, but the Orientation Test failure and causality gaps (how the diary triggers retrocognition, why debris-oaths bind spirits) apply −0.5 and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece announces its closure—civilization reborn—but never dramatizes a moment where Elias's choice narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The amber bottle "hums," essences "solidify," and the town "pulses anew" through summary告 rather than on-page causality. Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where exactly he sits, and what the amber bottle does remain vague until deep into the second paragraph. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern is taught early, no cadence shift charges the final image, and the ending delivers a conceptual claim ("a legacy reimagined") without undeniable pressure or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure—the prophecy reweights Elias's archival work by exposing his unarchived loneliness. However, the prophecy itself emerges coincidentally from the relic rather than from Elias's agency, and the final vow ("sealing his fate to the accidental truth") remains abstract rather than a legible on-page action with felt cost. The midpoint shift from archive-ritual to prophecy-reception coheres thematically but the causal linkage is thin: the shaving "foretells" rather than Elias discovering or constructing meaning through choices.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: starlight intensifies, seeds germinate in reverse, entropy yields through a pattern of magical actions culminating in hand-plunged-into-vortex. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (seeds bursting, atrium thawing, vortex stabilized) but the cost is vague—what exactly did Elara sacrifice or foreclose? The phrase "borrowed time would snap back, erasing her lineage's extended years" sets stakes, yet the ending offers triumphant greening without visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the egg-hatching opener). One meaningful deepening occurs when she positions the cap and chants, but the final image ("ready to save not just seeds, but eternities") reads as assertion rather than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and the piece follows a single continuous scene toward a decisive change—Elias flips the switch and tolls the bell, altering the warning system with visible consequence (villages respond differently). The closure lands on the page with the bell's resonance amplifying microclimate detection and the siren silenced, establishing a before/after. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; the storm's arrival and Elias's response feel inevitable rather than causally tightened by prior choices. The cost (renouncing the siren's volume for subtlety) is conceptually present but emotionally muted, as no live option is foreclosed with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with atmospheric scene-setting but delays clear anchoring of who Elias is and what immediate problem he faces until well past the 120-word mark, creating orientation debt (−0.4). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful deepening or pattern break charges the ending—Elias's final stance ("vulnerability was no weakness") is stated rather than reconfigured through image or cost. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing, yet the conceptual cost is not legible on the page; he sets the lantern aside and resumes sweeping with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, the story needed a cadence shift or density spike to reweight the dominant stake; instead it delivers an abstract epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the ghost appearance (~15% mark). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ghost-dance clues, glass-box discovery, and ritual that mends the oasis, landing in Earned Stasis (perpetual vigil as guardian). The covenant untangling is conveyed through gesture and light rather than causal decision points, which fits the lens. However, cost at closure is stated ("heavier with fresh purpose," "isolation deepened, yet enriched") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic on the page, weakening the closure's felt weight. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost proof test is not fully satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural attempting lyric density, but orientation remains unclear past the 120-word mark (chronosurgeons, the Shift's mechanics, "numbers changed meaning" are asserted without anchoring when or where Elias stands in relation to these events). The closure unit—Elias broadcasting a new listing and becoming a "weaver"—lands as summary declaration rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the "timeless shard" and its dispersal are told, not dramatized, and no prior constraint is forfeited. The capsule's "breach allowed the Shift's chaos to infuse it" arrives as retroactive explanation, not causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story opens with clear spatial anchors (lagoon, shore) and a legible POV. However, the central "conflict"—kite breaks, poet repairs it—lacks meaningful opposition or narrowing of options; Elias encounters no obstacle he cannot immediately overcome. The kite's crash is framed as "anticipation" rather than loss, defusing any stakes. Closure reads as a thematic summary ("in the incomplete…lay the profoundest beauty") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the final image restates the premise without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—Elias's name, role, and the island setting arrive incrementally across the first ~200 words, and the temple orchard's spatial logic (pillars, oaks, vines, copper) is assembled piecemeal without a clear anchor by the 120-word mark. The dominant lens appears accumulative/textural (layering wire-wrapped branches toward a hum), but escalation is mostly additive ("ten branches... extended... final wrap") without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the humming lattice and arriving pilgrims, yet Elias's bodily death is elided ("vision faded, body stilling") and his "spirit lingered," which softens the promised cost into mystical persistence rather than a decisive forfeiture. No on-page beat shows a live alternative foreclosed or a felt price paid—his work simply succeeds posthumously without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, tower, spring, post-contact) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: data fragments, footprints, and amber touches layer toward the tower's activation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"homecoming wasn't destination, but the luminous convergence of skeptics seeking"—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the trio simply "pocketed formulas" without friction. The chemistry revelation feels convenient, arriving through passive projection rather than protagonist struggle, weakening the RR's felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orientation anchors (Thorne, jetty, after reef dies) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images (blooming vines, rusted blades, seed pods) build toward the final closure image of petals drifting to sea and garden reclaiming battlefield. However, the closure itself is a reported outcome ("The garden began its reclamation") rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost; Thorne departs unaltered, carrying "lightness" but no forfeited path or undeniable price. The conceptual repricing (death's domain → life) is asserted rather than made legible through a specific final act or image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: riddle → trek → reunion layered with recurring motifs (leaf, cylinder, "wild hush"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shared life-hunting stance replaces solitary retirement), but the cost is asserted ("tinted yet true," "flawed") rather than shown in a decisive forfeiture or tactical constraint. The riddle's solution and Mira's survival feel convenient—her location and survival mechanism are told, not discovered through dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of "echoed silence," temporal stretch, compass rose), but the closure—Elara stepping through the rift onto alien soil—lacks visible cost; the text asserts "confusion transformed" and "exploration bloomed" without showing what she forfeits or how her options narrow. The rift's discovery via sketch feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causal pressure, and the final image ("True north forever") is more assertion than felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the causality remains thin: Elarion climbs, swaps a piece, endures brief psychic resistance, and wins without meaningful constraint or escalation. The "corrupted queen" writhes and claws but is dispatched with a laugh and a smash, undercutting the declared stakes. Closure lands as a reset (sky mends, Arbiter grateful, thief escapes) but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off visible. The inferred lens (Causal) promises because/therefore linkage, but the resistance dissolves too easily for the closure to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: Thorne walks a pattern that layers whispered words until the penumbra detaches. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first third without clear anchors by ~120 words, creating mild disorientation that does not pay off at closure (−0.4). The closure—penumbra absorbed into the chessboard—lands on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the final image of Thorne "reborn" as historian lacks the visible forfeiture or friction that would make the price undeniable. One meaningful deepening (the accumulation of spelled words) is present, but causality is gestural rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of seeding glyphs builds toward thematic resonance). Orientation anchors are present early (bookstore, Elara, post-cataclysm timeframe). The closure—Elara realizes home is embedded in the labyrinth and sets the stone aglow—lands with conceptual repricing, but the cost remains abstract; we do not see what she forfeits or what path is foreclosed on the page. The escalation is more additive (glyph after glyph) than a meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a single-POV, continuous scene structure with clear spatial anchors (village square, abandoned hall, tapestry). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (self-forgiveness achieved via metaphorical traversal of the labyrinth), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—time thaws and villagers stir, yet Elias simply "walks on" with no visible forfeit or narrowed option on the page. Under a Causal lens (the decoding sequence suggests because/therefore linkage), the final move "pawn to king seven, promoting to queen" is a mental chess metaphor rather than a dramatized choice with stakes, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows "canyon," "towers of bone," and "Elara," but the inciting action (poetry sessions as rebellion) does not materialize until midpoint. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (verse layering) and Causal (sessions meant to disrupt the ritual), yet closure offers only off-page consequence ("Tomorrow, the ritual would falter") without an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The final image—Elara smiling and dreaming—asserts victory but does not dramatize cost or show stakes reconfigured on the page. Under any inferred lens, the ending lacks the required closure unit with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" (the alchemist's role) and "where" (floating workshop on acid sea) arrive early, but "when" (the breach, the timeframe) remains vague until paragraph two, and the statue's location/accessibility is unclear until paragraph three. The dominant stake—survival versus meaning-conjuring—is signaled but the causal chain is weak: matching charm to pockmarks triggers memory montages and then a deus-ex-machina statue cracking open with a crystal core that fuses the charm and lifts the barge, bypassing earned agency. Closure reads as Decisive Change (barge saved, alchemist certain), yet the cost is conceptual only—"no longer doubting"—without visible forfeiture or tactical tradeoff on the page. The lens wavers between Accumulative (memory quilting) and Causal (charm unlocks statue), never stabilizing; this ambiguity past midpoint warrants the −0.4 lens penalty and cross-cap at 8.0 for all categories.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through nostalgic imagery and the promise motif, deepening at the cave oasis and crystallizing when Elias completes the shell and witnesses the holographic memories. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly in the opening paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the seashell completed, promise fulfilled, nostalgia reframed as "cherished illusion"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted in narration ("truth of nostalgia … as cherished illusion") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or change in Elias's options. The textural deepening is present—faded oils to completed design, spring water mixing pigments—but the final image ("steps lighter") tells us resolution rather than showing a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. However, the closure relies on magical convenience: the vial's power bypasses any earned change in Elias or test of his claim that "whispers travel farther than shouts." The core premise—proving whispers beat shouts—is resolved by a literal magic object rather than dramatized effort, undercutting causal closure. Mira's arrival is compelled by supernatural scent rather than motivated by on-page choice or renewed trust.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Elias, signal station, post-hydraulic failure). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: nightly calls and incremental tower construction layer toward the final beacon ignition. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (villages rekindling, reverse migration flowing) with visible cost—Elias's tears, his lingering solitude, the station's transformation—legible in the final image. One deduction: the voices and censer mechanics function as convenient external guides, softening the protagonist's on-page agency and the felt cost of his labor.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal arc: Elias finds the relic, performs the ritual, tests the occlusion, and the orchard responds. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—he accepts the cost of deceit to preserve communal safety—but the cost is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (orchard, Elias, post-virus world), and the lens reads as Causal with an accumulative texture. The final cost ("pondered the cost…had occlusion truly healed") is told rather than shown in a choice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memories and gaps layer until the final reweighting when Elias realizes the stranger mirrored his own vigil. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias accepts his sentinel role with the boutonnière pinned, no longer alone but bound to strangers' final gestures. Cost is conceptual and felt: he owns the isolation as vocation rather than curse. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gaps align to reveal the stranger as echo. The middle investigation sequence flattens slightly into summary ("That night, driven to decode…"), but the final image recharges the opal dock and the flower with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Doorway moment lacks on-page cost: Elias sees visions and emerges "transformed" but no choice, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a live path with felt consequence. The causality is linear (chip→cavern→doorway) but the closure unit is a montage summary ("lingering promise dissolved," "loneliness ebbed") rather than a dramatized decisive change. The lens reads Causal in the approach but the ending shifts to thematic summary without demonstrating what Elias sacrifices or changes to "find home."

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens (dreams → climb → grotto → transformation) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when Elowen absorbs the starlight and gains resolve. However, the orientation window is muddy: who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the opening third, and the "final warning" timeframe remains vague. The climax—touching the pool and inhaling starlight—compresses causality into summary ("visions sharpened," "future laced with vengeful grace") rather than dramatizing the choice and its immediate cost. Closure lands but feels narrated rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within bounds, and the alchemy ritual offers a single-scene frame. However, no causal escalation occurs: Lirien returns with a pre-made solution, performs it, and succeeds without obstacle. The whispered secret ("revalue your fire, Thorne") does not arise from prior conflict or narrow options; it appears as thematic delivery. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the columella pearl, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible—the bond is "revalued" by assertion, and both characters "move as one" with no on-page price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (grave, past selves, soaring) that reweights the dominant stake of distilling chaos. Orientation anchors (Elara, cabin, Blackthorn Peak, post-grave-dream) arrive by ~10% but the chronological confusion blurs causality without teaching a clear pattern early. The closure—scroll complete, chaos distilled, quiet return—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts the cyclical chronicling role), yet the cost (what future or past self is she forgoing?) is implied rather than made undeniable in the final image. Penalty for lens ambiguity through the middle third: −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: morning fog frames the opening, the screw discovery accumulates meaning, and the final exchange with the customer offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the story shared, clock returned). Orientation is clear by the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks visible on-page cost—Elara's "work mattered" realization is asserted rather than forfeiting a path or charging the final image with felt consequence. The Miriam flashback, while evocative, is recounted rather than dramatized, reducing causal pressure at the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (floating platform, tea ceremony, guild trial stakes) and tracks a causal sequence: scars crystallize under stress → quill invoked → runes traced → crystals shed → transformation complete. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara emerges "untouched" with "the weight of crystals gone," achieving both guild acceptance and personal breakthrough without trade-off. The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture, and the ending reconfigures scars into "stories etched in eternal ink," but the transformation feels declarative rather than paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is present—Elara delivers the apology and receives forgiveness—but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt: "his melody forever altered, trees falling" gestures at consequence without showing what path she forecloses. The drive lens reads Accumulative (perfume → currents → manifestation → forgiveness), yet the causal chain relies on convenience: the bottle happens to induce currents that summon Theo with no prior setup of failure or resistance. Orientation anchors (archive, dusk, orchard beyond) arrive early and hold.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece offers orientation late (library, Elowen, dictionary visible by paragraph six in a 112-paragraph story) but the larger issue is closure: the final dozen paragraphs declare "illusions vanquished," "unity endured," "peace reigned supreme" without a legible decision or visible cost. The "spiral arbitration" unfolds as exposition—"he arbitrated stars' isolation against their gravitational embrace"—rather than a choice that narrows options. No felt price is paid; the universe simply "knit" and "breathed as one." Under any lens, this is assertion, not demonstrated change.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear early (station, fjord, Elias, hydraulic clocks) and the causal chain is traceable: whistle → dismissal → obsession → key discovery → backward count → revelation → correction. However, the climactic revelation ("clocks measured the shepherd's doubt, the razor edges of belief slicing certainty") is abstract and the cost remains unclear—what exactly did Elias forfeit or change by this understanding? The resolution feels declarative rather than dramatized with visible consequence. The inferred lens is causal-accumulative hybrid, but the ending drift toward abstraction weakens closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elena, library, post-heart-attack) arrive early and remain stable. The subway traversal provides a sequence of moves, but causality is thin: each scrawl directs her to the next location without narrowing options or raising cost, reading more as a treasure hunt than escalating pressure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she reframes her father's legacy and commits to teaching), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible trade-off, forfeited path, or felt price on the page. The drive lens wavers between Causal (the scrawls guide her) and Accumulative (clover-melancholy motifs recur), settling into a Hybrid that never quite tightens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story orients who/where/when cleanly within the first third and presents a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elias's lesson lands, Mira severs, cycle continues). However, the closure cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—"I get it now" and a smile offer no visible forfeiture or friction. The accumulative lens (looping calls, glass harmonica refrain) is taught early but the final "Another ring pierced the tunnel—wrong number, fresh start" reads as a return to equilibrium without reweighting prior stakes or showing what Elias has surrendered by pushing Mira away. The mechanics of "cultivated estrangement" are described but not causally dramatized: we do not see Elias pulling back "when vulnerability peaked" in a beat that alters Mira's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered ritual and motif repetition, but the closure—spectral form coalescing, covenant renewed—relies on convenience (the steep works because the text says it does) rather than pressure that narrows options. The "regenerated covenant" is declared complete without on-page cost; he fades "willingly," she walks away "lighter," and the final image offers reassurance rather than a felt price. The RR form is attempted but the reconfiguration lacks undeniable conceptual or emotional weight at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reciprocity builds through exchanges. Orientation anchors arrive early (station, dusk, community). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (loneliness fractured by reciprocity chains), but cost remains abstract: no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the "before" state against the "after." The rock's passage and Elias's lingering constitute the closure beat, yet the emotional price ("heart mended") is asserted rather than dramatized with a legible on-page loss or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who (blind mapmaker), where (ultrasonic forest), and the quest goal emerge piecemeal across the opening, touching the ~120-word threshold without anchoring all three cleanly (−0.3). The dominant stake (navigate emotional depths via the stillpoint) is signaled but the escalation is geographic (forest traverse) rather than causal tightening of choice or knowledge. Closure delivers a vision that resolves grief and completes the map, but the cost is asserted ("tears," ring removal) rather than dramatized as a foreclosed path or altered tactic. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in method but the ending supplies a Decisive Change (grief resolved, map completed) without prior pressure that would make refusal or persistence costly; the stillpoint solves rather than tests.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing—history editing as revelation—but the cost remains abstract; Elara's isolation becomes "brief quarantine" and colleagues "transferred safely" without on-page friction or trade-off. Causality is declarative: she writes edits, reality shifts, but no because/therefore chain links her choices to consequences—each stroke simply works. The piece teaches a lyric-metaphor mode early but abandons pressure midway for exposition of the pen's mechanics, then summarizes the anomaly's softening rather than dramatizing a decisive moment. Orientation is present (who/where/when by the opening), so no penalty there, but the drive lens wavers between causal (edits) and accumulative (metaphor density) without committing, and closure delivers theme assertion ("meaning threshed itself eternal") over a legible reweighting with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty applies. The piece attempts a causal arc—Elara recruits Finn, they perform, the crowd transforms—but the climactic "disruption" unfolds through assertion: guitars halt mid-strum, revelers freeze, tears glisten, all without dramatized resistance or choice. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Finn moves from invisible to recognized), but the cost is told rather than shown; the final line claims he is "remembered…by the bittersweet song" without pointing to an on-page forfeiture or altered option. Drive lens reads as Causal with aspirations toward Accumulative texture, but the lens wavers because the ending relies on summary rather than image or decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, underground archive, post-arson) and follows a clear causal trail: figurine → murals → portrait → tapestry → vault. However, the closure—Elara collapsing beside the sculpture and deciding to "portray it all anew"—lands as Earned Stasis but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or visible sacrifice makes the "before/after" legible with felt weight. The vandalized portrait functions as a micro turn (coordinates hidden beneath slashes), but the vault discovery resolves without a choice that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. Drive lens reads Causal through the middle, but the ending shifts toward Accumulative without teaching that pattern early, creating lens drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: drumming actions build through the garden to resurrect Kai, culminating in submersion and escape. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and her harness's function emerge gradually through the first third, creating mild fog. Closure lands as Decisive Change (escape from lab control into the shared dream) with cost visible in the dissolved harness and wilted garden, but the reversal hinges on convenient auric-mist mechanics introduced late rather than prior constraint. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lagoon responds and Kai coalesces.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (maintenance worker, container labyrinth, storm). The causal lens holds: Elias uses whispers because low frequencies survive geomagnetic interference, he mimics Harlan's walk to predict turns, and the zodiac-coin pattern unlocks the door. However, the closure itself—claiming the coin and refolding the map—lacks on-page cost; Harlan's surrender is told ("pride shattered") rather than shown as a decisive change that forecloses a path for Elias. The final paragraph's abstract victory ("legend echoed softly, eternally") replaces concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patterns build through the shutter weave and mirror-reflected starlight. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~150 words; "when" remains vague throughout). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Umbra "softened, edges blurring into twilight harmony"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the transformation legible with felt consequence. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cost-proof failure (−0.6) apply.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where the town sits, and what the Council's threat entails remain abstract through the first third. The closure—displays shift, doubts erupt, Elias smiles—registers as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("seeds had taken") rather than dramatized with a visible trade-off or forfeited path on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mounting symbolic pressure via chess motifs and magnetic synchronization), but causality is thin: the grotto's mechanics and the shopkeepers' compliance are convenient rather than earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established early (dock, twilight, post-Cataclysm world). Drive lens reads as Causal initially (scrimshaw → truth → island → escape) but the middle causality is thin: the scrimshaw warms once and unlocks hearts without resistance or cost, the whale calls conveniently when needed, and the island materializes on cue. The closure unit—cutting the rope and diving—occurs on the page, but the Decisive Change lacks felt cost because no live option is foreclosed; the dock life was framed as a cage from the start, so departure reads like wish-fulfillment rather than a sacrifice that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, kitchen, post-mandate era) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through repetition of whittling, narration, and the turbine hum, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she gathers the carvings and bouquet into a talisman and commits to tomorrow's performance. Cost is felt but oblique—"lightness lingered, morally ambiguous as mercy"—and the final image reweights prior material without a decisive physical turn. The lens holds, but the closure moment lacks a sharper on-page consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (the piece builds through repeated images and verse fragments toward a final resonance). Orientation anchors who (cloud-shadow poet) and where (cobalt atrium by frozen lake) by the second paragraph, passing the test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration via final image ("verses the new map," "hush deepened, pregnant with possibilities"), but cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page—no line shows what he gave up or what path closed. The ban-lifting frame and the dissolution sequence lack because/therefore linkage; events happen in sequence without causal pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who/where/when clarifies only after the opening phoenix image, and the "bartered awakenings" system requires mid-story exposition. The causal chain holds: Elias learns Mira's plant-code demand, retrieves the reed tongue, climbs to the phoenix, and uses the imperfect melody to secure her awakening. However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt: Elias retains his colorblindness by choice, but no on-page action forecloses a path or demonstrates visible sacrifice—he ends where he began, painting glass with Mira, rendering the stakes more thematic assertion than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of chamber-by-chamber deepening with recurring motifs (golden shadows, prism-song, carbide lens). Orientation is clear early. However, closure cost is vague: "scarred, resonant grit binding all" is thematic assertion rather than a visible forfeiture or reconfiguration that alters her stance. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame promises a journey structure but delivers a tour without meaningful tightening of options—each chamber adds texture but does not narrow her path or force a trade-off. The final kneeling moment gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks on-page evidence of what she has renounced or what new constraint she now faces.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain vague through the opening third—"timeless observatory" is spatially unanchored, and Elara's physical traversal through mist into a supernatural space lacks clear stakes or constraint. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres: the piece cycles through vignettes of origami-making without meaningful tightening or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is asserted ("stars bloomed eternal") but not dramatized; no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page with felt cost. The final paragraph summarizes rather than enacting transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (loft, post-crash 2047, Elara's cartomancy practice) within the first third and lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared inheritance and mapped resurgence pattern reweights the solitary mystery into collaborative duty. However, the escalation proceeds through exposition—Theo's letter, grandmother's foresight, the card-spread demonstration—rather than dramatized pressure that narrows options. The closure image (map reborn, world unaware) carries thematic charge but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift grounds the final stance. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (pattern-building through tarot and ink) and Causal (letter revelation changes tactics), settling on Accumulative by the ending's density shift, yet the midpoint handoff from Theo's confession to the spread feels more explanatory than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: Who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "lost civilization archive" and "saffron-veil historian" function as labels without spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara shattering her veil and emerging "transformed"—is told rather than shown; the cost ("dissolving personal patterns forever") is asserted in summary, not dramatized with a legible before/after choice. Drive lens appears accumulative/textural but the final image does not reweight prior material through concrete action or perception, only through declaration ("bearer of truths that burned"). The pagoda's mechanics (refracting "atoms of nostalgia") remain abstract metaphor without causal linkage to her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (library above clouds, dusk, Elara's role). The piece follows a causal arc: shadow corruption discovered → stone ritual initiated → metamorphosis enacted. However, the closure's cost—Elara "forever altered," mourning "human warmth"—is asserted rather than shown in a concrete final choice or image that makes the price undeniable. The metamorphosis itself is summarized ("Her form began to shift...") rather than dramatized, and the ending loops through multiple "resolved" beats without a single sharp reconfiguration that lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's ritual of shedding conviction-layers builds density and mirrors the chameleon's regeneration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she achieves balance and plans actionable next steps. Cost is conceptual—she acknowledges oversight and vows boundaries—but the final image ("reconstruction was complete") asserts resolution rather than making cost undeniable on the page. The causal link between Silas's betrayal and her present ritual is clear, yet the closure unit reads as told transformation rather than a dramatized tightening that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and the lens reads as accumulative/textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (hourglass, ivy, coffee rings) toward a revelatory object. However, the tunnel action and the box discovery feel coincidentally placed rather than causally prepared; the letters resolve an external mystery (parents' concealment) rather than a tension Elena has wrestled with on the page. The closure offers resonant reconfiguration (scars as owned narrative), but the cost is more asserted ("wounds staunched—not closed, but read") than shown through a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—layers of ghostly lyrics, film-strip memories, and spatial reconstruction build density toward the final projection moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara rewinds the film, projects the reunited couple, and smiles into the beam, reweighting her understanding of "unused love" as spatially stored. Cost is largely conceptual (she keeps the knowledge, returns the letters), felt rather than physical, but the final image does reconfigure prior material. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the escalation is mild—discovery rather than decision-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes a situational frame (artist's block, mystical ritual) but the escalation is purely iterative—Elara traces meteors across an "unwritten calendar" without clear causal progression or a tightening that narrows options. The closure unit (creativity freed upon waking) arrives as summary rather than a decisive change with visible cost; no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed: "who" and "what she seeks" emerge gradually, but spatial grounding (threshold, pedestal of ice) appears late and the timeline remains vague, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, elliptical fragments, motif accretion) and maintains it through closure. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (guard, dune, post-burn wasteland), satisfying the test. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the guard's role shifts from passive freight-tender to active spark-cultivator, crystallized in "dreamless no longer quite so" and the image of blooms glowing on. Cost is conceptual and felt—his prior dreamless stasis is broken—but the final image could land with sharper on-page consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when he touches the clock and the archive awakens, altering his tactics from guarding to nurturing. The lens holds, but the cost at closure remains oblique rather than viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (hum intensifies, arboreal symphonies layer meaning), but closure collapses into expository summary rather than a final image that reweights prior material. The golden sap-steam "rebirth" is told, not shown; the protagonist undergoes transformation via passive exposure, not agency-driven choice. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—are delayed past 120 words amid dense ornamental description, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The corewheel sequence introduces stakes ("ancient organism," planetary gears) too late to constrain earlier beats, and the final translocation is a vague gesture rather than a closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning, but closure fails the cost test: Elara's star-stamped courage and guide transformation are declared outcomes without visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The "traverse back, forever changed" summary replaces dramatized consequence. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The piece teaches its pattern of repetition and accumulative imagery, but the final RR lacks undeniable cost—no specific choice is refused, no relationship altered with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, motif layering) and the bolt discovery provides a causal turn. However, the closure—Elias pressing the bolt back and choosing to remain—lands more as thematic echo than a legible reconfiguration with visible cost; the "soul" regeneration claim is asserted, not demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior stakes. The Thorne backstory (via neural-link archive logs) is a convenient data-dump that flattens causality rather than dramatizing discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated cryptic messages, constellations pause and resume, and the final cascade reweights the pretender's claim. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, the closure—"thrones toppled in slow, elegant arcs"—is summarized rather than dramatized on the page, and the cost to Lirion himself (temporal binding vs. verity's triumph) is asserted but not felt. The Conceptual Repricing is present but weakened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias assembles fragments (logs, atlas page, core samples) in a pattern that builds density until the interplay of bleaching and gyres crystallizes at the climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final broadcast and pocket-folded atlas page reconfigure his witness role from passive observer to active sharer, with the cost felt in his decades of isolation now reweighted as necessary prelude. One causal seam: the "delayed revelation crested like a rogue wave" arrives without prior on-page friction or false hypothesis that the revelation overturns, reducing the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, the closure relies on a convenience artifact: the stone circle's hum broadcasts to rebel comms without prior setup of transmission mechanics or Elara's agency in choosing to activate it. The "rebellion reignited" outcome is told via summary ("distant voices rousing") rather than shown through a decisive on-page change with felt cost. The drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into Situational coincidence (ancient relic solves the problem it did not help create), and no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara's stance at the end is identical to her opening motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "Elder Mira" and "Reconstructed Caldera" appear early but the present action (brushing the plant, hearing its whisper) doesn't anchor until paragraph four, past the 120-word mark. The causal chain—plant whisper → dig → find kite → decode script → unseal embryo—reads as because/therefore, but the kite's cryptic script and the embryo's existence in Mira's satchel feel like retroactive puzzle pieces rather than motivated setup. Closure lands on the page (the sapling roots, visions flood, declaration to council) but the cost is asserted ("charts our path") rather than felt in a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The dominant lens is Causal, held through the sequence, but escalation relies on convenience (the triple moons align exactly when needed, the plants amplify her will without resistance).

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear (arboretum, seaside cliff, Elena tending plants). The freeze triggered by wind-as-drone-buzz accumulates pressure, and the photograph returns charged at the end when shared with the visitor, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she no longer freezes in fear but freezes to remember). However, the cost remains largely asserted in metaphor ("graft the scars right") rather than shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that changes her next action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present by the opening (who, where) but the closure unit—Elias weaving cards into a loom to "redesign reality"—arrives as a metaphorical solution to a problem that was never concretely dramatized on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of descent, threads, cards), but the final reconfiguration lacks visible, felt cost: we're told he's "reborn" and "transformed" without a legible before/after change in stakes or options. The "necessary darkness" descent functions as symbolic journey rather than a causal tightening that forecloses a path, failing the Closure (required) definition.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening paragraph, and the encampment's spatial layout remains vague throughout. The piece infers a Causal lens (drone message → ink patterns → disappearance → pursuit → revelation), but the closure unit—Elowen's understanding and Mira's return—lands off-stage in summary ("he understood now") rather than through a dramatized on-page reversal. The cost is asserted ("serene anger eased to resolve") but not visibly paid in action or image. Escalation is present (bandits → eclipse crisis → Mira's disappearance → void journey) but the final beat summarizes rather than shows the change.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a Causal lens: Elara sees the map, reads it as a sign, transmits the letter, and pods activate. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words of atmospheric description—but the disorientation does not pay off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure moment (pods humming, networks spreading, Elara smiling) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("scandalize," "allies in the ice") rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or visible consequence. The phrase "action had chosen for her" diffuses agency at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and offers a single tightening when looters arrive, but the closure—roses blooming with "engraved" petals and Jax's nod—reads as symbolic tableau rather than decisive change with visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image recycles prior diction ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") without reweighting stakes or revealing a foreclosed path. Elara's choice to sheathe the dagger occurs mid-beat and is immediately validated by plant-magic, bypassing felt consequence. The cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence in the ending demonstrates what Elara has lost or sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sound waves, patterns, imagery). Closure issue: Elias captures the echo and pockets it; the final lines promise future hunts ("The end? No—only the next cast"), which undercuts a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. No visible cost alters his stance on the page; he simply wins and moves on. The Cost proof test fails—no sentence shows a felt price or foreclosed option at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Causal with proof-by-contradiction mechanics, but the closure—Thorne's confession and Elara's vow—lacks visible cost; he simply admits guilt and she drives away with renewed purpose, foreclosing no live option. The ledger contradiction is told rather than dramatized, and the journalist's role vanishes without consequence. Escalation stalls in the middle third with repeated metaphorical orbits before the confrontation begins.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative/textural layering toward a causal resolution) but struggles with orientation: who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word mark, with "laboratory of lost sounds" functioning more as abstract concept than concrete anchor. The closure unit—Elias tattooing the amber pattern and "tethering" the firmware-haunt—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("guilt hushed at last") rather than felt or visible in a concrete forfeiture or altered option. The letters function as convenient exposition that solves problems they didn't help create, arriving fully formed with complete instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation (whispering grotto, unlearning ritual, Elara as artist) within the opening third and maintains spatial coherence. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the group falls into emergent hush; Elara scatters the mandala and pockets the tile flake with the whispered secret), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("ephemeral," "hidden design") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through the mandala) and Causal (tile flake revealing confessions), settling toward Accumulative by the end, yet the final scattering deflates rather than charges the image. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mandala resonates and silences the group, but Elara's agency in that moment is indirect—her art works magic rather than her pressing a choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure, but the closure—Kael staggering, weeping, then standing with arms wide—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration without visible cost; survivors approach tentatively but no path is foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~150 words, satisfying the test. The "rename" mechanism is introduced late (~60% mark) and resolves the conflict it did not help create, undercutting causality. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara aligns the chips, but the final image ("mending sky," survivors' hands outstretched) declares transformation rather than showing its price.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elena's despair lifts and she books a gig, with the coin as talisman. Orientation is prompt (Elena, streets, Mystic Maze Theater). However, the closure cost is abstract: "timelines mended" and "synesthesia now a gift reborn" are asserted rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The causal chain from encountering Reginald to rebooking work lacks a concrete on-page decision that forecloses a path; the transformation happens largely off-page between the orchard exit and "Back home."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (studio, post-static-shock), and the causal lens is signaled: Elara tests whether telepathy is real through somatic markers and light painting. The blind-test climax—willow branches appearing where Theo stood—lands as a decisive change with felt cost (tears, embrace, certainty replacing doubt), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the telepathy mechanism remains asserted rather than dramatized; the willow-branch reveal depends on convenience (how did the image encode his thought without prior setup?) and the escalation from first exposure to blind test compresses multiple moves into summary rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillates between causal (fossil enables floating) and accumulative/textural (lyric repetition of "transitional," "factually mystical") without committing. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she had become what she sought") but the cost is asserted in summary ("years blurred," "final float") rather than dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (cave, Lira, post-hibernation), but causality weakens after midpoint: the fossil "destabilizes" emotions into floating orbs without clear because/therefore linkage, and the ending's apprentice-training and fossil-release occur in tell-only summary.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who (Elias), where (amber warehouse), and when (tonight) within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. Under an Accumulative lens, the cataloging beats layer images and the jar's echo clarifies from "scrambled" to "harmonious counsel," achieving a pattern shift. However, the closure—turning the hourglass to "invert the flow" and "liberate" the prophecy—is declared rather than shown with visible cost on the page; the sands reverse, the jar is corked, and consequences are asserted ("fates no longer foreclosed") without on-page proof that options have changed or a path has been foreclosed. The final climb with the jar offers a gesture of intent, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives late—Elias's location, mission, and the snow-code mechanism remain vague until well past 120 words, though the mist-shrouded bluff eventually anchors. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of codes, relics, and agents coalescing toward renewal), but the closure unit—Lena igniting, Elias scratching new codes—offers thematic resonance without a decisive on-page cost that forecloses a path. The cyanide capsule is set up as a live option but never tests Elias in a dramatized beat; it remains a symbolic gesture. One meaningful deepening occurs (Lena's courage wakes), but the cost is asserted ("too burned") rather than made undeniable through choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillating between Accumulative (fog, needle, percolation motifs) and Causal (the unpicking reveals a core vow)—and never stabilizes by midpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but the coachman's goal and the passenger's role remain vague until late exposition. The closure image (yarn needle tucked safe, fog yielding) asserts resolution without demonstrable cost: no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized on the page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) and lens ambiguity (−0.4) apply; cap all categories at 8.0 per cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (wasteland oasis, Kai's search) early and offers a hybrid lens leaning accumulative-textural, with "fractured timelines" layering impressions until the pot-shaping moment. However, the closure lands as abstract insight ("resistance was no rebellion, but quiet turning") rather than a decisive change with on-page cost that alters Kai's options or relationships. The thrumming and lantern-glass visions function as atmospheric intensifiers but do not narrow stakes or force a trade-off; Kai departs unchanged in circumstance, carrying understanding but no visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (fire escape above harbor), and when (after rosebush's final petal) within the opening third. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: images of light/darkness, petals, and gauge teeth recur with modest deepening. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara watches Mira vanish and prunes the rosebush, framing tomorrow's seeds—but the cost is asserted ("wistfully pragmatic—tomorrow's seeds waited") rather than dramatized through a tangible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with orientation (who: Elara, where: Tidal Library, when: after reincarnation memory) established by the first paragraph, satisfying the anchor test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (mist, hum, sundial, spectral forms) that reweight Elara's stance from isolated to coexistent. However, the closure effect is asserted rather than shown: "Isolation transformed, independence eternal" tells the outcome without a final image that makes the cost undeniable. The sundial's alignment "with a new dawn" and Elara's laughter gesture toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but no visible price or foreclosed path appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure relies on convenient simultaneity: Theo appears holding a matching spiral at the exact moment Elara places hers, resolving their separation without earned causality. The orientation test fails—by line 120 (~"Pilgrims gathered at its edge"), spatial relationships between boat, installation, temple steps, and crowd remain unclear. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (prismatic imagery, lily pond setting) but attempts Causal resolution (the installation "amplifying connections"), landing nowhere coherent. No meaningful tightening occurs; the magical installation solves what Elara's choices did not create.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present: Elara activates the counter-signal, the divide softens, and tricksters are banished. The piece signals a causal lens but key turns rely on coincidence (Harlan arrives precisely when she's ready; enforcers sway on a demo with no prior setup for their susceptibility). The midpoint escalation—Harlan's confrontation—is resolved in a single paragraph with no cost or tactical adjustment. The ending establishes a "cautiously hopeful" equilibrium but the "cost" is abstract ("battles won in whispers") rather than a legible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first ~100 words, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Causal but with weak linkage: the organ's reverberation triggers spatial mutiny, and the compass transfixes it, yet these moves feel convenient rather than motivated by prior setup—the compass's anchoring power is revealed only at the moment of use. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (nexus quelled, key claimed), but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; Elias withdraws the compass and "claims" the key without visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The fallow period's grip "weakening" in the final third is told as consequence, not shown through altered stakes or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, what she's doing at the quarry, and why she's there emerge gradually across the first ~150 words without deliberate disorientation serving closure (−0.4). The closure—Elara's blood ritual yielding a vision of Lance—arrives via sudden omniscient insight ("Mira's final dance: not fleeing opposites, but entwined with one killer...") unsupported by prior causal links on the page. The ribbon fragment and vision do not narrow options through protagonist agency; the solution is granted rather than earned. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (investigation) and Accumulative (lyric mood-building) without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off under either.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative layering (fog, dread motifs). Orientation anchors arrive early (station, Elara, fog shroud), satisfying the test. The closure—transmission of evidence reversing the exile—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, but the cost is vague: "spongey dread lingered" and "greater exiles ahead" gesture at consequence without specifying what Elara forfeited or what path closed. The nail-unlocks-logs sequence provides one meaningful tightening, but Hale's instant confession and the guild's "cascade of affirmations" feel convenience-driven rather than earned through prior escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges gradually across the first third without clear anchors by ~120 words, creating drift (−0.4). The closure unit—vowing to follow the trail—defers agency to an off-page future rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost now. The hitchhiker's vanishing, the glass flake discovery, and the scaffold-wrap map feel sequenced by coincidence rather than protagonist causality. Under a situational or accumulative lens, the piece needed a crystallized stance or reweighted image with undeniable pressure; instead the ending summarizes intent without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows causal mode but relies on summary rather than scene work. The Orientation Test is satisfied early enough, but the startup's rise and Raoul's confrontation are told in compressed blocks without dramatized turns. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias remains at the train), but the cost is abstract—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or felt price is legible. The claim "paths circled to reveal" substitutes exposition for an image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture (variable stars → glyph alignment). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The closure—Thorne decodes glyphs, shares insight, temple glyphs glow—lands on the page but cost remains diffuse: "burden lifting" is declared, not dramatized through a forfeited option. The convergence (seventh pulse matching central glyph) arrives via dream-witness without prior on-page friction that the method could fail, lowering felt stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs (dream sketches → temple confirmation), meeting length expectations, yet the price paid is abstract rather than a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within bounds. The closure unit—Thorne accepting his confession and stepping from the lake "unguarded"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is declared ("carrying seed remnants and a unguarded soul") rather than made visible through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. Causality holds in the plant-melts-ice sequence, but the vortex's "unbending" and Thorne's internal transformation occur in parallel summary rather than because/therefore linkage. The final image ("Mirrors would still lie, but he knew their deceit") restates theme without reweighting prior material through concrete action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a visionary discovering a method to repair a fractured pact, but causality remains thin: the clipping appears as "the key" via vision rather than earned discovery, and the restoration sequence—press palms, roots manifest, eclipse lifts—reads as declaration rather than dramatized struggle. The Orientation Test is satisfied (Elara, glade, dusk, post-rift world by ~100 words). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (covenant restored, Elara still root-bound but purposeful), yet the cost is asserted ("fear of what futures might still twist") rather than shown as a forfeited path or altered state on the page. Drive lens reads Causal but linkage is more summary than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph; the single scene holds spatial coherence. Causality is present but thin: Elara finds the card, performs a ritual, and blood seals the pact—each step follows the prior, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs until the vague final worry. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant: "soul patched, trammel complete"), yet the cost—"wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's"—is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening legibility. Under a Causal lens, the ritual proceeds without reversal or narrowed options; under Accumulative, the pattern does not break or shift cadence decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: discovery of scrap → appraisal ritual → decision to authenticate and fund memorial. Closure is a Decisive Change (stepping from hiding into action), but the cost—emotional weight lifting, "chapter closed"—is asserted more than shown in a concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The final drive-away sequence extends the ending without deepening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (analogical thinking layered across beats). Orientation anchors arrive early (Elias, arbor, post-spirit-departure). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "at peace in the swaying heights" after planting the seed), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The seed's overnight sprouting and the arbor's stabilization feel convenient rather than earned by prior causality. Mid-story pilgrims add complication but do not tighten Elias's core stake.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The smelting sequence provides one meaningful deepening when contradictions are embraced rather than severed, and the final image reweights the premise (wonder preserved in routine). However, cost is asserted—"wonder reigniting"—rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. The closure reconfigures meaning but the felt cost remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by paragraph three, meeting the orientation baseline. However, the closure—Elias placing the pearl and walls "dissolving"—lacks visible cost or a legible before/after shift in his options or knowledge; the seals become "permeable portals" and he "smiles into the glow," but no path is foreclosed and no trade-off lands on the page. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural (crystal imagery, confessions, radiance), yet the final image asserts transformation rather than earning it through a decisive intensification or cadence break that reweights the dominant stake. The lack of on-page cost at closure prevents entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a clear decisive change: Elias arrives seeking forgiveness, finds graffiti affirming his quest, plays accordion, sketches his own addition, and departs "self-forgiven" without on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. The graffiti revelations are conveniences that solve problems they did not help create. Causality is weak: his methodical search does not narrow options or force a trade-off; the station simply delivers validation. The final paragraph asserts closure ("self-forgiven, he pressed onward") rather than dramatizing it. No visible, felt, or conceptual price is legible in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (veiled dreamer, glowing library, fateful letter). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mists, runes, and propagation delays layer toward the discovery of the inner sanctum. However, closure lacks visible cost—she simply "sealed her tome" after documenting words with no on-page price, forfeiture, or stance crystallization that reconfigures prior stakes. The "second letter's shadow loomed" is a gesture toward future consequence but delivers no felt change in the present, failing the on-page closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece declares a solstice deadline but never dramatizes its approach or consequences. The coffee-stain divination, ivy telepathy, and violin prophecy stack without causal linkage—each could be removed without altering the resolution. The closure states she "chose to lead the empire...as composer" but no on-page decision or renunciation occurs; the text summarizes the outcome in final-paragraph exposition. Cost is asserted ("destiny no longer perforated but laced with propagating life") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense atmospheric layering before anchoring who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "when" remains vague (timeless realm). The dominant stake—capture the spark before her own extinction—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs: Lirien pivots from extracting the elder's spark to infusing her own alongside it, reconfiguring her survival strategy. However, the cost is asserted ("Pain lanced") rather than dramatized with tactical or relational consequence, and the causal link between "finding patterns in static" and successfully channeling the spark is gestural, not earned through prior failure or constraint. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewal) but the felt cost remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains spatial coherence. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: climbing → hairpin discovery → vision → ritual scalloping layers meaning toward the closure image of contentment through cyclical surrender. However, the hairpin's appearance feels convenient rather than causally seeded, and the vision delivers exposition ("she was that woman, reborn") that shortcuts earned discovery. The closure reconfigures Elara's understanding of contentment, but the cost—surrendering to the cycle—is asserted more than felt; no live option is dramatized and refused. The final image ("We turn, we return, we are whole") lands thematically but without a palpable price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when anchors arrive quickly, but the causality from chime-reading to Alex's reversal is opaque—no because/therefore linkage shows how "crystal twice, bone thrice, iron hesitant" leads to unhooking betrayal. The closure unit—Alex deciding to call his friend—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted ("vulnerability bloomed protected") rather than dramatized with a legible trade-off or forfeiture. The lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage nor accumulative density clearly drives the turn, and the method (wind chime deciphering) is invoked but never operates as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens with ornate scene-setting but delays who/where/when anchors past 120 words, creating orientation debt (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The dominant lens remains ambiguous—lyric accumulation or causal decision—and is not taught by midpoint. No decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance occurs on the page; "ready to vanish" is preparation, not closure with felt cost. The stone-toss and ripple patterns are described but do not narrow Elara's options or reweight prior material in a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered dust, centuries, harmonic resonance building toward a pattern breakthrough). The closure unit—Thren's pulse-merge and motionless navigation—lands on the page, but cost is invisible: his body stills "amid the bone towers, dust sifting eternally," yet no on-page action, relationship, or earlier setup is foreclosed. The wandering pulse's "reunion across time" reweights the arrowhead's history but does not alter Thren's options or extract a felt price; the ending reads as arrival rather than reconfiguration with cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present by the second paragraph, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (automated era, icebound spire, Thorne). A single tightening occurs: Thorne unstraps bindings, enabling mist walking to reach the keystone. However, the closure lacks visible cost—grasping the keystone delivers power and promise without foreclosing a path or imposing a felt price. The piece reads under a Causal lens (because Thorne unstraps, he can mist walk; because he reaches the keystone, he gains power), yet the final beat offers uplift and potential ("promised rebellion") rather than a decisive change with on-page consequence. The inferred lens holds, but the Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes cost legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece opens with clear anchors (Elias, pier, lantern release) and delivers a decisive change—reunion with Lira—but the closure lacks visible cost: Elias gets what he wants without forfeiting or losing anything on the page. The causal chain is weak: the spectral librarian appears without prior setup, the key tag's sudden glow is unexplained, and Lira's transformation bypasses struggle. The orientation test is met, but the ending reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a closure earned through dramatized pressure and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Elara is, where precisely she sits in the cosmology, and what immediate danger she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, incurring the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens is ambiguous—elements of accumulative texture (amber motifs, static bursts) compete with causal claims (coins "guide," bursts "distill"), yet no clear dominant lens emerges by midpoint or at closure. The ending offers a micro turn (beacon ignites, universe stirs) but the cost is conceptual and oblique; the image of "newborn purpose" does not reweigh prior material with felt sacrifice or foreclosed path. No on-page decisive change or visible cost anchors the closure under any single lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation early (observatory, dusk, unearthed chest) and builds through layered invocations toward the naming climax. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elowen names the fears and integrates sacrifice's echo into strength. However, the cost at closure is asserted ("forever changed") rather than made visceral on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after boundary. The repeated naming beats accumulate density but lack a single decisive turn that narrows options or reweights the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elowen is, where precisely he stands, and what the viaduct's function entails emerge slowly across the opening third without anchoring "when" or spatial coordinates early. The bell-repair sequence strings actions (chart drips, heat oil, pierce channels) in and-then fashion without clear because/therefore linkage; the "surge cracked the repair wider" reversal arrives as external coincidence rather than a consequence of his choices. Closure offers a toll that "righted" imbalance, but the mechanism—drip-synced bronze—remains asserted rather than causally demonstrated; cost is claimed ("brittle devotion tempered") yet the on-page forfeit or visible change in options is thin. Drive lens reads Causal by intent but execution drifts toward summary declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed—Elias's name, role, and the resurfacing-town premise arrive gradually across the first third without early anchoring. The trail of photographs functions as a situational complication but lacks causal linkage: each photo is discovered in sequence without Elias making choices that narrow options. The closure—burning photos and sharing the label—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is abstract ("expunged shadows") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The lens wobbles between accumulative (trail of images) and causal (guilt revelation) without resolving to one dominant mode at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (ritual accumulation toward epiphany), but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara executes a prepared rite without complication, and the starling patterns arrive as deus ex machina confirmation rather than earned discovery. Closure is asserted ("harmony ignite within," "balanced alchemy promising") but no before/after is legible: no option was foreclosed, no visible cost paid, and the "final transformation" remains off-page abstraction. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when clear by line 4), so no penalty there, but causality is decorative: the crystal, flame, and birds perform their roles without resistance or surprise. The Orientation Test is satisfied, so cross-caps tied to orientation debt do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the radio call). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias spots the anomaly, revises the buckle protocol, adjusts the vector, and Lena lands safely—each step narrows options under pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias accepts the isolating burden and resumes vigilance with felt cost ("each vigil isolated him further"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the secondary vortex forces mid-transmission adaptation. Cost is legible in the final stanzas' isolation theme, though the fragmented ending dilutes immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: by ~120 words we have "floating rock dojo" and "clone custody battle," but the Blade of Verity decree, the jar's mechanics, and the vivification rite arrive as plot furniture rather than causally motivated turns. The custody trial nominally frames the scene, yet Kai's victory hinges on invoking an altar ritual never foreshadowed—resolving a problem the element did not help create. No meaningful tightening under pressure; the "complementary opposites" method is announced at the climax rather than shaping prior attempts. Closure unit: the brain vivifies and they touch palms, but the cost (numbness shattered, feelings flood) is asserted rather than paid on the page through forfeited options or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who and where within the first paragraph, avoiding orientation debt. However, the closure unit—laughter restored, figures fading into contentment—occurs without visible cost or a before/after that forecloses a path; the hourglass's end is declared absolute but never tested by Elias's agency. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered echoes, crescendo), but the final image dissolves tension rather than reweighting it with felt pressure. No persistent constraint shapes the ending; the symphony peaks and simply stops.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (frozen garden, mist, pendant). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density and imagery build toward the portal opening. Closure lands on the page (portal yawns, protagonist steps toward home), but the cost is vague—what exactly was risked or forfeited by interiorizing the cultist or waiting remains unclear. The "befriending uncertainty" arc functions more as theme assertion than a dramatized stake with traceable price. The causality of the pendant flaring and the portal opening feels convenient rather than earned by prior mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (ember nexus, Elias, crozier). The three approximation attempts provide escalation structure, but causality breaks at closure: nothing in the prior three failures explains why total obliteration succeeds—the logic ("creative destruction was the key, not partial") is asserted rather than dramatized through a discovery that changes his method. The ending delivers a decisive change but the "when the penny drops" insight lacks on-page grounding, making the closure feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid: Elara must tune the signal by shedding assumptions, leading to discovery of the gorge's design. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the cables "steadied," towers "revived," and Elara simply succeeds without forfeiting a belief, resource, or path. The "discarding assumptions" beats (stellar maps, linguist codes, bitterness, faith in endings) list mental items without on-page friction or consequence. The reveal that the gorge was "designed to await perigee" arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized action that changes her options.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (Elias, ferry, bay, twilight) and establishes a clear inciting anomaly (sideways clocks, translucent ferry). Causality runs adequately: spotting the hourglass → tuning the radio via its patterns → merging timelines. However, the closure effect—ferry solidifies, parallel Elias merges—lands without felt cost; the hourglass becomes a "talisman" in the pocket, but no path is foreclosed and no tension persists. The ending shifts to reflective summary ("his positive fire unquenched," dreaming of grottos) rather than a decisive image with visible price, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (patterned imagery, layered recurrence), but closure remains declarative rather than landing with felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern (memories altering, sinew threading, illusions erupting) yet the final "stability" and "connection's weave within" are told outcomes, not visible reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce only after ~150 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The eruption at midpoint offers a micro turn, but the ending summarizes rather than images a decisive change or charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure effect occurs on the page: Kai departs "ready for starlit depths" without any decisive change, cost, or stance crystallization—merely a declaration of future intent. The single scene is a lecture with holographic demonstration; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Orientation is delayed (benthic city, discovery context, alien nature all front-loaded in ~150 words of preamble before anchoring who/when/where in present action), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The piece reads as setup for an adventure rather than a complete pressure unit with on-page resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test fails: who Elara is, what "contact tracer for hearts" means operationally, and where the atrium sits in the sanatorium remain unclear past 120 words, triggering −0.4. The closure unit—Clara choosing to live—arrives via Evelyn's voice and the photograph, but the causal chain is thin: Elara's curiosity leads to the aid, which delivers a message that changes Clara's mind in two beats with no visible cost to Elara herself. The lens reads Situational (coincidence complicates), but the hearing aid's mechanics are never constrained or tested, so pressure does not crystallize through stance. Closure occurs on the page but cost is displaced onto Clara's tears rather than Elara's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors late—who, where, and when clarify only after the opening paragraphs; by ~120 words we have "Elara Thorne, claustrophobic spelunker" and "submerged path to the forgotten research facility," which is borderline but functional. The drive lens reads Causal (rappel → squeeze through → activate codex → phase out → collapse on cliff), and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she witnesses the unremembered and seals the cave, foreclosing return with felt cost ("her phobia a scar"). However, the mechanics of the codex-induced phase transition are introduced and executed without prior setup or cost; Elara "grips the tome, focuses on the glowing margins," and walls become translucent—no trade-off, no failed attempt, no price paid on the page for this breakthrough. The causal chain holds until that convenience pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (opal observatory, Elara, snow-buried setting). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ink patterns → defragmentation → ghost stabilizes → wisdom shared. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page cost; Elara absorbs wisdom and leaves with the shard, but no visible path is foreclosed—she could have done this before arriving. The ghost's stabilization and final whisper ("Live the count") offer thematic repricing, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a concrete choice or forfeiture. The causal chain is present but the ending reconfigures meaning without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines and moves through a compressed timeframe ("years blurred," then "one dusk," then the final ritual). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the diamond transforms from cursed to vault, the language is reborn in sound, and Thorne's purpose is "fulfilled." However, the cost remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final beat; "his final tale etched eternally" and a faint smile suggest satisfaction without felt sacrifice. The causal link between starling patterns and echo modulation is asserted rather than demonstrated step-by-step, weakening because/therefore tightness at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the "Missing Return Changed everything" exposition arrives mid-opening without concrete anchors. The closure—Elara floating, weightless and whole—offers a Decisive Change, but the causal chain is broken: the arrowhead blazes without prior constraint, and the phone confessions trigger metamorphosis through assertion rather than earned causality. The drive lens appears Causal early but collapses into summary at closure, undercutting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. Drive lens reads as Causal-leaning Hybrid (music triggers tree awakening, then physical uprooting), but the because/therefore linkage between "resonantly soft" violin pulse and the trees' heartwood response is asserted rather than causally grounded in prior world rules. Closure—iron roots torn free, statues jamming, beauty flooding back—occurs on the page, but the cost is generic scene consequence (gears clattering) rather than a visible personal or tactical price Elara pays. The "gap between knowing and understanding" recurs as abstract motif without reweighting prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of absences, drone launches, vial depletion). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (acceptable). The closure—receiving coordinates to the Expanse—lands on the page but lacks visible cost: Elias pedals away with a new destination, yet no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The bottle's fury and the arcade's witness gesture toward resonance but do not reconfigure stakes with felt consequence. Causality is intact but the ending image does not crystallize a before/after with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and recurring motifs ("whispering gleam," "misting hush," "chime of wind bells"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (Elias, abandoned circus train, twilight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of wheels turning "whispering life into the quiet" reweights the dominant stake (reviving carousels through silence). However, the cost is implied rather than undeniably legible on the page—no explicit forfeiture or friction crystallizes in the ending image. The "wrong turn" setup is buried mid-story and the oasis discovery feels coincidental rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final image), but the escalation is unclear: Eliza begins determined to map story-space, performs a ritual, sees memories bloom, then simply reaffirms the same goal with no narrowed options or visible cost. The scarf "warmed" and colors bloomed, yet this reversal does not alter her tactics or foreclose a path—she "refolded the scarf carefully" and promises to return, a soft reset. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly and the piece avoids causality breaks, but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the "portal half-opened" and "reawakening neared completion" are declarations without an on-page change in knowledge, stance, or consequence. The final lines loop back to the opening premise ("The place where stories live beckoned") without reconfiguring what that means or what Eliza sacrificed to approach it.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a ritualized pattern (three dawns of light-painting) that deepens and then crystallizes into a closure image—the captured dream vitalized but forever fixed. Orientation anchors appear late (lighthouse library, archipelago) and remain atmospheric rather than spatial. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara holds the print, longing "forever etched," and resumes her role with the palette enshrined—a crystallized stance with conceptual cost (dream as memory, not flesh). Cost is legible but oblique; the final image reweights prior material without a decisive physical act, which suits the lens but lacks the visceral edge for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "across the hush of cosmic possibility" offer atmosphere but no concrete spatial or temporal anchor. The closure attempts Earned Stasis (locksmith remains at his post) but the cost is asserted in summary ("Improbable longing fulfilled, yet ever-renewing") rather than shown through a decisive on-page choice that narrows options. The accumulative/textural lens is signaled but the final dozen fragments dissolve into a list of theme statements without a legible reweighting image. Orientation Test penalty applied: −0.4; Q3 capped at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: sensory fragments and lyric callbacks (mushrooms, broken constellations, flood imagery) build density toward the memory restoration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—memories restored, habits broken—with conceptual cost legible in "the fairy ring's glow fading behind him like a door softly closing." One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias traces the constellation alignments and the memories flicker back. The cost is felt but slightly abstract; a sharper on-page forfeit would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately and closure occurs on the page (Kai's shadow freed, exile reversed). However, the escalation is largely coincidental: the shadow appears "peculiar" without prior setup, and the geometric key solution emerges smoothly without a meaningful tightening or cost that forecloses an option. The lens reads Causal but the tea-leaf → shadow-sigil sequence lacks because/therefore pressure; the resolution feels convenient rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Lirien is and what the heirloom seed does remain vague past the opening third, though context eventually clarifies. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (texture and density building toward a pattern-charged ending), but causality is weak: Elowen's arrival, Lirien's decision to help, and the seed's transformation occur without on-page resistance or complication. Closure lands as Decisive Change (the tree erupts, wonder restored), yet the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid by Lirien or Elowen that forecloses a live option. The ritual sequence reads as explanation more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery and motif repetition dominate), but the closure lacks visible cost: Lirien's "fractured core" is mended off-page, "lucid unrest evolved to quiet resolve" is told rather than shown, and no path is foreclosed with on-page consequence. The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied by ~120 words (prism sanctuary, mask restorer, tonight), but spatial choreography drifts—silt, net, workbench, and prisms lack stable spatial logic. The because/therefore chain is weak: the shade's confession stretches "across hours" without pressure escalation, and spirits are released in a loop rather than through meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when early and follows a causal chain from map tear to archive research to site visit to discovery. However, the closure—Elias frames the map anew and smiles at the frescoes—lands as summary rather than on-page decisive change; the cost (risk, social exposure, emotional reckoning) is asserted ("his methodically curious heart sated yet guarded") but not dramatically visible in the final image. The keystone reopening and compartment discovery feel like a sequence of reveals rather than a tightening that forecloses options. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage holds through the middle but the ending reconfigures meaning only through summary statement ("Now, known embraced unknown"), not image or action with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague; the spatial relationship between Earhart's plane, the sunken ship, and Elara's movements is never stabilized (−0.4 Orientation Test). The closure unit—releasing the snow globe and ascending—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding achieved), but the cost is conceptual only, not felt on the page; no prior tactic or option is visibly foreclosed. Causality is weak: the snow globe's appearance and the note's preservation are coincidental conveniences. The piece drifts between causal and accumulative modes without teaching a stable lens by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density and symbolic layering build toward a moment where Elowen's encoding releases the ghost. Closure lands on-page (the ghost surges free, thunder rolls as harmonious echo), qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option for Elowen herself. The flower press bolt plate's function (aligning graffiti stencils, overlaying symbols) is told in summary rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, weakening causal legibility at the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words of ornate setup, and the promotion backstory ("ascending servant") remains vague. The drive lens reads Causal (diary unlock → identity reveal → decision to claim inheritance), but the final image ("ready to claim the heights") asserts closure without showing a decisive change in tactics or options. Cost is conceptual (Elowen's legacy accepted) but not dramatized; the final beat tells us she has "tender resolve" rather than showing a trade-off or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational frame (adrift, untethered) and accumulates atmospheric pressure through categorization beats, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elias finds proof in the void's "spooled wholeness." Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening). However, the closure unit—his whispered-back proof and the origami release—feels more like thematic validation than a decision or renunciation with visible cost that alters his options on the page. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural with Situational undertow) wobbles slightly as the ending reads declarative rather than reconfigured under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elara discovers the coin's encoded method, deciphers it, and crafts the mirror array under tightening time pressure, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sky mirrored within, her limits transcended) with felt cost (the tree's demolition, her work's anonymity). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The escalation from discovery to craft to completion coheres, and the closure image—"the sky endured, fractally precise and eternal"—reweights the opening stake. One friction: the middle section leans heavily on reflective exposition about the guild's limits and Elara's artistic philosophy, which dilutes immediate scene pressure and delays the peak crafting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Causal with adventure-plot beats: discovery → decoding → activation → escape. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Decisive Change (airship reactivated, course set to the rift), but the cost is unclear—she cheers, the birds disperse, destiny awaits, with no visible forfeiture or narrowed future. The hopscotch-board solution arrives conveniently; her palm-press activates borrowed glow without prior setup of that mechanism, weakening because/therefore linkage at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who and where early (Elias, frozen library) and follows a causal chain: prophecy scraps → hall of mirrors → gear alignment → uncapping. However, the Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("the rhythm was not mechanical precision but the patient weave of loss and longing") is told rather than dramatized with visible cost—Elias learns but does not forfeit or renounce anything on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (images and motifs build toward a cadence shift), yet the final visions ("father's hands guiding his during that final eclipse") arrive as summary flashback rather than live pressure, weakening closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who is focalizing, where they stand, and what immediate problem drives the opening remain unclear past the first third. The ghost's messages function as a quest-giver mechanism with no earned motivation on Lir's part—why now, why these four, and what cost does he pay? The climactic bell-ringing is coincidence-resolved: butterflies appear, blight vanishes, with no protagonist trade-off or narrowed options. Closure is a Decisive Change in the orchard's health, but the protagonists' agency is passive obedience; the cost is conceptual (trust a ghost) rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraphs and moves toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias completes his vow, the clock "eases back," and he dies with the puppet head crumbling—an Earned Stasis that forecloses his vigil. However, the cost is more asserted than dramatized; we are told the clock shudders and children receive comfort, but the causal linkage (how the nested patterns transmit song through the hush, why this act buys "a sliver of mercy") remains elusive. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dusk imagery, nested motifs, the pane's hush—yet the final beat does not land a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: travelers enter → frost deadline tightens → Elias retrieves blueprint → nuts carve path → travelers escape. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias retreats with blueprint and reluctance intact, accepting the cycle's cost. However, the cost feels muted—his emotional state circles back to the opening without visible foreclosure of a path or deepened price. The "frost spread like lace" image charges the moment but doesn't decisively reconfigure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: foam patterns, chrysalis, and ravine imagery accrue toward a final resolve. Orientation anchors early (polymer chemist, braided ravine, dusk). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias's insight reweights rigid polymers as flexible, biodegradable bonds—but the cost remains told ("grief now a soft undertone") rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or crystallized final image. The coda (months later, toxins captured, butterflies return) deflates closure pressure by solving the problem off-page and flattening the before/after into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias performs a ritual quantifying absence, moonlight charges the slate, fragments bloom into a map, he descends. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—"the place where stories begin" is revealed as "absence's cradle—zero point before first word"—but the cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture or altered tactic appears on the page after the vision. The orchard's "first opening day" frame and the ritual's mechanics provide coherence, yet the ending dissolves into lyric assertion ("Elias, reformed, found it") without demonstrating what he sacrificed or how his options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rain → puddles → tidal pool analysis → stairwell → pavilion → pool-by-pool alchemical smoothing builds density toward a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors (Kharidun, chef, post-rain) land by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elaris subsumed the stored remorse, his own guilt is "sandpapered," and he returns "ready to cook anew, memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen." Cost is implied—hours of absorbing collective anguish, enduring contagious remorse—but the final image presents resolution as complete smoothing rather than a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The pavilion "dimming as if exhaling" and his "steps lighter" suggest cathartic release without a price that remains legible on the page. No major causality breaks, but the cost at closure reads emotional satisfaction rather than felt or conceptual sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elara's bridge construction should narrow options and force stance crystallization, but the montage elides all reversals between conception and completion. The orientation anchors (tower, silos, starlight) appear early, waiving the Orientation Test penalty, but the middle montage ("Hours earlier, she'd rallied crews…") compresses the entire build into summary, erasing on-page escalation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the talks "rehabilitated," disputes "dissolving in the chorus"), yet no visible cost attaches to the final image—hands clasp, laughter bubbles, and the bridge stands as symbol without felt sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The weight drop is vivid but serves setup, not a turn that changes knowledge or narrows Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what concrete problem she faces remain vague past the opening third, and "profound transformation" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a ticking constraint. The drive lens wavers between accumulative (cascading dream-fragments) and causal (mirror modification), never stabilizing. Closure reads as a declaration ("no dream abandoned") without visible cost or a before/after choice that forecloses a path. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, and the closure unit lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by the second paragraph satisfies early grounding. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("forgotten combinations no longer hid"), but no decisive on-page action or visible cost accompanies the claim—Elara simply "memorized the patterns" without trade-off or foreclosed option. The gravitational inversion provides a time constraint, but causality is weakly linked (she leaps, floats, touches a crystal, and emerges transformed by assertion rather than earned struggle). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elowen kneels, finds the insulator, threads it, strums, and the grove responds—a tightening via density and cadence shift rather than because/therefore causality. Orientation anchors (siskin alder grove, Elowen, post-Stillness dawn) arrive early. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove "forever subtly changed," siskins alight, Elowen pockets a chip), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page renunciation, injury, or forfeited option makes the "forever changed" tangible. The Orientation Test is satisfied; the lens holds; the closure unit exists but lacks legible price, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts Accumulative closure: monoliths hum, covenant stirs, Elias walks away with tentative renewal. Orientation is prompt (Elias, nexus, twilight, pre-phase) with no delay penalty. However, the closure unit lacks felt cost—exile unbroken, phase unchanged, guardians "perhaps watching" hedges commitment. The correlate-silence mechanism unfolds in a series of moves (pawn shadow, rook shift, king alignment) but reads more like ritual checklist than because/therefore linkage that narrows options. One tightening occurs (final silence → fracture glimpsed) but the RR remains conceptual without on-page forfeiture or embodied consequence that reweights tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece presents a single problem (locked diary) and a single solution (frequency tuner) with no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the opening paragraphs without early anchor (−0.4). The closure (clasp opens, he writes, fireworks boom) delivers a Decisive Change in object state but the cost is invisible: nothing is sacrificed, no path foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized on the page. Drive lens reads as Causal but the "because/therefore" chain is mechanical (tune → clasp opens) without escalation or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: "who" (Elara), "where" (treetop village), and "when" (dawn/tide turning) anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric elements. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (serenity as poise within sway), but the cost is told ("her path forever scented") rather than shown in a decisive on-page forfeit or reweighted image. The Orientation Test penalty does not apply here; −0.3 in Q2 once for lens clarity drift (the piece wavers between causal ambition-plot and lyric meditation without fully committing until the end). Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Elara, glider, Arboris Prime, inversion approaching). The piece follows a causal lens: inversion enables flight → water-flow navigation → cavern discovery → artifact retrieval → planting. The closure is a Decisive Change (artifact planted, echoes stir, groves will revive), but cost is asserted rather than felt: "Her brother would have approved" and a smile substitute for on-page friction or forfeiture. The retrieval scene notes "echoes wailed silently, vines retracting in shock," hinting at planetary harm, yet Elara's exit and planting proceed without consequence or moral reckoning, muting the cost proof at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation adequately (investigator, port, post-crash) and attempts an accumulative lens through survey documentation. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Elias enters, documents wind patterns, finds a patch, continues documenting, then transmits findings. The closure ("foresight sown") is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The causal chain is linear (survey → data → report) without a pressure point that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Cost is conceptual at best and not legible in a specific on-page image or forfeited choice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes orientation early and delivers a closure beat (the bell-strike unfettering wonder), but the closure lacks visible cost or meaningful foreclosure. Elyra performs the ritual successfully without sacrifice or trade-off; "mission fulfilled" signals completion but no felt price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (dense sensory layering), yet the ending does not deepen or reweight the dominant stake—wonder is simply validated by assertion rather than tested. The orientation test is satisfied, but the closure unit fails the cost-proof test: no on-page sentence shows what Elyra loses or forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is established early (Thunder-echo Range, three moons post-failure, Elaron alone), but causality is thin. The driftwood markers enable the weave mechanically without dramatized cost or complication; the flute triggers the veil-tear instantly, and the spectral confrontation delivers insights without resistance or trade-off. The closure—"Elaron cased the flute once more, markers already crumbling to dust"—gestures toward transformation but does not show a decisive on-page choice or forfeiture that narrows options. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain dissolves into serial staging; under Accumulative, the pattern does not deepen with visible pressure. The piece reads as a Quest Completed template without friction that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (topaz workshop, Elias, star-vanishing timeframe) arrive early and remain stable. The causal chain is present but weakened by coincidence: Mira arrives exactly when Elias activates the fragment, and the transpose peaks without clear protagonist agency driving the escalation. The closure image—"new star flickered faintly," "Elias reset the press"—gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost is vague; no concrete option or relationship is visibly foreclosed, and the ending returns to status quo ("His habit unbroken") rather than reweighting prior stakes. The lens reads Causal-hybrid but wobbles at closure when the fragment's power is "spent" off-page and resolution hinges on passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the closure unit—Kael realizing his deliveries have woven Thorne's absence into legacy—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "Kael, the jittery courier, became the myth's next verse"). Cost is felt but somewhat abstract: no concrete path is foreclosed on the page, and the final image ("pressed on, coaxing the world awake") asserts transformation rather than showing a visible trade-off. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (auroral imagery, pendant motif, myth-building pattern), and it holds through closure, but the cost proof is oblique—more conceptual repricing than a tangible loss that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (Elias at quartz arbor, winter morning) and follows a single POV through one location. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias accepts mysticism, objects validated), but the cost is unclear—he gains vindication, colleagues "would scoff" (future tense, off-page), yet he smiles in triumph with no visible forfeiture. The arbor returns multiple times but functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint. Causality holds through the frost-reading sequence, but the shift from scientist to mystic feels asserted ("Firmly grounded no more in denial") rather than earned through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors appear late: "Deep within a bamboo forest" and "Elara, a wistful loom spinner" land by line 3, but who she is addressing and what immediate problem she faces remain vague until "One mist-shrouded morning" past the 25% mark. The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (density increase toward a charged image), but causality is thin—Elara finds puzzle edges by chance, weaves without setback, and vanishes without on-page resistance or micro-turn. The closure image (bead half-buried, waiting) gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted ("her life force dimming") rather than dramatized in a visible forfeiture or renunciation. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: azure imagery, silk-weaving, and rubble-to-sentinels build density toward the floating-arch restoration. However, closure lacks a single decisive image or reversal with legible cost—Elar emerges with sentinels, arches stabilize, orchards bloom, but no specific choice or renunciation is dramatized on the page. The ending summarizes outcomes ("no longer meek shadow," "world reborn") rather than showing a final act that reweights prior material, producing a Resonant Reconfiguration without felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" (sensory map maker), "where" (abandoned bay), and "when" (dream-murmur haze) coalesce slowly, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered sensory maps, parallel glimpses), but the piece toggles between causal plotting (shard redirect) and lyric murmur without teaching the pattern by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("weave eternal"), yet cost remains asserted ("weight of truth a steady hum") rather than shown as a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice. The redirect action cycles through multiple universes in summary rather than one decisive on-page turn with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when promptly (Elias, lighthouse, storm night, lamp fails) and follows a causal thread: lamp dies → climb → discover stacks → read chain → Elias writes reply. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's vow to protect the chain, articulated in his note and the rebuilt stack), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered letters, stone towers, the sea-glass talisman). However, the cost at closure is only implied—"his protection a silent vow"—without an on-page forfeiture, delay, or concrete price that alters his next move or relationship with Harlan. The final paragraph also contains visible text artifacts ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]") that break immersion and muddy the closure image, triggering the artifact-at-closure penalty. Under the Cost Proof Test, no exact sentence makes the price legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (Emerald Lighthouse, post-midnight, post-print epoch) early and maintains spatial coherence. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Elias's choice to alter the beam's angle triggers the summoning of ancient shadows, which then manifest offshore. Closure is a Decisive Change—humanity wakes to a "world reborn in balanced shadow"—but the cost remains abstract and off-page; we are told mortals "felt the shift" without witnessing a forfeited option or consequence that alters Elias's stance. The visions in the wick provide a prophetic trigger, yet the leap from routine steering to shadow-summoning lacks intermediate resistance or complication that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the single-scene structure and accumulative lens are clear. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elowen's realization that the donor's gift carries both allure and danger, and her decision to "wield it watchfully" and "illuminate them wisely" crystallizes a stance. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted ("lest the magnet's force crush the bearer") rather than felt on the page through a concrete forfeiture or visible tradeoff in the final beats. The revelation emerges from the wing's pattern rather than from Elowen's active choice under pressure, which softens causal drive even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is late: who (Elias), where (tower), and why (tree-witnessing quest) coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of descriptive setup, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (moonlight heals, dreams map, sorrow dilutes through ritual layering), and closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing: trees witness "healing, not heavens." However, the cost remains abstract—numbers "zero," the sextant "reborn"—without a visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off on Elias's part. The causal chain is more catalog than pressure: he collects, overlays, repeats, without a reversal or tightening that narrows his options. Closure reconfigures the premise intellectually but does not land a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure effect—realm rekindled, night dispelled—reads as a Decisive Change, but causality is weak: the three songs succeed without obstacle, and no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes felt cost. The accumulative lens is signaled (layered songs, gathering spirits), yet the escalation is additive rather than tightening, and the final image ("light prevailed") summarizes rather than dramatizing a before/after with visible price. The cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara sacrifices or forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense exposition before anchoring who/where/when in a comprehensible frame (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara stepping through the wall and receiving a tome—lacks felt cost; she gains membership without forfeiting anything on the page. The drive lens oscillates between causal (invitation mechanics) and accumulative (nested paradoxes as texture) without teaching a coherent pattern, and the ending does not land a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with undeniable pressure. Backstory dominates the present without altering a live choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles motifs (bread, tea house, courtyard, frost) and reaches closure when Mira's "I forgive you" and their vow to tend the garden together constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited option or action. Mira's arrival is coincidental, not motivated by prior causality, and her confession ("I noticed the bakery gone months ago") does not tighten choices—it only echoes Elias's guilt. The final image ("birds would return; so would small wonders") reweights prior material but without a visible price paid on the page, weakening the closure's grip.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~60 words, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: frequency sampling builds density toward a resonant chord. However, closure lacks legible cost—the library "ascends once more" and Elias smiles, restoring order without on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path. The vows stabilize, but no visible price is paid; the ending declares success rather than dramatizing a trade-off or renunciation. Without felt cost at closure, the RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) claim is not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal lens holds: Lila's three attempts fail, forcing escalation to public exposure; the truce breaks, deal thwarted, and she escapes with her recording. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—trust shattered, recording captured, Lila vanished—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the market's truce "forever scarred," her own lingering unease), though the emotional and relational price for Lila herself could be sharper on the page. One meaningful tightening (from covert sabotage to public accusation) is sufficient for this length, and the because/therefore linkage remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes who, where, and when early enough to pass the Orientation Test. However, the causal chain is weak: Elara climbs the bluff "driven by a singular motivation" but encounters the weather-walkers through coincidence (her ring points; they happen to be there). The ending delivers exposition—"forests' gift during elections...awakening dormant cosmic anchors"—rather than an on-page decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost. The final lines loop through multiple false closures ("Wait, trim to fit—no, recount precisely...") that read as unrevised scaffold rather than taught pattern, obscuring where the closure unit actually lands. No visible price alters Elara's options; she "departed changed" is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain: Elias destroyed the lock, hid spare parts, uses mnemonic recall to reconstruct the lock, retrieves sketchbooks, and resumes sketching. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—Elias sketching freely—lacks visible cost; the "suppressed creativity" is uncorked without forfeiting anything on the page. The reversal (broken lock → repaired lock) is mechanical rather than charged with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—gilded leaves, zinc fragments, and candor accumulate pressure toward the vault revelation and final inscribed insight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara shifts from chasing phantoms to inscribing present truths, visible cost in letting go of mentor blame. The vault reveal lands on-page with conceptual cost (mentor's lie versus archive's candor), satisfying closure requirements. Minor orientation debt in early greenhouse navigation (vines, underlevels, conduit) resolved by map convergence at vault, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens (symphonies, glistens, layers building toward a beacon effect) but offers no meaningful tightening or reversal. The iceberg arrives, Elara builds, pilgrims ascend—each beat is additive without narrowing options or raising cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the bluff as eternal beacon), yet no felt price is legible on the page; Elara's toil "persists" in summary rather than forecloses a path. The ending recycles the opening mood without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orientation is clear early (glass dome, desert, android caretaker) and the causal chain—magnetic shift → static → box opened → chaos → miniaturization → incineration—holds without breaks. However, the closure effect is muted: Zeta achieves "wholeness restored—not seamless, but beautifully fragmented," yet the cost is stated rather than shown in a decisive final image or action. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture, but the ending dilutes pressure through summary ("Petals glowed," "harmony") rather than a single resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs (chaos erupts, then is contained), meeting the length requirement, but the final lines lack the charged specificity needed to reweight prior material with undeniable force.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elena is, her curator role, and why she cares about the mailbox emerge across the first 15% without spatial or temporal grounding until "At dawn, she entered." The causal chain from locket → courtyard → stories → code → mailbox resolution reads as outline-level because the storytelling method (hearing clues embedded in tales) is asserted rather than tested against opposition. Closure is a Decisive Change (mailbox opens, letters heal), but the cost is declared ("feuds dissolving") not shown; no path is visibly foreclosed. The "outside world intrudes" timeframe complicates atmospherically but does not narrow Elena's options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Elara is, why she's diving now, and what "corporate saboteurs" means remain vague until well into the piece, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure involves dancing to unlock a vault and then reviving colleagues, but the causal chain is weak: the dance-as-explanation and the sudden cryo-pod discovery feel introduced for convenience rather than earned by prior setup. Cost at closure is asserted ("vulnerability forged into collective strength") but not dramatically visible on the page; we don't see what Elara loses or forecloses by this choice. The drive lens appears Causal but linkages are often declarative rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.2)
    Drive lens reads as causal but the chain is stitched by convenience: coffee-ground divination arrives fully formed, the whale's heart is exactly where indicated, and piercing a gravity pocket floods back all memories without complication or price. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor early), but closure lacks on-page cost—Elias suffers no loss, makes no trade-off, and the final image ("ensuring the fluctuating pockets would nurture the memories") is a summary gesture rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt weight. No meaningful tightening occurs; the quest simply succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece anchors who and where by the second paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, causality is purely mechanical: Elias decides to perform the ritual, performs it, and succeeds without complication, reversal, or cost. The closure unit—"prophecy forever silenced"—is asserted rather than shown; no on-page moment demonstrates a decisive change, reconfigured options, or felt price. The inferred lens is Causal, but because/therefore linkage is absent; events proceed as outline steps. Apply −0.8 for closure absence and −0.4 for outline-sequencing that lacks pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately by the Victorian on Elm Street, and the rooftop meteor scene provides a clear closure unit where Harlan confesses and hands over the seal. However, the escalation relies on Elara's sudden interrogation rather than prior causal pressure; her week-by-week suspicion is summarized, not dramatized in choices that narrow options. The closure—Elara speaking to the building—lands as a Decisive Change, but the cost (what she forfeits or risks by speaking) is asserted rather than shown. The lens reads Causal with summarized ellipses rather than motivated linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~60 words; no penalty. The piece reads as Accumulative with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elara archives the memory, translating isolation into independence. However, the ritual itself unfolds without meaningful resistance or cost visibility—she completes each step, the memory transfers cleanly, and the result is declared ("no longer tragic but tempered") rather than shown through a charged final image. Cost is asserted ("quarantine dissolved," "weight now a talisman") but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elias severing the tether via blood ritual—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization freeing him from grudge), but the cost remains asserted ("no longer bound") rather than shown through a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The accumulative lens (ritual steps, stalactite rhythm, aurora as witness) is taught early but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; we are told he is free without seeing what freedom now denies him. Causality is clean within the ritual sequence, but the ritual itself solves a problem (the tether) introduced only in this scene, weakening necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: by line 120 the reader has atmospheric description but unclear spatial choreography (who stands where, what the nexus physically is). The closure—Elyra walks away having "learned"—is told rather than shown as a decisive change with visible cost; the shell's whispers solve the riddle off-page. Causality is weak: the merchant lunges, then the guardian "seals" him in one summarized beat with no prior setup of the guardian's stone-web power. The "webs of intrigue" premise dissolves into exposition rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: cameo visions layer until the mate's betrayal coalesces. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure unit—Elara extracting the locket and the ghosts sighing into peace—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (purity salvaged, windows sealed), but the cost is asserted ("ghosts sighed") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift on Elara's part. One meaningful deepening occurs when cross-threading reveals the mate's treachery, satisfying the length requirement, yet the final beat lacks a visible price that alters Elara's options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (Kai, parapet, lagoon). The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via charged imagery ("patterns eternal, effort forever honored"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt price. The net-mending sequence provides one tightening but does not narrow live options or force a trade-off. Causality is loose: fireflies "respond" to whistling without clear motivation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (wasteland, orchard, homestead) and the causal chain holds: dust → orchard anomaly → letters → diamond → decision. However, the closure unit—Elias reburying the diamond and walking away silent—lacks visible cost; he pockets a fragment but no on-page consequence alters his options or forecloses a path. The piece teaches a causal lens but the final reversal (debunker protects the lie) is told rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows future action. Cost remains implied rather than legible in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, prophetic fragments building to a visionary culmination), but the closure unit lacks legible cost. The final paragraph offers atmospheric assertion ("dawn forged in shadow's playful pyre," followers unified, loneliness banished) without a visible price that forecloses a path or reweights prior material. The penultimate beat ("wondered if the dawn would blind or burn") gestures toward ambiguity but is immediately smoothed over by "promise kept" and "shaped it all," erasing rather than charging the question. Orientation is clear early (stormlit observatory, Elias, radio receiver), so no penalty there, but closure remains decorative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift at closure. The story anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph and accumulates images (jars, music box, waltz) toward a final reprise that reweights Elias's purpose. However, the central "sweetening" action—mixing captured essences—occurs without clear before/after pressure; the music box melody is described as "sour with neglect" then "lush and luminous" with no on-page resistance or cost to the transformation. The grandmother's tear and penny offer a felt moment, but the closure recedes into summary ("Generations would whisper through his jars") rather than a decisive image that reconfigures options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering; closure is a Decisive Change (wraiths absolved, key secured). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. However, the climactic solution—tuning the lighthouse to match the wraiths' frequency—is introduced and executed in a single move without prior groundwork or cost; Elias never attempts a failed tactic or sacrifices an option. The wraiths' transformation into "luminous petals" lacks visible price to Elias or the world. The ending resets to stasis ("key secured") without foreclosing a live path or altering his stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present but delayed—WHO (Elara, horizon mapper) and WHERE (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake) arrive early, but WHEN remains vague until "months ago" retrospective. The piece follows a causal lens: ice enables crossing, moon-path tracking times the field weakness, cable severing frees the lowlands. However, the decisive change occurs entirely through Elara's technical success without on-page resistance or cost that alters her options—the viaduct shudders, yokes fall silent, she descends. Closure reads as mission accomplished rather than a reconfiguration with felt price; "impatience sculpted into patience" is asserted in reflection, not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid Causal-Accumulative (the lantern unlocks memories that reweight Elara's present stance; train reverberations accelerate the merge). Closure is on-page—Elara emerges, dials the hotline, walks into the storm—but cost legibility is weak: we see the symbolic phone-smash and are told she calls for a restraining order, yet the price of leaving Marcus (homelessness? retaliation? social isolation?) remains abstract. The Orientation Test passes (investigator, tunnel, post-drought established early), and the two-shard structure (tunnel investigation + memory merge) holds, but the causality borrows heavily from coincidence: the lantern appears exactly when needed, and the train's timing unlocks the final memory surge without Elara's agency driving the discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs (phone destruction), but the closure reconfiguration lacks the undeniable on-page cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias vows to advocate with "aptly deliberate" grace, reweighting his earlier failure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (guilt accretes through memory, the music box's revival, and storm imagery converge to shift stance). Orientation is clean. Cost is felt but oblique—he recognizes Marcus deserved better, yet the vow itself remains abstract promise rather than on-page forfeit or tactical shift. The Harrow scene delivers one meaningful deepening (the heart ticking) but the climactic insight ("second opinions...deserve to beat anew") reads as thematic summary rather than dramatized renunciation or crystallized choice with immediate consequence, holding the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: who Elara is, where the workshop floats, and when this occurs remain vague past the opening third, with "dawn's evolution" and "evolution's midpoint" offering only metaphoric placeholders. The closure—workshops lifting, bell ringing silently—lacks visible cost; Elara's final whisper is assertion, not a dramatized forfeiture or shift in options. Causality is loose: the kaleidoscope "transliterates" glyphs into an algorithm through metaphor rather than motivated process, and rivals mock from afar without on-page consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight prior material with legible pressure or price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Elara's fixation leads to pattern discovery, lie, archive unlock, crew revelation, and corporate purge. Orientation anchors (corporate memory keeper, Social Nexus Archive, her cubicle) arrive early enough. However, the closure unit—"became the bridge to the deleted"—lands as metaphorical assertion rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; the job-loss consequence is told in summary ("The lie had cost her job") two beats after the climax, diluting the felt price at the moment of reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Thorne is, where the vintage store sits relative to the orchard, and what the "weighted breath before reply" timeframe means remain vague well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—reconstituting the crystal ball via shadow-threading—arrives as convenience: the fragment "hums" and "shards orbit" without prior setup of mechanics or cost, and the holographic map solution appears ex nihilo. The causal link from "aligning glimpses" to "peace sealed" is asserted, not dramatized, leaving the decisive change feeling told rather than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece signals accumulative/textural design with repeated motifs (windborne solace, trawl, the sound) and moves toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Liora shifts from tourist to witness, anchored by Tomas's crumple-sigh. Orientation is provided by ~line 10 (drift-ice marina, emergency tent, post-fall). However, the closure moment ("No more trawling needed; the endings sang clear now") arrives via summary declaration rather than an on-page image that makes the cost undeniable; the parasol tip's loss is stated to "mark her transformation" but the mechanism remains told. The escalation—listening at bedsides, then at the trawl, then beside Tomas—accumulates density, but the final turn lacks a decisive on-page moment where the cost is felt rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is prompt: Elena, autumn dusk, vacant station, vineyard pavilion. The story follows a Situational lens—Elena arrives, listens, reframes her quarrel—but the closure is a summary declaration ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") rather than an on-page decisive change or charged image. The reversal (quarrel as revelation rather than fracture) is asserted in Theo's dialogue and then told in the penultimate paragraph, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Cost is conceptual but abstract, not anchored in a concrete final image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when remain vague past ~120 words; "whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion," and the prophet's prior arrival are atmospheric labels without spatial or temporal anchors (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The consecration unfolds as a sequence of decorative gestures—three clearings conjured, chanted over, dissolved—with no reversal, complication, or cost that narrows options. The parapet "shudders once, then steadies"; success arrives without friction. No legible Drive Lens emerges: beats do not link causally, accumulate pressure via pattern break, or crystallize a situational stance. Closure reads as completion of a to-do list, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story establishes Elara arranging photographs but does not dramatize a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows her options. Townspeople gather and immediately participate without resistance, erasing pressure. The closure—Elara closing the case and walking away—lacks visible cost; no on-page sentence shows what she has sacrificed, endured, or foreclosed. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift with cost; the ending offers only a return to the opening posture without reweighting prior material or making a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation adequately (library, Elowen, post-dictionary dawn) within the first ~80 words. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal testimony reweights language growth as "eternal in reflection, even in silence," and the final image ("Crystal waited patiently") sustains that reconfiguration. Cost is conceptual but legible—Elowen's voice embedded, the hush only slightly lifted, "words were done." The escalation is densification of fractured sequences rather than causally linked turns, fitting the lens. However, the middle meanders through catalog-like voice fragments without a clear pivot that narrows options or deepens the stake until the testimony paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of imagery and recurring motifs rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—Elias achieves his quest ("age's captured voice") and the final image reconfigures "tidal longing" into "quiet certainty"—but the cost is asserted more than dramatized on the page ("a prophet armored against oblivion" tells rather than shows the price paid). The escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for this length, yet the recording moment itself lacks friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, moonquake, spinning clock hand) arrive early. The drive lens reads Causal: quake → spinning hand → observation threat → leaf-calibration → restoration. Closure lands on-page when the hand slows and Elias captures the pulsar, followed by a reflective coda that offers Conceptual Repricing ("escape velocity achieved—not in flight, but in capture"). However, the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page; the final paragraphs tell us he "ached for its return" and found peace without showing a visible forfeiture or tactic shift that costs him something legible in the moment. The moonquake pressure is real but the resolution hinges on detailed craft work whose stakes feel more technical than existential, and the extended epilogue (colleagues, polishing on, beaming to Terra) diffuses the closure beat rather than concentrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara, mountain aerie, after blood work) and moves from hymning to Lena's arrival to Harlan's peaceful death—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for Harlan, reconciliation for Lena). However, the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than a tightening that narrows options; Lara's phone call succeeds off-page, and Lena's arrival feels scheduled rather than won. The closure image (vinyl shard on Harlan's chest, "key to whatever melody awaited") lands with thematic resonance, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative is dramatized in the final beat. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (hymning layers memory and scent), yet the pattern lacks a decisive cadence shift or density break that reweights the stake with undeniable pressure at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world detail and task beats (brushing grime, turning key, mending rune-loops) but lacks a meaningful pressure turn or deepening that narrows options. Closure reads as simple task completion—Elara solves the puzzle and gains knowledge—without visible cost or a path foreclosed. The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when anchor by opening lines), but the ending delivers information rather than a reconfiguration of stakes or meaning with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive gradually but remain vague past 120 words (family estate, "tonight," village unspecified) without payoff at closure; apply −0.4. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted ("mistakes...into constellations") rather than shown through a foreclosed path. The substitute body inciting incident vanishes after setup; causality fragments into a tour of symbolic objects. Drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation or causal?—and not taught; apply lens-ambiguity penalty −0.4. Cap Q2 at 7.2 per cross-caps; score lands lower due to causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (polishing transforms sea glass into a beacon; memories accumulate and settle). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (grotto, Elara, tonight). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara reframes her earthbound state from chain to choice, and the village adopts her method—a cadence shift that reweights her stance with visible emotional cost (unburdening, acceptance). However, cost at closure is more stated ("felt unburdened") than shown through a decisive forfeiture or visible price paid on the page, and the villagers' adoption feels convenient rather than dramatized with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moss garden and amber pendant recur, aiming for Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the icicle pattern/"Seek the amber glow" summons arrives with no prior setup or cost, reading as a convenience that moves the plot rather than a tactic shaped by prior pressure. The pendant exchange lands as Charged Poise, but the cost is asserted ("viral storm outside faded") rather than felt through a forfeited option or visible consequence. Orientation is established early (data center, post-confession), satisfying the test. The closure image reconfigures the viral/private dynamic, but the reconfiguration lacks causal grounding in Elara's prior choices—Kai's arrival and acceptance feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and the drive lens reads as accumulative/textural (collecting shapes to fuel the novel). However, the closure—Elias stepping back "whole" with manuscript "alive"—lacks legible cost; the text asserts transformation without showing what was forfeited or genuinely altered. The ritual-collection structure is coherent but no choice narrows options or forces a visible price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Elowen's singing activates the loom, which spins stories that restore practices and heal blight. Closure is Decisive Change (sacred practices bloom anew, blight retreats), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no on-page sacrifice, failure, or foreclosed path that Elowen herself bears. The villagers' transformation happens to them rather than through contested choice. The spare vine tendril coiled in her pocket suggests easy repeatability, undercutting the stakes of this alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Lir gathers materials, creates patterns, ignites flash paper, and achieves a map-as-closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the map reveals Eira's path as "not ended, but ascending"), but the cost remains largely implicit—tears freeze, he kneels, yet no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The final beat ("loss became direction") offers conceptual repricing, but the felt price is diffuse rather than a sharp narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias gathers echoes through iterative observation and calibration across time markers (dawn, midday, dusk, night, next day). Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraphs, but the cavern anchors by ~150 words and the lyric mode teaches patience. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: the timer mechanism is "repaired" and wonder is "stored," but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture, no path visibly closed. The final image ("keys to memory's vault") restates the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, what "fractal weaver" concretely means, and the grotto's spatial layout remain hazy past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred from layered imagery and the calcification climax, but the closure—Elara "coalesces" and touches the burner as "promise"—lacks a clear before/after in her options or stance; the cost (being trapped, then freed by hardening) is asserted rather than felt through a decisive renunciation or choice. The piece teaches its pattern of nested metaphor but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (widow, loft, circus grounds, kettle boiling). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through the ritual of carving, layering memory with each cut, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where she "contained eternity while it boiled." Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes raw grief for crystallized control—but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle's rising whistle paces her toward completion. The closure lands cleanly under the lens, though the cost feels more asserted ("Tea could wait") than dramatized through a forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accrue until Elias confronts his ghost and steps away from the carousel. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stepping back, vowing "grounded hunts"), but the cost is asserted ("regret lingered") rather than dramatized in the final image. Orientation is delayed—carousel, lagoon, and Elias's scavenger role are not anchored concretely until multiple paragraphs in, causing mild disorientation. The ghost negotiation is the dominant stake, but the turn (ghost refuses, Elias offers the wheel, pact forms, Elias descends) feels summarized rather than pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Elara's sextant discovery enables navigation, which enables rerouting, which awakens the resonator. Closure occurs on-page when the resonator chimes and offers "a route to untouched worlds," but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—"hope, quantified" in her notes—rather than a visible forfeiture or tension. The inferred lens (Causal) is stable, yet the ending image doesn't crystallize what she sacrificed or risked to achieve this resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—petrichor and crystal motifs pattern the piece, and the music box returns with reweighted meaning. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts his introverted path and the dream's transmutation. Cost is conceptual (years of neglect, "forgotten promises") but remains atmospheric rather than legibly foregrounding a foreclosed option on the page. The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), and the lens holds, but the cost proof test struggles: no single sentence at the ending beat makes the price unmistakable in action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt accrues: "by the silence of morning radio" never anchors time-of-day or causal trigger past ornamental metaphor; the canal setting drifts without spatial grounding until the wreck appears. The salvage itself—lowering into mud, extracting crates, finding the twin sundial—unfolds as a checklist without reversal or cost; no option narrows, no tactic shifts. The closure image ("understanding complete," dual sundials as weight) asserts thematic arrival but offers no on-page decisive change, earned stasis with visible price, or conceptual repricing; the before/after is declared, not dramatized. Drive lens remains ambiguous between accumulative pattern (motif recurrence) and causal pursuit, never cohering at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors arrive early (Elias, golden dock, harbor fog). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's pact with Kael crystallizes his preservation mission and the rope's wisdom is secured for the next generation, with the cost felt in his resumed solitary gathering. The piece accumulates pressure through the decoding sequence, but the final beat ("Teach my boy, then. Don't let it sink.") lands as agreement rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path or imposes visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.7)
    The piece establishes a situational frame—Elias alone in the garden after the ships depart—but delivers no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. The obituaries accumulate without escalation; no reversal or choice alters his stance. The closure ("he was whole") asserts transformation but offers no legible before/after with felt cost: we see no path foreclosed, no option sacrificed. The orientation test is borderline: anchors arrive gradually across multiple paragraphs, and the "traveler who writes obituaries for the living" label remains abstract past the 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elarion is, where the palace floats, and when this occurs emerge slowly across the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—bird emerges flawed, palace quakes, Elarion vows to nurture—reads as Charged Poise (options crystallized, cost felt in the palace's violent shudder and the creature's imperfection), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture that alters Elarion's next move. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery, cadence of "hypothesizing" and "quaking"), yet the ending does not decisively reweight the stake; it restates the premise in image form.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients who/where/when by the second paragraph (Lira, obsidian lagoon, cloud migration timeframe). The dominant stake—healing the land and her heritage—is signaled early. However, the grafting action unfolds as a demonstration with no on-page reversal or complication; Lira completes each step without friction. The closure ("kelp-drift peace enfold her, father's shadow yielding to harmony") reconfigures her stance (Resonant Reconfiguration / Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (kelp-drift peace, volcanic imagery, scars-as-song motif), but the final image restates the opening tone without a decisive tightening or pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumb trail accumulates toward the key and box-opening. Orientation anchors (city, Elara, geese, fountain) land within the first ~100 words. The closure unit—opening the box and releasing memories—occurs on-page, but the cost is diffuse and externalized (city awakens, geese resume) rather than a felt personal trade-off for Elara. The breadcrumb sequence provides linear structure, yet each step feels like checklist advancement rather than causal tightening that narrows options or raises stakes for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with repeating imagery (petals, pings, gear) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elowen embeds the gear and retreats, crystallizing her legacy. Cost is present but oblique—"her form dimmed slightly"—and the reconfiguration of generational patterns is asserted more than dramatized. Orientation is clear early (nebula garden, Elowen, gear). The closure image reweights prior material but relies heavily on summary rather than a single charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elias returns nightly, the ribbon unfurls further, specters add layers, and the migration provides a temporal container. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, dusk, butterfly migration) appear early. However, the closure—Elias seeing grief as interlocking threads—lacks visible cost; he simply "realizes" and "rerolls the ribbon," then leaves "forever changed" without forfeiting a tangible option or foreclosing a path on the page. The final image gestures toward resonance but doesn't land a decisive reconfiguration with felt price; the transformation is asserted rather than demonstrated through a constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words), but the closure unit—Elias withdrawing the rake handle as visions complete—lacks visible cost; he simply "felt emerged" with "absolution complete," a told resolution. The causal lens holds through the ascent and vision sequence, but the pendulum-pause mechanism introduces a magical intervention that solves the thematic problem Elias did not create on the page in this scene. The visions cascade without on-page choice altering tactics, and the final descent shows harmony restored by fiat rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the echoes "harmonized into silence") but lacks visible cost—Elias remains "still blithe," with no path foreclosed or option narrowed. The causal chain is weak: the chess game, sovereign case, and tapestry threads connect via thematic adjacency rather than because/therefore logic. The ending explains the noblewoman's "intentions unveiled" through summary exposition in the penultimate paragraph, obscuring what stakes were actually tested. One micro-turn (echoes sharpen to a woman's plea) occurs mid-piece but does not alter Elias's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—seeding innovation under the Constraint Edict—is signaled, but the closure unit is problematic: "The quill descended, infinitesimal from union... But in that suspended breath, transformation endured, uninkable yet inevitable" asserts change without showing it. The piece ends in Charged Poise, yet the cost is claimed rather than felt on the page—no prior choice or forfeiture makes "prevail he did, forever" legible. The causal chain (data gathering → model building → enforcer approach) is linear but does not narrow options or force a visible tradeoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is severely delayed—who Elara is, where the alcove sits, and what the story famine means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The closure (dust now tells stories, ending the famine) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; we see no on-page consequence or foreclosed path. The piece reads accumulative/textural but lacks a decisive pressure turn or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual accumulates detail (ignite, powder, scatter) and the final image reweights the premise with a felt cost ("grief's rock would resume in subtler forms"). Orientation anchors who/where/what early. The rocking chair's stop functions as a clear timeframe gate that triggers the ritual. Cost is visible in the doubt and mask removal, though the ending's questioning ("had he truly captured her") slightly diffuses the charge rather than crystallizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens with orientation debt (who Elias is, his specific location within the sewer, when "one dawn" occurs relative to "weeks prior") that persists past 120 words without teaching a pattern; the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies here and triggers the Q3=7.0 cap. Drive lens appears Causal but the actual linkage is weak: discovery of the cog does not narrow Elias's options (he was already preserving methods), the three-layer excavation sequence adds density without closing off paths, and the ending ("preservation begun; narratives competed, but his endured") asserts closure rather than demonstrating a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elias loses, risks, or forecloses by fusing the cog and broadcasting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality operates in summary loops: "Across weeks blurring into months, the timeframe stretched; unlearning hatred became their silent vow." No on-page reversal narrows options; the climax ("Now, braid") is told as accomplished fact without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. The closure asserts completion ("harmony prevailed") but lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt price on the page. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal without clear pattern-teaching or a cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from ruin-pruning to seed-planting to first-shoot emergence, building density through memory-tasting and celestial imagery. Orientation is clear early (rusted greenhouse, celestial alignment, Elias alone). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tender shoot and the vision of future rebellion crystallize the new state. Cost is implied in "cities blooming" and "Regime might raze it again," but the on-page price is abstract—no immediate forfeiture or visible tactical narrowing. One meaningful deepening occurs (pruning → planting → vision), meeting the length requirement, yet the cost lacks concrete bite.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (toll booth, tower, blackout, nectar dusk). The piece follows a causal chain: blackout → Mira's question → Elias gives riddle → Mira ascends with new understanding. However, closure relies on summary assertion ("She'd seed new drones...restore the hive") rather than an on-page act or image that reweights options with felt cost; the final image of Elias smiling and tallying the till offers mood but no decisive change or renunciation. The drive lens reads Causal through the middle, but the ending drifts toward thematic summary without locking cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—"creeping normality noticer" and bay context arrive, but no concrete spatial anchor or present-scene frame appears until the orris-root discovery, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The piece unfolds as a summary of weeks of ritualized collecting and sanctifying with no single dramatized beat where a choice narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending claims community transformation and reversed "creeping normality," but this change occurs off-page through reported neighbor behavior; no on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is legible. Drive lens is ambiguous (accumulative pattern is hinted but never coheres into pressure or a reweighting moment), triggering the lens-ambiguity cap.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (underwater garden), and the inciting secret early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: three cascading revelations deepen understanding of the ancestor's choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifted stance from vengeance to nuanced resolve), but the cost remains abstract—"surfaced not with vengeance, but resolve"—rather than a concrete forfeiture or price paid on the page. The ampoule-threading beat provides a physical turn, yet it functions more as revelation delivery than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early, and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (staircase ascent, looping proofs, die symbolism). However, closure lacks decisive cost: the staircase reforms "seamlessly, stronger in denial," Elias resumes climbing, and the final image offers recurrence without a legible price that reweights prior material. The flawless die shatters mid-air, but this rupture is immediately undone, deflating the closure unit. The ending gesture—rolling the chipped die and smiling—feels like a reset rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence, falling short of the required closure standard.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (rooftop greenhouse, waxing moon, insomniac painter). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: saffron ink, lost glyphs, and moonlight build density until the final image of strangers lighting windows and Elias sleeping reconfigures the stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): his insomnia retreats, strangers respond, and the night's warmth carries forward with felt cost (months of sleeplessness, doubt now quieted). One slight weakness: the visions cascade without on-page resistance, reducing friction before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes Elara and the grotto early, satisfying orientation, and infers an Accumulative/Textural lens through densely layered imagery. However, the closure—fleeing to an opera house after Veilfall breaks—lacks visible cost; the displaced persons "vanish into legend's embrace" via summary rather than on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The thaw complicates but does not narrow options through protagonist agency, and the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, leaving closure unearned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, though the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than consequential. The closure—Elias collapses, his defiance "eternal"—asserts transformation without showing visible cost that alters tactics or forecloses a legible path on the page. The drive lens wavers between Causal (yoyo mechanism) and Accumulative (image density), never clarifying which governs the ending. The yoyo's reversal mechanism is told rather than dramatized in a sequence of because/therefore moves.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. However, causality fractures: the whispering advisor appears without setup, the dream dictionary's "paradoxical notes" solve the problem they did not create, and Fear's weakness is declared rather than dramatized through prior pressure. The closure unit—Fear dissolving after Elara hurls the clasp—feels mechanical; the cost (lingering luminance, retrieved clasp) contradicts the stated victory. Drive lens reads Causal but because/therefore linkage breaks at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elowen, driftwood orchard, blue hour) and follows a causal sequence: clouds signal storm → debris threatens → Elowen builds xylophone → strikes repel beam. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost: the orchard sails on, euphony lingers, and Elowen's final dream offers conceptual repricing without undeniable pressure or forfeited options. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture, but the ending does not reweight prior material with felt consequence. The beam "glances aside" conveniently, and no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, when anchor after ~200 words of atmospheric setup, creating initial fog that never fully pays off (−0.3). The causal chain from whistle-use to shell-crack to visions is present but abrupt; the crack appears as convenient punishment rather than an earned reversal rooted in prior choice. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (expedition's fate mirrored, watchers revealed as bound to turtles), but the final image ("smiling faintly") asserts menace without on-page cost that alters Elara's options—she staggers away with knowledge, not a foreclosed path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Elias pursues the letter, decodes microscript, finds corroborating ledgers, and resolves to publish. Orientation anchors quickly (historian, station, after petal drop). However, the closure—walking away with the letter, promising future publication—defers the decisive change off-page. The cost (exposing national shame, completing family legacy) is told in future tense rather than enacted now, weakening the on-page closure effect required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story provides spatial anchors (causeway, pavilion, drawbridge) and a loose timeframe (twilight → high tide), but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than causal: Elias wrestles debris, seals notes, and emerges without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending declares transformation ("he had become the archeologist") and describes a future discovery ("Years later, whispers spread") rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing on the page with visible cost. The closure unit reads as summary of what has been done rather than a final image that reweights prior material. Under a Causal or Accumulative lens, the ink running out and the final note placed could function as Charged Poise, but the cost is not legible in the ending beat—he simply "retreated to shore" and "smiled from afar," with stakes dissolved rather than reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: stamp discovery → phosphorescent ink test → vault coordinates → scrolls. Closure lands on-page (truth revealed, insight reborn), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—"dappled resolve fulfilled" tells satisfaction without showing what Elara surrenders or loses. The blackout constraint shapes the ink-test beat but does not reappear to tighten the vault sequence. Lens reads Causal with an Accumulative texture; closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (shadow detachment, luminous grief, ascending/descending paradox) and returns motifs at closure when cranes scatter torment into sparkles. Orientation anchors (Elar, floating isle tea garden, post-shadow detachment) arrive promptly. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the final image reweights grief into "folded echoes" and the cranes wheeling eternal, cost felt in "lighter now" and shadow's outline detaching. However, the middle stretch—gem polishing, tea-induced dream, basilica approach—reads as sequential decoration rather than causally linked tightening; the dream-recording mechanics appear but don't narrow options so much as allow the transformation ritual. One meaningful deepening (grief materialized, then folded) is present, satisfying minimal threshold, but the beats between setup and climax lack because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where within opening lines; the ten-minute breaker window establishes when. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: Elara seals the pool's signature and declares intent to return. Cost is implied (she's "changed—survivor turned sovereign") but the final image does not make the price undeniable on the page; the "changed" claim tells rather than shows a foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (alarms → silence → hunt → seal), satisfying accumulative escalation, but the felt cost at closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when quickly and tracks a causal sequence: pilgrim arrives → chart reveals missing pieces → Elara recalls the chip → drones capture star trails → lever pull ignites frequency. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (both characters feel belonging), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture or tactical change emerges from the frequency's activation. The final "new anomaly" hints at another journey without reweighting what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, cobalt terrace, dusk) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: driftwood fragments accumulate meaning, the watch hand reprises his mother's death, and the final terrace moment reweights his vow. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (tempered regret becomes resolve) with conceptual cost (abandoning his black market trade). However, the cost is asserted in summary ("felt hollow now," "quiet vow") rather than shown through a forfeited client, destroyed record, or another concrete on-page sacrifice. The sieved-hush motif charges atmosphere but does not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off within the scene, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Causal with ritual-framework overlay, but key causality is weak: the drawer pull's symbolic exchange does not earn the shift from war to peace—no on-page resistance, no credible cost that forecloses a path. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness dawns) but the felt price is asserted ("true prisoner freed was her conscience") rather than dramatized. Orientation is present early (parapet, mist, Elara), so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The exchange proceeds without meaningful tightening; Kael's acceptance feels unmotivated by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational (pressure from the journey itself). Orientation anchors (Elias, coastal launch, dusk) arrive early. The closure unit—beaching at the inlet, standing tall, whispering "Heart leads; follow"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), but the cost is announced ("regrets receding," "faith steady") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. The star appearing at the eighteenth pole provides a reversal, but it reads as external validation rather than a choice-driven turn. One meaningful deepening occurs (the star alignment), but causality remains loose—regrets "slither" and "recede" on a tidal metaphor without concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors emerge only after extended abstraction ("sterile haze," "dim apartment," "underground lake" all lack spatial grounding until well past 120 words); apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—Elara's tear and empathy flicker—is asserted rather than shown through a decisive act or stance that forecloses a path. The drive lens wavers between causal (heist → wipe → journey) and accumulative/textural (newspapers, lake glow) without a taught pattern or coherent escalation method. No visible cost: the baseball "mends," but we never see what Jax or Elara forfeit on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elara, the beast whisperer" but not where she is spatially or what immediate goal drives her until the fortune cookie appears mid-story. The closure—transformation into beasts who reunite—lacks visible cost: "reluctance melted," they run together, and the orchard approves. No option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page; this reads as wish-fulfillment rather than Decisive Change or Earned Stasis. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric accumulation vs. causal quest), and the ending does not cohere under either.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal arc: Lirien climbs to the glade seeking lost time, performs a ritual with family objects, discovers the hidden clockwork, and descends with it as "promise rather than curse." However, the central reversal—the saucer crack revealing the heirloom mechanism—arrives without prior setup or earned discovery; the hinge and wax seal are introduced exactly when needed, weakening causality. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (repentance shifts from abstract to embodied in the clockwork) with felt cost (years stolen, blood loss, the "velvet noose" of beauty), satisfying the closure gate under an Accumulative lens. The orientation anchor (who, where, when) lands within the first ~100 words, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure beat—"she pressed the tapestry…with a final stitch pierced the dimensional lock"—is a mechanical completion without visible cost; the "barrier yielded to her pacifist alchemy" is assertion, not dramatized consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, so no penalty there. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (tapestry-building) and Causal (final breach), but neither yields a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The ending spills "golden mist…echoes of laughter" as reward without sacrifice, and "her shadows forever woven into wholeness" tells resolution rather than showing a before/after with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: Elias orchestrates "coincidences" and the celestial alignment frames expectation, but the climax hinges on accidental prophecy fulfillment—coincidence resolving rather than complicating—which violates Situational constraints. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("destitution transmuted… purpose solidified"), but the cost is asserted in summary ("transformation's weave was coincidence orchestrated in whispers") without a visible choice or forfeiture on the page. The prophecy mechanism is introduced late ("ancient lore" appears only at the climax) and conveniently solves the problem it did not help create, breaking causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, causality remains weak: the blackout enables Elara's plan but she faces no on-page reversal or tightening—allies appear on cue, the quill holder unlocks every mechanism without friction, and dawn nears with revolution "simmering" rather than landing a decisive change. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("the cradle of sparks had kindled true") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, injury, or relationship severed that makes a before/after legible with felt price. Under a situational or accumulative lens, pressure should crystallize stance or a pattern should break with cost; neither occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it: density increases through the rock-placing sequence, building toward the mandala's completion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's curse transmutes to gift, "promise kept in eternal flow," with the cost legible in his years of solitary seeking and his wife's absence. One minor causality slip: the dust's power to "bend foresight into clarity" is asserted but the mechanics of that transformation remain opaque, slightly weakening the hinge between escalation and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece lacks on-page closure: Elias begins awaiting revelation, receives an envelope, writes a reply, and exits unchanged in stance or options—no decisive change, no renunciation with cost, no crystallized reconfiguration. The vigil "in pause" is referenced but never dramatically enacted; the timer counts down but triggers no turn in knowledge or tactics. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive quickly, but causality is ornamental: the envelope appears by coincidence, its contents inspire Elias to write more poetry (which he was already doing), and he departs with his mission unaltered. Under any inferred lens, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and what the duel stakes mean emerge slowly through abstract philosophizing. The "hidden overture" arrives via summary decipherment rather than dramatized discovery that narrows options. Closure attempts Charged Poise (alliance forming) but the cost is invisible: no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The causal chain from sundial angles to alliance lacks concrete intermediary steps; the reader cannot trace why this particular discovery compels Lang's yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (blooming resistance through repeated images of rust, stars, sorting), but the closure—"luminous fracture shone eternal"—restates the opening's mood without reweighting prior material or legible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty. The coffee tin's seeds and final poem gesture toward Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract ("From anarchy's bloom, we rebuild the sky") rather than felt on the page. Multiple micro-reversals (guards pass indifferently, warden rages, gatherings form) accumulate without a single decisive tightening that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (station, pianist, arbor, cloudsea) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid: discovery of the film reel → decoding hidden map → navigating arbor → reaching refuge. However, closure collapses into summary: "Tides hushed, compasses glowed steady… her voice, unplanned, eternal" tells the transformation rather than showing a decisive on-page moment with legible cost. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (clear anchors), but the Cost proof test fails—no single sentence at closure demonstrates what Elias gave up or what changed options moving forward. The clock "chiming once, clear and true" is asserted magic, not earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (dream-library imagery layering toward a thematic reconfiguration), but the closure lacks felt cost—the Guardian wakes, memory surges back, villagers hum, done. The orientation is clear early (Elara, ridge, pre-monsoon). One tightening occurs when she enters the dreamscape, but the resolution is delivered by the Guardian's cooperation rather than Elara's sacrifice or irreversible choice. Cost is gestured at ("had she truly anchored it, or merely delayed") but remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture is visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: who Elara is, where the islet sits, and when "after the severance" occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering −0.4 in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural (mist, lace, compass imagery), but no causal turn or tightening forecloses a path with on-page cost—Elara's "diffusing" of apologies and the compass revealing cerulean occur without friction or stakes narrowing. The ending summary ("Cerulean regret had found its true shade—not loss, but luminous forgiveness unspoken") tells closure rather than landing it through image or action. Cost is asserted, not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from secret to revelations to change. Closure is a decisive change (Elara's resolve to thread nuance) with felt cost legible in the garden's stirring and her awakened heart. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of certainty vs. nuance shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the staircase reforms, foreclosing escape but reweighting his understanding. The Hybrid drive lens holds, with causal proof attempts and accumulative texture culminating in the rupture; orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias sleeps, banishing insomnia, with cost felt in the city's awakened kindness. The accumulative/textural lens holds through visions building to climax, and orientation is anchored early. Persistent constraint of insomnia shapes tactics, and the final image reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the group flees the grotto, reconfiguring toward rebirth under a hybrid drive lens that blends causal (thaw forces escape) and textural elements.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost (Elias's body as a husk); the causal lens holds tightly from vow to reversal, with the hunger stone and yoyo as persistent constraints. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkages from resuscitation to unbosoming and Fear's defeat. Closure is a decisive change with cost (lingering allure), and orientation is anchored early. The advisor's reveal as Fear's echo is slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with decisive change: the storm is repelled, and safe passage is achieved, with cost felt as Elowen slumps. Causal lens holds tightly from cloud interpretation to dubbing crescendo. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Elias transforming the pavilion and seeding legacy, cost legible in his surfaced "lungs aflame." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The future diver finding parchments charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands decisively with Elara's understanding reconfigured and cost legible in "truth settled over her like sediment"; causal lens holds tightly from stamp discovery to vault revelation. Orientation is immediate, and the blackout persistently constrains tactics, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (lighter after cranes release), under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without contradiction, with the basilica and gems shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara seals the crystal, changing from survivor to sovereign with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong, driven by her past and experiments, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the frequency mends both characters, and the cost is legible in Elara's resolved isolation and the pilgrim's softened expression.

Orientation is anchored early in the observatory at dusk, and the structure is a single scene with a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the vow to rebuild genuine lines; causal lens holds tightly from guilt-driven shore visit to revelatory driftwood finds. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint of withheld truth shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: prisoners are freed and the drawer pull is exchanged, symbolizing peace under a causal lens. Cost is legible in Elara's conscience and the symbolic act. The persistent constraint of past deception shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias finds redemption, with cost legible in his tears and whispered resolution. The causal lens holds strong, driven by his actions and regrets, and orientation is clear early, anchoring who, where, and when without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands on-page with felt cost as Elara's tear reconfigures their relationship, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The baseball and newspaper clues create because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words. The persistent constraint of the baseball shapes tactics and the final image, charging the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a decisive change—Elara's metamorphosis and reunion with Thorne—under a causal lens, and cost is legible in her physical transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the plot advances through because/therefore linkages from the fortune cookie to the rite. The phoenix's rise as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, though the resolution leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lirien integrates the clockwork, syncing with her daughter's breath, and cost is legible in "tears blurred the cards." The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with the saucer crack as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent in a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with cost (becoming lighter and stepping forward) under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of pacifism shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens; the prophecy fulfillment and Elias's accidental release of bugs carry felt cost, but minor causality in village convergence relies on orchestrated coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change—the revolution ignites—and cost is legible in the blackout's persistence and risk taken. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, e.g., the sundial decoding leads to crystal retrieval and network activation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Kael's understanding resolving the lingering promise and transforming his curse.

Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity through pattern buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's changed perspective on scars) under a Causal lens, cost legible in his realization. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a decisive change from rivalry to alliance, landed on-page with cost (shattered pane, yielded duel). Causal lens holds strong: the sundial code directly alters tactics and stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the coded message shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages: meeting Mira leads to rebuilding, seeding, and rebellion. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library pulses alive with blooming resistance, cost legible in the "rust and stars" image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. No teleporting props or outline sequencing; stakes face concrete tests.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages: the reel discovery leads to the map and journey. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as the clock chimes and Lira's whisper echoes, reconfiguring his stance from loss to legacy. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost (doubt and seed crumbling), under a consistent causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages, with the persistent constraint of doubt shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara's acceptance of regret. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: discovery of the dust → experiments on leaf and mirrors → application to data → publication and return to the greenhouse, with a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis closure. Causality holds within the story’s speculative rules, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent. The rapid, summary-like leap from improvised greenhouse experiments to peer-reviewed publication and acclaim feels compressed and low-friction, softening the sense of cost or difficulty. Still, the before/after in her stance and circumstances is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: attack → survival → retracing via frost → discovery of secondary ledger → confrontation → transformation of the ledger into art. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from endangered artisan to self-aware guardian with a materially changed relationship to the ledger and her work. Some key beats are compressed—especially the confrontation with the surviving smugglers and the implications of the “vast network”—which reduces felt difficulty and on-page cost. Still, the hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds together cleanly without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is strong: Elara’s arrival with the tuning forks → discovery of heat-mapping → communal experiment → Kai’s outburst cracks the pane and endangers the lily → Elara uses his buried love to mend and re-harmonize the space. Orientation is clear early on; we always know where we are and what the immediate stakes are. Closure lands as a decisive change in the conservatory’s state and in how silence is experienced, with a concrete before/after. The only limitation is that the “world outside” remains more gestural than structurally tied into the on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the package arrives → the lens recalls the legend → Elias formulates a plan → he installs shards in impossible spaces → the signals falter → the final shard pulls him into the light. Closure is decisive and on-page: he becomes the beacon that ends the haunting, at the cost of his own rest. The structure is essentially one continuous pressured arc with no orientation issues and a satisfying climactic cadence. A minor deepening of one intermediate complication or setback would further sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: secret gifts → Mira’s recognition of their potential → persuasion campaign → organized runs → formal declaration of the Shadow Harvest → time jump affirming continuity. The story leans heavily on summary/montage (“Weeks passed…”) instead of dramatizing key pressure beats, especially the community’s internal turning point. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the community recasts itself from passive recipients to active, anonymous givers at cost. The sanctions and enforcers remain background pressure rather than a fully exploited on-page obstacle, which softens the sense of concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: past-life memory → following sparks → finding Mira → using the improvised apparatus → healing and insight, all within one continuous scene. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—Elias reconceives where “unused love” is stored—linked directly to the healing act. The main weakness is that the central problem (Mira’s injury and the “blockage”) yields too smoothly to his first attempt, with no failed pass, complication, or hard choice to tighten structure. Still, the scene feels complete and coherently organized under a causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric skin: garden → torment via photographs → discovery of fragment → experiments that intensify the trap → disintegration that breaks it. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/what’s wrong) despite the dreamy register, and the story holds a single POV and throughline. Closure lands decisively: the fragment’s destruction and the photographs’ dissolution end the retrocognitive imprisonment at a visible cost. The only limitation is that the “method” of geometric manipulation skirts the edge of abstraction, though not enough to break logic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Wall falls → wardens arrive → puzzle decoding → hatch → vault → escape into the drylands. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds under a clear causal lens. Closure is a decisive change—Elara shifts from captive to free carrier of seeds—with the cost and consequences implied rather than deeply dramatized. Some beats (especially the puzzle solution and quick neutralizing of “elite” Wardens) feel a bit convenient, slightly softening the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal arc is clean: betrayal → obsession → harvesting absences → forging → imprinting → testing → reoriented mission, all within a single continuous sequence. Closure is solid—a decisive change and conceptual repricing when he captures and reframes the sound of trust breaking. Structure is straightforward but effective; stakes and goal never drift. It could reach higher with one sharper setback or on-page risk that complicates the forging process beyond exertion and time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: bouquet tip → infiltration → discovery of hidden portrait → accidental jar spill → revelation → literal ear-to-canvas moment → escape and train epilogue. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (external heist spine plus accumulative symbolic deepening), and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of her life’s work with an on-page decision to change stance. Stakes are mostly internal; external danger (guards, possible trap) is gestured at rather than really complicating tactics or forcing trade-offs. Structure (station scene then train shard) is coherent and proportionate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: arrive → ignite furnace → craft spheres → commit to stay, with the bookmark as causal seed and the finished domes as closure image. The drive lens reads as accumulative/causal hybrid, and the final commitment is on the page with a before/after. Yet pressure and complication are minimal; the story progresses smoothly without any meaningful snag or uncertainty in the outcome. Closure works, but the path there lacks structural tension or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal spine is clear: revelation → flight to remembered site → discovery via shell/cast → confrontation on cliff → decisive shove. Closure exists (Harlan falls; Elara repositions her fear), with evident cost risked in her leap. However, the climax is marred by visible drafting artifacts (“No—word count overrun… Actually: … But precisely:”), which propose contradictory resolutions (poison aerosol vs. shove) and muddy the exact mechanics of how she wins. This line-level confusion undercuts structural cleanliness and slightly blurs the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: storm → arrival → request → demonstration → partial resolution with a map fragment. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from outside tempest to interior silences to a charged final image forms a recognizable arc, and there is a legible closure in the shared project against the night. However, the stakes remain mostly conceptual and low-cost, and the meta-textual intrusion about word count (“742—adjusted flow…”) briefly breaks immersion and structural integrity. The closure holds, but the sense of a before/after with cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative loop structure is clean: each violin-triggered loop adds a layer of understanding and reweights the central question. Causality under the textural lens holds—play → loop → new insight—building to the realization that thoughts arise from the loops themselves. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his existence and labor are reinterpreted, with the violin’s destruction and stabilized timeline marking cost and change. Stakes and cost remain largely conceptual, so the structure is elegant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias’s long-term observation and eavesdropping motivate his plan; the placement of tickets and lens triggers Mira’s engagement; her interaction with them produces the final bridge between them. The story maintains a single continuous scene with a clear before/after in her stance toward trust, and the closure (shared silence, ticket exchange, ledger closing “forever on solitude”) is legible. The cost—relinquishing her entrenched mistrust and his solitude—is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply felt. As a result, the structure works, but the change feels somewhat frictionless for a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: council threatens demolition → Elias stages a demonstration → the polishing ritual appears to alter luck readings → the auditors relent. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens (causal with a conceptual repricing at the end) holds. Closure lands: the maze’s fate shifts, the rules of luck are reinterpreted, and Elias’s methods are validated, though the victory comes a bit quickly once the scanner jumps, softening the sense of price. Structural choices are solid and immediate-publishable but not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain (obsession → building the nexus → station crisis forcing integration → activation → proof) is legible and coherent, and the piece maintains a single scene through twilight activation to aftermath. The closure is a conceptual repricing: time is redefined for everyone on station, but the cost and practical implications of that shift remain mostly gestured at. Structural slips appear when the narrative breaks frame into meta-commentary about word count and “no meta,” which momentarily ruptures immersion and weakens the ending’s authority. Overall, the drive lens reads as Causal with a strong conceptual accent, but the climax resolves too easily for the magnitude of the claimed stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: dreams → return to pit → discovery of program → intentional disruption → map → hidden score → escape and commitment to perform. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a mild accumulative texture, and the closure—Elias obtaining the score and beginning secret rehearsals—is on-page and legible. Cost exists (the opera house physically damaged, alarms, rising water) but is kept at a safe distance from Elias, muting impact. Structurally it holds together as a single, escalating night plus brief coda, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from fever breaking → ritual with the illustration → realization of the cartographer’s death → acceptance of ongoing burden. Causality is intact and legible; each step arises organically from the previous one (the berry leads to fever, which leads to clarity, which leads to re-evaluating her methods). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she cannot undo the death, but she consciously accepts carrying the accumulated weight instead of imagining it can be “lifted.” The main limitation is that the story’s engine is largely reflective and inward, so the structural arc feels more contemplative than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: exploration → discovery of the wheel and beads → radio pattern → confession → physical act of turning the valve → emergence into moonlight with changed stance. Closure is a decisive change and conceptual repricing: he reframes “ghosts” as psychic residue and gains a costly self-knowledge. The radio-psychic device borders on convenient exposition, with callers neatly supplying key backstory, but it still functions as a structured investigative method rather than a pure info dump. The single continuous scene and temporal flow are clear and well-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the swan → decoding it as method → burrowing → arrival and immersion in the refuge, culminating in a stable new mode of existence. The piece reads under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he relocates his vigil into “regenerative silence” with a clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and internal, and no serious complication resists him en route, so escalation is gentle rather than taut. Still, the structure is coherent and self-contained with no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: hike to the ridge → music under the eclipse → revelation and transfer of the locket → Lila’s verbal and emotional opening. The single-scene structure is coherent, and the eclipse’s progression provides a natural temporal spine and tightening. Closure is solidly on the page: Lila’s first words and active engagement with the roots mark a decisive before/after with clear emotional cost (Elias giving up the locket, re-exposing his grief). The drive lens reads primarily causal with some accumulative lyricism, and it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: probing → discovery of diaries → revelation of the tapestry’s meaning → decision to mount it → closing image of him listening again. Causality is clean at this scale, and the closure functions as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when he reframes the axis as chronicle rather than curse. Stakes remain inward and conceptual, so the sense of decisive narrowing is soft, but there is a clear before/after in his understanding and role. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence; no disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causality is clean: loose board → specs → plan with doctored cookies and beam → spies’ arrival → trap → authorities’ intervention. The closure (Elias exposed as a new kind of actor in town politics) is on-page and legible with a clear before/after. However, key beats feel convenient and under-contested: the specs appear just when needed, his improvised microdot-cookies work flawlessly, the spies are credulous, and patrol cutters materialize the moment he signals. These conveniences reduce the sense of earned difficulty and cost in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story is a single, coherent scene with a clear before/after: an unraveling anchor under possession, then a steadied anchor with the possession thwarted. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is strong—each new rhetorical device and silence-loop incrementally weakens the shadow and tightens the atmosphere. Closure lands on-page via a Conceptual Repricing: stillness is redefined as enduring, active stasis rather than fragile illusion. The cost is present but relatively soft (palette emptied, eternal silence, exposed assumptions) rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: orientation is swift, the ritual on the ice builds in stages, and the collapse with the shell cradled provides a clear before/after reconfiguration of her homesickness. Causality is simple but sound—memory-mapping → conducting → apparition of listeners → emotional resolution. Closure works as an Earned Stasis/RR: she has orchestrated her past into something ongoing, and the future fortunes are plausibly reweighted. The main limitation is that the path contains no serious reversals or complications; pressure deepens texturally rather than structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Who/where/when orient cleanly: Elias above the glowing viaduct post-storm, tablet in hand, time frozen. Causality is coherent: he activates the runes → labyrinth of timelines opens → he traverses alternates → confronts doppelganger → integrates and exits as time resumes. Closure—a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration—is on-page, with the labyrinth collapsing and him landing grounded-within. The main weakness is that the journey’s middle beats compress into summary (“timelines splintered wildly…”) so escalation through action rather than recitation is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the relic → experimental play → revelation of the filament → communal sharing → Elara’s regained feeling, with each step causally linked. The inferred lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where silence is repriced as “music’s truest note”—lands clearly. Costs (painful memories, tears) are present but relatively gentle; nothing truly resists Elara’s project once the phonograph works, which keeps the arc emotionally satisfying but slightly low-pressure. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the outset and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal throughline—followed home → pigeon/message → cross-check with logs → inference about a manipulative rogue zone → decision to privately document—is clear and single-scene coherent. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses careful, solitary verification rather than evacuation or reporting, but the practical consequences remain mostly conceptual. The major weakness is the leap from micro-vortices and a single pigeon to “storms weaponized carrier pigeons as bait,” which feels under-evidenced at this length. That inferential jump slightly undercuts the sense of rigor the piece itself values.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → approach → UV revelation → flower’s full opening → emotional and conceptual resolution, all causally linked. Closure is solidly on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with the same objects but a transformed understanding and stance toward his grief. Stakes and time-frame are clear, with the nightshade’s imminent “final metamorphosis” anchoring the live clock. There are no causality breaks; the only limitation is that external plot demand is modest, mostly in service of the interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean, accumulative structure: introduction of beings/grotto/rope → layered revelations about time → binary fork → synthesis choice and transformation. Causality is coherent under a lyric lens; each “layer” genuinely advances the stakes and options, and the rope’s evolving state ties the beats together. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (his fusion into conduit) and Conceptual Repricing (choice as illusion, time embracing frays) with at least a conceptual cost. The only limiter is that the danger/cost of fusion never becomes fully concrete, so the climactic choice feels slightly safe.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: the daily collecting of sound fragments culminates in the bonfire gathering and the decisive act of unbinding, after which the hush “cracks” and the world’s soundscape subtly reconfigures. Causality is stable under a textural lens—each step (collect → convene → play → share personal fragment) meaningfully deepens the same drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: tradition is reestablished, and the hush now coexists with renewed murmur. The cost and stakes are mostly emotional and conceptual but legible and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Mira returns for the final infusion, the transformation escalates, and Elias completes it by tuning and administering the half-truth, then drawing off her excess grief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the transformation is sealed, she departs altered, he chooses his habitual aloofness. Cost is implied (Mira’s human grief becomes “eternal yet inert”; Elias buries his own stirrings) but not deeply dramatized as loss in the final beats. Structure is otherwise solid, single-scene and legible, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: mistaken envelope → locket revelation → visit to Mira → mutual recognition → plan for an ongoing bond. The drive lens is largely causal with a situational coincidence at the start, and the story does land a clear closure beat. However, the heavy reliance on coincidence (same locket, same ship, same anonymous benefactor) and the absence of any serious obstacle flatten structural tension. The closure carries only a conceptual cost—no option truly foreclosed—so the before/after line is gentle rather than forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the recurring tag prompts a search, the group coheres in the process, and the arbor discovery plus sculpture and dedication provide a legible closure beat. Causality is intact—each step (tag → search → group formation → arbor → sculpture) follows naturally. The closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the same ache is reweighted as shared rather than solitary. That said, the path is frictionless; no beat seriously complicates or threatens the goal, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: desire for the Echo Cradle → timed opportunity with the giant’s nap → obstacle of time sculptures → solution via pendant and cadence insight → arrival and capture of the Cradle. Closure is solid—she reaches her goal, the giant stirs as a price for borrowed time, and the art preserves what the world may lose. That said, the Time Sculptor remains entirely offstage and the giant never becomes an active on-page force, so the climax feels a touch procedural rather than perilous. Structure is elegant and coherent, but escalation could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene arc: arrival → ritual preparation → activation → vision → reconfigured stance, with each step causally motivated. The closure unit is a conceptual repricing of ambiguous loss, as Thorne reframes it from endpoint to pivot and commits to continued pursuit; the cost is his acceptance that full restoration is not (yet) achievable. Structure is linear and legible, with no orientation issues and a consistent hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The main limitation is that the climax feels more like an elegant deepening than a truly decisive narrowing of options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: outage → hearing the sob → preparing and hiding the cache → tape-triggered memory → woman’s discovery → revelation; causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens. The tape fragment serves as a hinge that reconfigures past and present, credibly motivating his decision to become visible. Closure lands clearly when he steps out and is seen, with the power coming back as a framing cadence. The main weakness is the heavy coincidence of *this* exact fragment appearing here, which reads more mythic than earned, slightly softening the causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm season → discovery of the leaf → tea brewing → bodily changes → trellis-rooting → full metamorphosis, with no major logic gaps. Structure is linear and cohesive, fitting a single-scene arc with one main transition (greenhouse back to trellis). Closure lands clearly as a decisive change with a visible price: Elias irreversibly becomes the nursery’s rooted heart. The main limitation is some mid-story redundancy around the same choice (release control vs reluctance) rather than additional turns or complications.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: rain → trails → hidden altar/brooch → Mira’s arrival/explanation → exchange → return to painting, with closure as a reconfigured relationship to his work and the island. Causality is solid and easy to follow, and the single scene window (with a return to the shack) fits the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after in Elias’s purpose is clear and comes with the cost of remaining in his “prison” with new obligations to meaning. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat low-tension, which limits the structural intensity despite the elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: arrival → pearl discovery → awakening forces → attempted possession → Elara’s acceptance → transfer of the pearl. Closure qualifies as a Decisive Change: Elara becomes inhabited and then passes the empowered object to Thorne, shifting the story’s global options. Cost is implied (her body as vessel, his burden of “seed”) but not fully felt, and escalation leans on narration of inevitability rather than on-page dilemmas. Structure is straightforward, single scene, with no orientation issues or broken set-ups, but the climax resolves smoothly without a genuine hitch.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: harbor setup → discovery of the valve → gathering crowd → three staggered blasts culminating in a communal reframing of exile. Causality is solid in an accumulative/lyric way, and the three-interval pattern gives a clear spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the community now “navigates forward,” but the cost is light and no option feels meaningfully foreclosed. Some middle exposition about past exile waves is more told than dramatized, slightly flattening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalies → grate → stairs → ticket → tunnel → archway → train → fortress → return, and the closure (he reaches the fortress, is redefined by it, then chooses to return) lands on the page. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with some accumulative lyricism, and the story mostly honors that. The main weakness is that each step opens with minimal resistance or complication, so the climax and return loop feel almost too smooth, muting the sense of cost in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: fisherman brings tile → Elara investigates → entangled memories activate → she chooses transcription and public sharing, leading to communal solace. Structure is essentially linear with accumulative lyricism, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of her role and beliefs, with a visible cost in vulnerability and altered worldview. Some key beats—especially the memory-flash sequence—are compressed into summary rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts immediacy. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and satisfying under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: boredom → contact with the fragment → curse/dimensional awareness → discovery of mutiny → deliberate amplification via magnetic fields → cataclysm → transfiguration beyond dimensions. The drive lens reads predominantly causal with some accumulative lyricism, and closure is a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (eternity reconfigured as “endless novelty”). Cost is legible in his goodbye to immortality’s stasis and the destruction/reformation of the escondite. Structural slips are minimal; the story maintains a single throughline without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Eli enters, discovers the ink pot, learns its property, undergoes a mental shift, calculates the guard pattern, and breaches at the precise moment, achieving a decisive change in circumstance. Orientation (who/where/what now) is clear very early despite the lush prose, and the single-scene structure fits the length. The closure beat—door breach and escape toward asylum—lands with a concrete before/after, though cost and complication are relatively light. Some elements (e.g., instant comprehension of complex equations) skate close to convenience but stay within the story’s alchemical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: daily ritual → pattern of remote refractions → disruption when the hum pulls in the town’s catastrophe → choice to record truth and create the gold-leaf volume → resurrection. Causality is legible within the story’s magical logic; the lamp’s hum and notepad work as a consistent engine rather than a late-breaking device. Closure is decisive and on the page (figures emerging from frost, town voices returning), with the cost framed as the exhaustion of his notepad and the surrender of his invented-only stance. The piece remains focused on one throughline without stray subplots.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure—tide-cycles of overheard stories culminating in the physical label and revelation of sabotage—works cleanly and feels intentional. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: collecting fragments → layered visions → discovery of the label → reinterpretation of their “death.” Closure is a clear conceptual repricing of their history with a plausible personal cost. The only limitation is that the external stakes stay largely atmospheric rather than sharply tested in specific risky choices.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climb → observatory ritual → hums/memories → decoded riddle → descent. Causality within the magical frame is coherent—shell to cello to voices to realization—and closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing of myth vs. truth. The “universal riddle” is resolved on the page with a before/after stance that is legible and thematically integrated. The only brake on a higher score is that external stakes and costs are minimal, so the decisive change, while clear, feels relatively low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent causal chain: threat of privatization → discovery of contracts → decision to encode resistance in graffiti → community reorganization and temporary stalling of developers. Structurally, though, it reads more like a compressed outline than a fully dramatized sequence, with major turns (e.g., “By dawn, the community had reorganized”) summarized rather than staged. Closure is present—Aquafeste has been reconfigured and Elara’s stance has shifted—but the price of this victory is largely implied rather than concretely dramatized. The drive lens feels primarily causal with an accumulative, montage-like texture, but escalation never quite tightens into a single, unavoidable crunch point.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: climb → discovery → oxygen problem → improvised chemical SOS → waiting through dawn → photo and rescue → log revelation, with no major logic breaks. The story lands a coherent closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing) when the grain’s micro-etchings reframe it as the nightwatch’s final log, tying back to the opening premise. That said, the tension around “outlasting until dawn” is somewhat undercut by how smoothly the chemical system and rescue work, so cost at closure feels modest rather than biting. Structure is linear and controlled, but not yet at the “flawless, can’t-cut-a-line” level for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged drone → brought to Elias → diagnostic via water/refraction and feedback → polymer patch → test and successful launch as the anchor lifts. The ticking clock of the ship’s departure provides a clear through-line and the scene stays in one coherent window with no orientation issues. Closure lands via a successful repair timed to the anchor breaking free plus Elias’s settled role as a stationary guide, which functions as a modest resonant reconfiguration. The main limitation is that the outcome never feels seriously in doubt and the cost is relatively soft, more conceptual than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: falcon returns → vellum with runes → phrasebook translation → condensation pattern confirmation → decision to depart. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main tightening as multiple clues converge on the same locus. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he leaves safety with a clear, heightened sense of what’s at stake, even if the external journey is off-page. The cost of leaving remains somewhat conceptual rather than dramatized through a harder choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: Elias arrives, initiates the tuning, builds the rhythm, and the town revives—causality is easy to follow. Closure is decisive (ghost town to living town) but the cost and constraints on achieving it are underdeveloped, making the arc feel almost frictionless. The backstory of Perivale’s collapse is woven in without derailing the present, though it edges toward summary. Overall, it’s coherent and complete but lacks a meaningful complication or turn that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: distress signal → exploration → discovery of vial → emotional stabilization → unsnarling the hush → capture → rescue. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a late but clear closure where her options reconfigure once she claims the orb and activates the beacon. Cost is legible via the ticking oxygen and her deliberate choice to keep working under that constraint. The rescue’s relative ease slightly undercuts the sense that capture of the hush forces a permanent trade-off, keeping this out of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: Elias descends, retrieves the lattice, finds the hidden door, binds shades, confronts his father’s spirit, completes the story-threading, then returns topside in a new equilibrium of hush. Structure is cleanly linear with one clear deepening beat at the father’s appearance and the core chamber. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he has achieved his goal “before they find the bodies,” with an implied but not yet paid cost. The main limitation is that no on-page event meaningfully threatens his success; the path feels foregone rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: bead → hauntings → escalating contact/poisoning → transcendence/death, with a clear before/after in Elias’s mortal vs. spectral state. The closure unit is solidly on the page: his collapse and spirit joining her across the veil, with the bead going inert and the greenhouse reconfigured as their eternal sanctuary. Structure is essentially linear with lyric repetition, and while Elias is somewhat passive, the sequence of events and costs is legible and earned. The reincarnation backstory is integrated enough not to feel like a late patch.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: storm → ruined village → decision to enter the labyrinth → sleepwalking sewing sequence → dawn reconfiguration of the world. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure—a new map and dissolved precedents—lands clearly on the page. However, the risk of becoming one of “the lost” remains mostly theoretical; the narrative never tightens options or makes the danger bite in real time. The result is a satisfying conceptual arc that lacks some lived tension and concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: return → deeper wandering → tomb discovery → excavation → sundial reconstruction → renewed faith, with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Time jumps (“third day,” “tenth day,” “fourteenth sunset”) are legible and unify the piece as a single extended endeavor. However, escalation is fairly smooth and untroubled—no significant complications or reversals challenge the project once it begins. Closure lands, but the path there feels low-friction for venue-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative frame: arrive, prepare the code, embed it, ready the letter, and approach the chute. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first line, and the action tracks logically. Closure functions as a quiet Charged Poise: she commits to sending the analog-coded secrets into a hostile system, with risk and meaning reweighted by the final image. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; we’re told the danger of “shadowy enforcers” but never see pressure truly close in, which keeps the turn from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: anomalous thread → recognition of forged starlogs → deduction of coup → smuggling the corrected chart to the queen. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when are all clear) and the piece holds a single, coherent scene frame. Closure lands as a quiet earned stasis/charged poise: Elara has done what she can before the off-page coup and returns to work. However, the decisive change and its cost stay mostly conceptual and off-stage (no direct consequence or counter-pressure appears on the page), which blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is coherent: Elara enters the labyrinth to reach a key “moment before deciding,” performs evocations that first partially fail (vision of Thorne turning away) and then succeed (his manifestation), leading to a clear before/after in their relationship. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural bias: ritual repetitions and vivid set-pieces build to the reunion. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration—regret reweighted into mutual forgiveness—but the obstacles feel relatively soft, with the spirits ultimately facilitating rather than pushing back. The emotional cost is mostly backdated (years of regret) rather than strongly tested in the present, which keeps this just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that accumulates through the decoding of the cast, culminating in the untying of the string and discovery of the drawing. Causality is coherent in an accumulative/lyric way—each deciphered phrase deepens the emotional situation rather than advancing a concrete external plot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to her own grief and to Kael’s fears is reweighted in the final vow. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, but the before/after of her stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: arrival → discovery of fresco → use of light tool → knowledge network vision → public display → quiet afterglow, with no major logic gaps. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, and the ending does provide a resonant reconfiguration in which her relationship to joy and the orchard shifts. However, the structure offers only one real turn (from private search to communal revelation), and the cost of that shift is minimal. The closure is legible and satisfying but not especially tense or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a single dilated pause between question and reply—holds cleanly and the causal chain is legible: Lena’s challenge → Elias’s choice to use the nickel → the layered awakening → joint commitment at the end. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the garden is reweighted in Lena’s mind and the relationship reconfigured into collaboration. The scene obeys its own temporal conceit and returns satisfyingly to “real time” with Elias’s simple answer. Stakes remain modest and largely internal, but the progression is coherent and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure reads as an accumulative, near-mosaic build that coheres under a single causal arc: Elias learns of the Whisperers → gardens as code → Voss’s greenhouse and the gourd’s awakening → mass dissemination and warp. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: thought taxation is rendered obsolete by a self-propagating, untaxable language-system, with clear before/after. However, many turns are summarized rather than dramatized (e.g., “rebels flooding gates,” “patterns spread beyond gardens”), softening the sense of discrete, costly beats. The cost of confronting the Bureau is more implied than concretely felt in a specific choice or sacrifice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: discovery → interpretation → ritual → sleep forms a clear before/after with cost (surrendering the vigil and identity forged in pain). Causality holds under a textural lens: the postcard’s appearance leads to a decision and then a rite that culminates in rest. The closure beat (postcard ensconced, lullabies fading, Elowen sleeping) lands solidly as a Decisive Change. The extended coda of repetitious affirmations after the decisive act slightly diffuses structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure of moving wing-to-wing with a repeated ritual is clear and causally coherent: find tube → test it → escalate stakes as crack widens → shatter at climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the extinct feelings and names are preserved at visible cost (loss of the tool) and with a conceptual before/after for Elara’s grief. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, with each wing adding weight rather than introducing new plot vectors. The main limitation is that transitions between wings are somewhat summarized, slightly flattening the sense of on-page turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the ink well → decision to use it despite prior disaster → sequence of promises that progressively unlock the scroll and reveal truths → Thorne’s shift and renewed commitment. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a light accumulative texture, and closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: their relationship is reweighted, paths still diverge but no longer mean separation. However, cost is underplayed; the threat of lexical curses and guardian wraiths never truly bites, so the risk feels more declared than tested. Structure is otherwise tight and linear within one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tremors and debates lead Elias to the amphitheater, the envelope and adhesive analysis unlock the ancestral pact, which then motivates a redesign and public test that resolves the external conflict. Closure lands firmly with a concrete new system and social realignment, plus a charged final image of ongoing vigilance. The main structural weakness is convenience—the perfectly targeted letter and its deciphering arrive as a somewhat tidy deus ex machina rather than pressure born purely of present struggle. Still, for this length, the drive lens (causal with thematic coloration) holds and the before/after is legible with some conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: Elias’s meteorite project and myth-making lead him to Lila, his deception is exposed, he chooses honesty, and the relationship reforms and carries through to a quiet but definite closure in his death and her continuing the work. The piece uses a compressed, accumulative structure over months/years, but transitions (“Weeks bloomed…”, “Months later…”, “The end came softly…”) keep orientation intact. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the drive to preserve echoes moves from his solitary, fraudulent control to a shared, honest stewardship through Lila, with on-page cost in the risk and loss of his illusions. The last death beat is a touch summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts but does not break the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: grain → logbook → understanding of codes → hidden compass → prism alignment → crossing to the maze and reunion. The piece reads as Hybrid (causal with strong accumulative lyricism) and lands a clear closure beat when she crosses the threshold having redefined “necessary distances.” Cost is somewhat soft—“lose the light” never concretely cashes out—so the climax feels more like a graceful completion than a pressured risk. Structure is otherwise tight for the length, with no orientation problems.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: arrival → discovery of feather → meeting Theo → observatory vigil → fireflies and shared realization, with a clear before/after in Elara’s sense of belonging. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure (shared breath/light reconfiguring her premise of belonging) lands on-page. However, escalation is gentle and largely atmospheric; the story never truly corners the characters into a pressured choice. Causality holds, but the turns feel more like graceful slides than pressured beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: cave + task → problem with missing pieces → bird and seeds → deciphering → conceptual closure. Causality is coherent and legible under a textural lens, and the closure—reframing lost paths as unrooted seeds—lands clearly with a before/after in her understanding. The cost (accepting her own lost path as irrecoverable) is present but somewhat soft, cushioned by the lyrical tone. The bird’s arrival is convenient but acceptable in this mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—Jasper plans → throws the pieces “with physicist’s precision” → the bishop reaches Elara → she connects with the man → Jasper exits—is clean and legible. The piece lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the arcade’s monotony is “forever subtly altered” by the new creative alliance. Causality veers toward convenience (his near-omniscient reading of Elara, flawless prediction of wind and crowds), but it doesn’t break plausibility within the slightly heightened tone. Structure is tight for one continuous scene; no orientation or lens ambiguity penalty is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: exile → anchoring by the speck → deciphering cosmic gaps → release → flight to Kai → inscription, with a clear before/after in her status. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—she abandons solitary exile to bind herself to Kai, and the speck’s power is transmuted into verse. However, the central problem (the anchor) resolves relatively quickly once the “observing gaps” method appears, with limited sense of risk, time pressure, or potential failure. Structure remains coherent and legible, but the central obstacle never feels close to unresolvable in a way that would fully satisfy top-tier publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: workshop → descent to atrium → communion → vision of storm and fractures → renewed resolve. Causality is coherent under the lyric, ritual frame, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias emerges with a clarified stance before the coming shift. The main limitation is that the “storm” and community rifts remain entirely offstage, so the narrative drive leans heavily on foreboding rather than on concrete turns. Still, the before/after in his knowledge and intention is legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal line from solitary walk → encounter with Lena → story-sharing → mutual descent. Reflection is anchored to concrete triggers (the box, the locket, the girl, the distant fire) and consistently tilts the present interaction rather than floating free. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’ long-held pain crystallizes into guidance that Lena explicitly adopts, with the cost of vulnerability and her unresolved loss still felt. The drive reads as Hybrid (causal spine with lyric overlay) and holds comfortably through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: each trial balloon and pattern refines the central ritual toward a conceptual closure where hope’s equations are rewritten. Causality is internally coherent—revitalizing the gauge enables balloons, which then affect timelines and feed back into the pattern—but opposition is soft and outcomes are mostly favorable adjustments. Closure does land via a conceptual repricing: the world’s hope-logic has changed and the gauge’s final reading signifies a before/after. Cost, however, is more implied than dramatized, which blunts the impact at elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: diaries → map → hidden door → film → echo-development → revelation → vow, with no major orientation or logic slips. Closure lands as a decisive internal reorientation and conceptual repricing of the family legacy, and the cost (accepting complicity in catastrophe) is legible. The scene holds a steady drive with no unmotivated digressions. The main limitation is that the “confession/atonement” plan is gestured to rather than faced against a concrete obstacle, muting structural bite at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival on the terrace → ritual of borrowing heartbeats → painting mirages → citywide mirror transformation → her yearly disappearance. Causality is legible and closure lands with a clear before/after in the mirrors and in Elowen’s renewed heartbeat, with the bell toll marking the transition. The backstory of the beloved and the mirrors’ rigidity is concise and well-anchored in present action. Cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, but it’s on the page (children’s dreams as fuel; her ongoing bondage to the ritual).

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a primarily causal lens, the structure is clean: arrival → convening → ritual proposal → signatures → personal sacrifice → peace tremor. The closure is solidly on-page: her palm to the page and life’s blood sealing the rite produce a Decisive Change (the Forever War “stuttered to silence”) with a visible cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early via terrace/midsummer/Elara’s role, and the ritual mechanics remain consistent. The main structural weakness is how smoothly the delegates assent, with little sense of potential failure once the ceremony begins, slightly softening the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene walk to a ritual act, interwoven with backstory that directly informs the present stakes, and causality holds: his engineered drought creates the map that brings him, and the release precedes the storm break. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing image—the egg in the hollow as stormwaters seek the “map’s heart,” with his secret act reweighting his role from pure destroyer to ambiguous midwife. The dominant drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) remains stable, and the before/after—his burdened arrival versus lightened departure—is legible. The piece flirts with repetition in its middle (reiterating his corporate crimes and guilt), which slightly blunts structural tightness but does not damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is coherent: Elara’s decision to act during the ritual leads to untangling threads, unlocking the loom, entering the prism sanctuary, and seeding rebellion. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with a clear before/after: Empire in enforced serenity versus a fractured lullaby. Cost is more implied at the societal level than dramatized for Elara personally, so the decisive change feels slightly bloodless. Still, the structure is clean, the lens is primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and closure is unmistakably on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal line—argument → solitary reflection in the dome → re-reading the stick in reverse → decision to end the subversive shows—is clean and legible. The piece sustains a single reflective scene with anchored flashbacks and lands a genuine Decisive Change at the hatch. Cost is somewhat underplayed, but the before/after is clear and the dome walkout closes the arc. Structural repetition around “reverse” and “half-lit epiphanies” is coherent, if a bit on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb to grotto → iterative building of four signal towers → arrival of the last migration → dissolution and descent. Causality holds under a textural lens: each tower elaborates the central pattern and deepens the impending loss until the wind’s undoing becomes a natural, earned culmination. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara accepts the ephemerality of her signals yet carries “certainty” that such gestures inscribe memory, with the price of letting the work vanish. The stakes stay contemplative rather than plot-driven, but the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene building from preparation to ritual to activation, with a clear before/after once the rope is illuminated. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with each step in the method leading to the next. However, escalation is largely procedural and unopposed, so the climactic illumination feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and the cost is more implied than dramatized. Closure lands, but under relatively soft pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine—forest → bunker → directive → dream-pod → transcendence → exit—is clear, with the dream sequence functioning as the central structural hinge. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the accumulative/casual hybrid drive holds through closure. Closure lands via a decisive change and conceptual repricing: Elara gains full vision and reinterprets path-choice as entropy management, then acts (sealing the pod, leaving as guide). The main structural weakness is that the ethical dilemma (trapping walkers vs breaking loops) resolves quickly with minimal on-page struggle, so the turn feels more explained than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clear enough: discover tile → decode via schematics → reveal rift → seal covenant, with a legible before/after at the end. The piece reads as largely accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration when Ezar chooses the pact and resets the tile. However, the path is very smooth—no genuine setbacks or reversals—and the rebels’ approach never meaningfully enters the causal web. Cost at closure is implied rather than dramatized, which keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a single accumulating ritual: Elias uses the music box to push Thorne progressively deeper into memory until a decisive internal change occurs, and this causal chain is clear. The sanctuary’s rules and the music box’s function are consistent enough that reality stabilization at the end reads as a payoff for Thorne’s release. The drive lens feels predominantly accumulative/textural, and the closure (resentment as broken pin; exhale, stabilization, departure) is on-page with a felt cost. A small weakness is how foregone the outcome feels—Thorne never seriously threatens to derail the process—so tension of “will this work?” never fully spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from setup (mirrors, sextant, goal) through ritual to the dream-wife’s emergence, with clear causal links at each step. The drive lens reads as Causal with lyric texture—each move (placing mirrors, aligning sextant, synchronized breathing) logically advances the attempt to erase the boundary. Closure is a Decisive Change: the dream becomes embodied and the orchard is “whole,” with on-page transformation of circumstances. The main weakness is a somewhat frictionless success—no significant setback or risk complicates the path to that change, which softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the long-ago breach → wild orchard and failing visions → Elias’s ongoing tending → discovery of the bag → joint repair of the heart-tree’s eye → relational and world-level restoration. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration, as Lila reframes the vows and commits to future practice with her father. The coincidence of Lila arriving just after the bag’s discovery is somewhat convenient but not implausible in a mythic frame. Structure (single scene with integrated backstory) is tight and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: shuttle → orchard → bathroom epiphanies → sentinel/cameo → station/tome, with the central drive of unlocking the nonlinear inheritance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she accepts living “between the pages,” reconfiguring the inheritance from abstract threat to chosen mode of being. Yet escalation is soft and nearly frictionless—each new revelation arrives without serious resistance or setback, so the before/after feels more like a smooth continuum than a pressured turn with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is legible: time traveler arrives → Elara commits → two rescues yield tools → contract loophole is found → pact is renegotiated and the library opens. Closure exists (they gain access to the Library of Unlearned Lessons via a conceptual loophole) but the felt cost of success is minimal, with every obstacle dispatched cleanly. The quest pattern is clear but slightly outline-like, as key discoveries and the research leap are summarized rather than dramatized. The meta-textual intrusion near the end (“But wait, trim back—actual count must fit… [Adjusting flow.]”) undercuts immersion and weakens the climactic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a coherent causal arc: discovery of the swatch → use on narrative threads → emergence of the garden → crossing into a new state. Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Elara achieves her goal but at the price of being bound to the garden’s endless rediscovery. The accumulative structure of memories and altered recollections mostly supports this, though repetition of concepts slightly blurs beat differentiation. Causality never fully breaks, and the before/after line is legible with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: impossible time → impossible door → hidden chamber → artifacts + rope → recollected method → merge → anomaly resolved and tower restored. Structure is a single, legible scene with one main turn (choosing to reconfigure the rope and merge the seal), and closure is present in the fading door and harmonized clock. The main weakness is that the stakes of the “Pact of Echoes” and timeline preservation remain mostly conceptual, and the meta word-count coda undercuts the otherwise coherent cadence. Closure lands, but with a slightly deflated aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival of energy beings → harmonic disruption → crack readings → node discovery → conjuring the bloom of hush. The structure is essentially a single continuous ritual scene, which fits an accumulative/textural drive and leads to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (caves regaining a charged equilibrium). Cost is present conceptually (ongoing war with the beings, her continuing vigil) but under-dramatized on the page, so the closure feels slightly too easy. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from early on, with no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the shard enables clearer retrocognition, which reveals the star-path method, which leads to the rekindling under a specific convergence. Structure is linear and legible, with a strong inciting incident (unearthing the prism shard) and a well-staged climax atop the tower during the storm. Closure is decisive: the beacon’s ignition reconfigures Elara’s belief about coincidence and establishes a new world-state (a lit beacon for wanderers) with clear cost in time, effort, and psychic strain. The “coincidence of winds” clearing the clouds edges toward convenience but is thematically justified rather than structurally undermining.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story teaches an accumulative, lyric pattern—each monument’s shadow reading is a beat—and holds that structure cleanly through to a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is simple but intact: storm → fog-bridge → descent → readings → conclusion → return. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing about identity and memory, with the fog-bridge’s dissolution giving a soft temporal boundary. The main limitation is that the structural spine never quite tightens into a must-not-fail moment; the cost remains more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the fortress draws him, the knot-filter reveals the mosaic design, he builds the firework, launches it, and the resulting shift in the world and his purpose provides a solid Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The single-scene structure is clear and temporally continuous, with no orientation issues. Drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric texture supporting a straightforward causal throughline. The main structural limitation is the lack of any serious setback or complication; everything unfolds without a turn that threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from difficult conversation → charged pause → ritual/vision → reconfigured understanding, with no orientation or causality breaks. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds through layered imagery and the cicada ritual rather than overt events, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mira’s stance toward transition changes. The cost is subtle but present—her departure is reframed as molt rather than void, with implied pain carried forward rather than erased. Escalation is modest and entirely interior, which keeps this from the very top tier but the closure unit is solidly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece tracks a clean causal arc: anticipation of inversion → harvesting ordinary silences → discovery and cultivation of the gilded hush → intrusion of the noise-weaver → escape and decision to return home changed. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent, with the inversion and rare sprout providing a satisfying central tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts that she will return to the bunkers but armed with a changed inner resource, with a legible before/after. The only minor limit is that the external conflict with the noise-weaver resolves quickly, slightly undercutting peak structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: a single causal scene from arrival to departure with the vial as throughline and a clear before/after in the family’s state. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with causal beats (noise→vial reaction→catalyst) building toward a reconfigured silence. However, stakes and cost remain low; the “problem” of noise is resolved quickly and smoothly once the catalyst is introduced, so closure lands more as a gentle cadence than a hard-earned shift. The final image of “silence wiser” offers a mild Resonant Reconfiguration but without a strong sense of irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: flake → tunnels → waterfall → orchard → murals → trapdoor → stairway → throne, with the drones and sunrise clock providing external pressure. The drive lens is primarily causal, and closure lands via a decisive change—Elara claims the throne and reality shifts toward restoration. However, several key beats feel convenient or compressed (the murals instantly revealing all, the soul-testing stairs summarized rather than dramatized), which softens the sense of earned difficulty and cost. The ending is structurally satisfying but a bit frictionless for the scale of transformation implied.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal line is clean: isolation → intrusion via the ring → mounting psychic pressure → deliberate re-burning of the bridge. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with lyric accumulation, and the closure—an Earned Stasis where he reaffirms separation at cost—is clear on the page. The cost (her cry, his acceptance of continued solitude) is legible without needing explanation. Structure stays within one scene and never loses orientation, so the experimental texture doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is coherent: glitchy texts → retrieve and apply the bolt → pressure translates into diamonds → Elias commits to distributing them and broadcasting the method. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with a clean, if quiet, closure where his role crystallizes. Cost is conceptually noted (past losses, “loops eternal”) but under-dramatized in the climax, where everything works on the first try with no genuine risk or setback. The drive feels Hybrid (causal arc plus accumulative imagery), held consistently but without a sharp tightening at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: return to manor → gramophone/record → acoustic cipher → secret panel → letters → decision to erase the dynasty. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change and cost (destroying evidence and legacy), and the scene maintains temporal and spatial coherence. The standing-wave mechanism edges toward convenient contrivance, working perfectly on a first try without failed attempts or complication. Still, the structure fits the length and delivers a legible before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: knight enters → discovers program → deciphers patterns → pledges allegiance → unsnaps clasp → possibilities manifest → leaves changed. Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and the marionette program’s mechanics pay off in the climax. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: his allegiance binds him and grants the future-thread he sought, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the cost of this choice is only lightly implied, keeping the climax more conceptual than viscerally consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain—dust anomaly → hidden compartment → button and letter → emotional and vocational reframing—is clean and legible under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s stance toward her work and grief shifts in a tangible way by the end. Some backstory about Amos and Lila is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens what could be sharper turning points. Still, the structure fits the length and the closure feels genuinely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clear: failed rally → puddle-map → lagoon → phone booth → data-slates → broadcast, with a legible before/after in the regime’s information landscape. Closure lands: Elias discovers and activates original histories, shifting options for the wider world and affirming his role. However, several early set-ups (betrayal, dragnet, shattered cell) do not meaningfully complicate the on-page sequence—he evades drones and reaches the goal with little structural resistance. The piece reads as a clean causal progression, but escalation and on-page costs at key turns feel underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Elias arrives, the prophecy stirs, he escalates his musical counter-ritual, and attains a provisional silencing (“held—for now”) with a lingering tremor as Charged Poise. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—his pauses, whispers, and inversion of the code progressively erode the prophecy’s presence. The closure has cost and before/after legibility, even if the “world-ending” stakes stay mostly conceptual and distant. Some mid-section repetition of similar beats (murmurs vs. more hush) slightly flattens the sense of structural progression.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the leaf arrives, the speck is discovered and prodded, the sylph appears, more transformeds emerge, and the prophecy clarifies into a concrete directive. Structure is linear and legible, with closure in the arbor’s renewal and Lir’s new mission to descend and gather forgotten seeds. However, escalation feels more like accumulation of wonders than tightening of problem/solution, and cost at closure is conceptual rather than truly felt. Still, as a causal arc at this length, it functions smoothly and closes clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: broken watches → pattern at 3:17 → odd naval timepiece → compass → waterfall passage → greenhouse → ashes and chest → journals → mindset shift. Orientation is strong from early on; the subterranean workshop and later cavern progression are easy to track. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/decisive change, with Elias’s stance toward planning reweighted by the journals. The main limitation is that the external path remains relatively frictionless, so structure feels elegant more than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: coin discovery → weighing the name → realization of its destructive weight → risky kintsugi ritual → re-test → Thorne’s release. Structure is a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear before/after in both Thorne’s fate and Elara’s understanding. The closure (Thorne’s return and her redefined view of “balance”) lands on the page, but the solution arrives with minimal resistance or complication once she starts the ritual. The implied risk (“threatening to shatter anew”) never materially alters tactics, so the sense of hard-won cost is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tooth vibrates → Elara tracks Harlan → music draws him out → laughter-infused playing allows his release. The story maintains a single continuous scene with legible spatial progression through Echo Gorge and lands a clear Decisive Change when Harlan is absorbed and at rest. Elara’s residual ache and readiness for “the next confession” provide a modest but effective sense of cost and ongoing drive. Structure is straightforward and efficient even if somewhat predictable in its beats.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: waking in the forest, deliberately triggering trauma responses, and arriving at a crystallized understanding of mercy as an equation. Causality holds—each wave of bodily memory yields more information, culminating in the strap etchings and conceptual “release” in the forest. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (reframing ultraviolet penance into rooted harmony) with a visible cost in the self-inflicted retraumatization. The main limitation is that the decisive change is heavily abstracted; her options in the world beyond this realization remain only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure—present quest framed by childhood origin—coheres well, and the causal chain (discover lens → use it on paintings → unfasten clasp → release histories) is clear. Closure is on the page: the lens’s power is unbound and the overlooked histories become “eternal anchors,” a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. That said, pressure within the present scene is low; each step works more or less as expected with little real uncertainty or setback. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is legible and held consistently through to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is clean and early: we know who Theo is, where he is, and why he’s there, and the scene unfolds in a coherent causal chain (job → dust → ghosts → grate → barrel → key → bones → release). The drive lens is Causal, and closure lands with an on-page Decisive Change: the hidden body is exposed and the ghosts are released, with a clear before/after. The mainspring-contains-key coincidence is a bit neat but seeded enough not to feel like a cheat. The cost is modest but legible in the lightening of Theo’s ongoing “burden,” which keeps this strong but not elite.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: frost omen → broadside → descent → vial → rupture → collapse and repriced reality, with a clear before/after transformation. Closure lands both as Decisive Change (library destroyed, Elias fused with eternity) and Conceptual Repricing (rupture as necessary destabilizer of “perfect systems” in a negotiable reality). Structure is mostly linear with one reflective sweep at the end, which coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. A minor weakness is how frictionless the middle is—very few complications challenge the straight path to the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: the Unveiling → archaeological trove → dispute over shard → Elias’s scheme during a temporal storm → theft → destruction in the mirror, with each step motivated by his ideological goal. Orientation (who/where/what’s at stake) is strong from the first paragraph, and the storm plus mirror-lore are set up before being used tactically. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s destruction reconfigures the stakes from possession to proliferating, contested memory, with a clear before/after. The only structural limitation is that Lira and Kane’s late physical entrance doesn’t meaningfully alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged world → flawed music box under covenant → diagnostic moment with the un-wilting flower → tethering the stone chip → restoration of light and daughter. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in both cosmic and intimate stakes. The main structural limitation is that the repair proceeds almost without complication or setback, so tension within the scene is moderate rather than tightening hard. Nonetheless the story reads as a coherent single-scene arc with a solid causal spine and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain from factory shutdown to compass to cliffs to lagoon to guardians is clean and easy to follow, with one continuous throughline. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara returns changed, with new internal purpose and a charged relationship to mystery. However, the expedition’s prior doom never meaningfully complicates the path—each hinge pulls open without setback, so risk and consequence feel underdramatized. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with lyric overtones, but escalation is more a sequence of revelations than tightening choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: GPS fails → she’s stranded → discovers slide → receives timewoven guidance → sculpts lantern → escapes along a new path. Structure is linear and legible, with a coherent accumulative/lyric build toward the reconfigured archway and departure. Closure is present—a decisive change in both situation and worldview—with no major orientation issues. The main weakness is that the central problem (being lost in a storm) resolves quickly and almost entirely via benevolent magic, so pressure never tightens to a truly fraught turn.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: pavilion → postcards → cathedral window → layered restoration → epiphany, with snowmelt marking progression. Causality is coherent, and the “hidden layers of glass” motif ties neatly into her gradual understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—her stance toward the question (“why bloom at night?”) and toward her grandmother’s legacy is clearly reweighted with emotional cost. The main limitation is that obstacles remain soft; her repeated returns are obsessive but never seriously challenged, so escalation in pressure is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery of letters → unlocking the encrypted diary → retrocognitive plunge to lagoon → parley and revelation → return with charged knowledge. Causality is strong (each beat flows from the prior choice), and the closure—waking with transformed materials and a hardened resolve—reads as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing of the archive’s purpose. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid both in zeppelin and dune scenes despite the lyric density. Cost is mostly conceptual and implied (threat of eternal entrapment, moral weight of knowledge) rather than concretely tested, which keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal throughline is clean: last wish → empty cove → Elias uses bottle and working memory → town is reborn, with a clear before/after. Structurally this is a single accumulative scene that intensifies into a montage of creation and lands on an RR-style closure where the world is materially altered. However, escalation is mostly descriptive; there’s little sense his project might fail or veer, so the climax lacks real uncertainty. Still, the closure unit is legible and conceptually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the shaving → decision to immerse using childhood method → emotional outpouring → prophecy → internal reorientation at the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never lost, and the flashback is tightly motivated by the present action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from pure archivist to someone vowing to immerse himself, with clear conceptual and emotional cost. The stakes remain mostly internal and could be foregrounded slightly earlier for an even sharper before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the egg hatches, the vortex begins to fail, Elara uses the cap and seeds to reverse entropy and stabilize it, then claims the inheritance. Closure is solidly on-page with a decisive change (vortex stabilized, atrium thawing, inheritance secured) under a clear causal lens. However, the declared stakes (world-scale chaos, lineage time snapping back) never meet a concrete on-page failure point or complication; the ritual proceeds smoothly from intent to success. That lack of resistance or cost flattens structural tension and keeps the piece out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: sanctuary role → anomalous microclimate readings → solstice “zero hour” → snapped switch and repair → midnight choice → storm and village response → epilogue of consequences. Closure is a decisive change (choosing bell over siren) that reconfigures the system with visible long-term effects, so the before/after is legible. Structure is essentially one continuous scene plus a summarizing epilogue, which works but slightly dilutes immediacy at the end. No major orientation or causality breaks, just some smoothing in the “years on” passage.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: we move from setup (lonely janitor + relic), through the ritual with successive meteors, to a culminating star and interior shift. Causality within the chosen lens is sound—each wave of observation deepens his stance and leads naturally to the final repricing of vulnerability. Closure lands cleanly as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: he returns to sweeping but with a reconfigured understanding of strength. Some middle beats feel slightly repetitive in function, softening the sense of a single strong tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: ghosts appear → they guide him to the box → he deciphers the covenant → he helps retie it and assumes the role of guardian. Closure is solidly an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he embraces lifelong silent vigilance with the box as heart of the pact, and the before/after (blighted vs. cautiously reviving oasis) is legible. Some of the covenant explanation leans on expository summary (“The pact had promised…”), which slightly softens the sense of discovery and on-page cost, but the overall structure is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: garage-sale network → coded reply → descent → capsule opening → urn revelation → vision → new broadcast, with each step causally linked. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure: the urn’s transformation redefines time and Elias’s role. Closure is solid—he ends with a new function and cost (curating timeless loss for others), and the before/after is legible. Stakes remain fairly contained and the enforcer threat never materializes on the page, which keeps the pressure more conceptual than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: walk → discovery of feather → kite launch → string snap → repair → relaunch → reflection. The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual reweighting of loss into “beauty interrupted” and tended—is clearly on the page. Cost is modest but present: the kite is damaged, altered, and never restored to its prior ideal, and time/effort are visibly spent in repair. Structure is straightforward, without orientation issues or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: diagnosis → return/remodel → awakening → legacy, with clear causal links (diary → copper method → orchard activation → pilgrims). Drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural feel, and the closure (his death and the orchard’s ongoing hum) lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing unit with legible cost. Time jumps (“Days blurred into weeks,” “Months passed in his mind’s eye”) are handled smoothly enough not to break orientation. The only limitation is that most complications yield easily; very little on-page resistance tests his plan or forces new tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: approach → convergence with other seekers → tower activation → conceptual reveal and reweighting of first contact. Causality holds throughout (probe → obsession → hacked data → footprints → tower → holographic data) and the single-scene window is coherent. Closure arrives via conceptual repricing—first contact reframed as invitation and pilgrimage as engineered blueprint—but the cost of this realization remains largely intellectual, not dramatically felt. The global drive reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative imagery) and is stable to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: reef dies → battlefield exposed → submerged concord revealed → Thorne enacts the ritual and land begins to heal, yielding solid closure. The drive lens reads Hybrid but chiefly Causal at the end, with the ritual as decisive change and a mild resonant reconfiguration in his departure. Cost is present conceptually (the dirge of the reef, the weight of history), but Thorne himself pays little visible price beyond exertion and solemnity. Structure is tight and linear, with no orientation issues, but escalation is more procedural than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from cylinder discovery → riddle → journey → reunion is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. The structure holds as a single through-line with one temporal compression (the trek) that feels proportionate. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change in vocation and relationship stance, and the cost—accepting Mira’s hauntings and the falsity of the leaf’s “eternity”—is clear if quiet. The leap from solving the riddle to inferring Mira’s location is slightly convenient but not enough to break plausibility at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible: shutdown → isolation on the dilation deck → sketching per family custom → discovery of the rift via patterns and compass → decision to leave → emergence on alien soil. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change with a before/after (station vs new world), but the cost of leaving is lightly sketched and quickly overwritten by triumphant imagery. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with smooth escalation into the rift-jump, followed by a brief coda. No major orientation issues or rule-breaking occur, but the “Word count pulsed to finality” metafictional beat jars against the otherwise diegetic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: sky wrong → mission to fix error → infiltration → swap attempt → queen’s revolt → destruction → sky restored. Structure is a single continuous scene with a clear escalation and a decisive on-page change (the celestial reset) that resolves the dominant stake. The Arbiter’s role is thin but sufficient, and there are no major causality breaks or unkept setups. The cost at closure is conceptually present but a bit underplayed, keeping this just shy of elite rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: backstory seeds the crisis, then the ritual progresses through successive gesture-words toward “unbind,” leading to the penumbra’s transfer into the chessboard. Causality is coherent and the closure—a decisive metaphysical change with conceptual cost—is on the page and easy to track. The single-scene design suits the ritual frame, but escalation is fairly linear and frictionless, with no real uncertainty about success or alternative outcomes. Still, as an accumulative/lyric design, it lands a solid, legible before/after without structural missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece tracks cleanly from discovery of the stone through progressive seeding to a reconfigured understanding of home, with clear causal links (stone → feather method → revived visions → full awakening). The accumulative structure works: each glyph unlocked deepens both language and memory until the final glyph at the mountain’s heart reweights all prior beats. Closure is strong via conceptual repricing: “home was the labyrinth itself” is a legible before/after shift. The main limitation is that complications are more implied than dramatized; the path from problem to resolution feels relatively unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: he arrives, discovers the tapestry, decodes it, and undergoes an internal shift that causally unfreezes the village. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: each decoding step deepens both the maze-map and his self-reckoning, leading to the mirror and conceptual “promotion” that triggers time’s thaw. The closure has legible cost—his past exile and losses remain—but his relation to them reconfigures. The magic mechanics (how tapestry + labyrinth unfreeze time) are left lyric rather than systematized, though they don’t break the story’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure follows a clear accumulative arc: clandestine poetry sessions before a looming ritual, growing into a quasi-revolution. Causality is legible (her sessions → shifting beliefs → elders’ alarm), and the closure functions as a charged poise where the ritual’s success is now in doubt. The cost remains conceptual and projected—no direct retaliation or concrete consequence lands on the page—so the ending, while resonant, feels relatively safe. Still, the before/after is legible: a once-unified canyon is now irrevocably fractured in meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a causal sequence of matching pockmarks and narrating memories that powers the statue and saves the workshop—is coherent and holds the Hybrid (mostly causal) drive lens cleanly. Escalation across the five scars is clear, and the closure (workshop rising, inner certainty) lands on-page with a visible before/after. There is some rhythmic sameness to the middle beats (each pockmark gets similar treatment), and the “between breaths” frame stretches plausibility into a bit of frozen-time monologue, even allowing for fantasy. Still, the piece delivers a solid, legible arc with a meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mirror crack → trigger of buried vow → descent into caves → rediscovery of oasis → completion and activation of the shell → relinquishment. Structure is linear, with one clear escalatory turn (the holographic reveal of memories) and a quiet but legible closure in his decision to leave the shell behind and walk out lighter. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the final choice clearly reconfigures the initial nostalgic stasis. Stakes remain small-scale and interior but are coherent and carried through.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by vivid before/after (heat wave vs cool dawn) and a clear causal chain—find vial → choose whisper-magic → wait → Mira returns. Orientation is excellent from the opening lines, and the closure (her arrival and embrace) is decisively on the page. The global drive lens is primarily causal with some lyric texture, and that lens holds consistently. The main weakness is that the resolution comes very easily once he uses the vial, with little sense that the outcome could plausibly fail or exact a present-tense price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clean: stranded by hydraulic failure, he repurposes wreckage, takes guidance from calls, and culminates in lighting the censer and triggering visible returns. Orientation is solid from the outset and the lunar-cycle structure gives a legible progression through nights to the full-moon climax. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration—beacon lit, signal holding, villages rekindling, and his stance toward loss subtly altered—with a visible emotional and physical cost. The build goes relatively smoothly, with little real jeopardy to his project, which keeps the structural arc from feeling as pressured as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: empathy virus → social damage → Elias’s yearning for safety → discovery of relic → decision to occlude → altered social dynamic and ambiguous aftermath. The structure is essentially linear with one reflective swell around the textbooks, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he gains the ability to lie and uses it, but is left questioning the moral cost. All set-ups (relic lore, veritas nerve, psychological safety) pay off in the closing beats. Stakes and cost could be dramatized more acutely—there’s no concrete backfire yet—but the conceptual price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: encounter → acquisition of flower → influx of borrowed memories → investigation via “observing gaps” → reinterpretation and adoption of the gesture. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward his own solitude and vigil changes in a legible before/after way, with cost implied in his acceptance of a bond that won’t resolve his loneliness. Structure is linear with one reflective “shard” in the lighthouse that remains anchored to present stimuli and directly alters his eventual move. The only limit is that some explanatory lines about what the stranger “must” have meant verge on over-articulation, slightly flattening the mystery rather than letting causality and image alone carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: chip discovery → inference → journey → ants and glimmer → Doorway → visions → post-cavern integration, all under a coherent Causal lens. Closure is solid: the Doorway yields a decisive inner reconfiguration that resolves the lingering promise and reshapes his life in the final shard. The rising-creek danger is structurally sound as a clock, even if its payoff is understated, and there are no major plausibility or orientation breaks. The main limitation is that the key vision sequence is summarized quickly, so the pivot from quest to fulfillment feels a bit mechanically compressed rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: haunting dreams → ignored warnings → ascent → grotto revelation → magical test → empowered return. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear inciting incident (dreams and decision to climb) and a climactic choice (touching the pool and inhaling the starlight). Closure functions as a Decisive Change: Elowen accepts the bloodline curse as power, reconfiguring her reign’s future. The cost is present but more conceptual than felt—the story hints at a darker, thornier reign without fully pressing the immediate price of that transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a single continuous ritual scene with a clear before/after: Lirien arrives changed, performs an experimental alchemy, and successfully alters the nature of their bond. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward the whispered secret and the shell’s transformation as a Resonant Reconfiguration; closure is legible and not merely decorative. Causality is soft but coherent (her journey → preparation of tools → shared secret → successful capture of presence), though stakes and possible failure modes remain largely conceptual. The lack of concrete obstacles or reversals keeps it out of the top tier for a prestige market.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative lyric structure is coherent: grave-dream → induced jealousy → eruption into flight → realization that the grave marks rebirth → quiet return. Causality is clean under the chosen rules of this world (envy fuels lucidity, lucidity enables literalized flight). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the grave’s meaning is repriced, the method is “sated—for now,” and her stance toward her own deathwork subtly shifts. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual, but they are legible and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara opens the shop, investigates the faulty clock, discovers the screw, reconstructs Miriam’s birthing story, and returns the repaired clock with that new knowledge, which reconfigures how both women see the object. The Miriam sequence functions as a clear backstory shard anchored in the physical screw, so structure remains legible under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s sense that her work “matters” and the shop as “sanctuary”—but the meta-textual final lines about word count and system counts undercut the cadence and feel like an unearned, out-of-frame tag. That artifact slightly blurs the otherwise coherent ending beat and keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: platform arrival → pressure spike as scars crystallize → quill method discovered and applied → scars transformed as the storms resume, giving solid closure. Causality is legible and the “held breath between storms” frame provides a structural container that the ending pays off. However, the middle repeats a similar move across multiple scars without introducing new complications or a genuine risk of failure, softening escalation. The exile stake never manifests concretely in scene, keeping the external consequence abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: Elara enters the archive with a goal, finds the bottle, triggers the currents, summons Theo, apologizes, receives a partial forgiveness, and exits as the trees fall. Backstory is tightly anchored to present stimuli (the perfume bottle, the archive) and consistently reorients us back to the current scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: forgiveness is granted but cannot restore what was lost, and the orchard’s destruction underlines that irreversibility. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a strong textural overlay, and that lens holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative/textural arc: discover dictionary → enact spiral arbitration while walking the library → cosmic unification. Closure is clear as a Conceptual Repricing: the end of history is revealed as a false finality, replaced by eternal unity, and the library stabilizes as an “anchor.” However, escalation is mostly declared rather than dramatized; the “hiccup” as time limit and any real possibility of failure never quite bite. Still, causality within the mythic logic holds and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: anomalous readings and institutional dismissal → retreat and experiment with the key → temporal reversal/visions → reinterpretation of clocks and restored horizon. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: time shifts from duration to the “cut between illusion and the real,” and Elias’s function is redefined. The structure is cleanly contained in one arc, but the process of experimentation is almost frictionless—no serious setbacks or risks—and that slightly lowers the felt cost of the ending. Still, the pattern of actions and visions coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: Mira enters to test a device, meets Elias, receives a conceptual nudge, runs another test, and revises her approach; the causal chain is easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—security through calibrated permeability—tied to on-page actions with the beam and spores. The main weakness is that the stakes and costs of this shift remain mostly abstract and professional; nothing in the situation resists or complicates the change. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a thematic overlay, and it holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—library grief → subway riddles → abandoned station → secret archive → decision to publish—is clear and coherent, with the riddle mechanic consistently motivating movement. The piece follows a hybrid drive with strong accumulative texture (repeated paradoxical aphorisms) and satisfactory closure via conceptual repricing of her father’s legacy. The riddles and secret wing feel a bit convenient, with minimal obstacles or genuine uncertainty about success. Still, the final discovery and reframed purpose land as a real before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: we move from establishing his underground routine to the Mira arc, to escalating attachment, then to a deliberate break and a coda that reasserts the cycle. Causality is clear—repeated wrong-number calls deepen the bond, her dependency grows, he chooses to sever, which prompts her decisive change. Closure lands on-page with a legible before/after: Mira redirects her longing toward real life, and Elias resumes his pattern with altered proof of concept. The only limitation is that the middle escalation is summarized rather than dramatized in places, slightly flattening the sense of stepwise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/ritual frame: arrival → preparation → steeping → spectral return → renewed vow → parting. Orientation is solid early on (we know who she is, where she is, and what twilight does) and the ink-wars backstory slots efficiently into the drive. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant is renewed, he becomes guardian of the archive, and she departs with altered inner charge, with the cost of his continued absence felt but accepted. The main limitation is that obstacles are almost entirely implicit—nothing seriously threatens the success of the ritual on the page—so pressure rises more via lyric intensification than constrained options.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rumor → Elias’s arrival → rock’s circulation → dawn reconfiguration, with causality consistently legible. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias goes from elusive phantom to lingering participant, and the station’s reciprocity rule is subtly upgraded by the rock experiment. The piece stays in one temporal window (dusk to dawn) with backstory folded in via concise exposition and no orientation issues. The main structural limitation is low resistance—no serious challenge to the premise—so the central arc feels more like benevolent unfolding than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story has a clean quest structure: preparation with the ring, entry into the forest, intensifying journey, and arrival at the stillpoint, culminating in a clear emotional reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: following the ring’s dowsing and the musical trail “therefore” leads to the stillpoint and its revelations. Closure lands solidly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—his maps and his grief are reweighted by what the stillpoint reveals. The main limitation is that external complications are minimal, so the path from desire to attainment feels almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: wrong seeds → anomaly → discovery of pen → unbending → history edits → softened anomaly and internal reconfiguration, giving a legible before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a conceptual overlay, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where she accepts a revised world and a new role. However, the costs of revision are gestured at (“unforeseen alliances,” balance demanded) more than dramatized, so the ethical and emotional price stays somewhat abstract. Structure remains a single, coherent scene with no orientation debt, but the climactic edits resolve problems a bit too smoothly for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: harbor isolation → encounter with Elara → approach to festival → disruptive silent performance → reconfigured aftermath. Causality is legible and the closure—Finn no longer invisible, the festival’s noise reweighted into harmony—is a clear resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural rather than tightly causal, but escalation still coheres. Some beats, especially in the middle explanation of “mapping silence,” echo concept more than they advance options, slightly softening structural snap.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal breadcrumb trail is clean: figurine → murals → vandalized self-portrait → hidden stair → tapestry → vault → final sculpture. Structure is linear, legible, and focused, with no orientation issues and a clear dominant drive (fulfilling Theo’s promise by reaching the vault). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she claims the role of guardian and recommits to “portraying” the truth, with the vault’s survival as the concrete outcome. The cost is primarily emotional rather than situational, but it is on the page and tied to the journey’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara drums → the garden responds → memories surge → Kai manifests → they use the lagoon to escape, with the harness dissolving as a clear Decisive Change. Structure is linear and legible, with one continuous scene that tightens around the escape attempt. The main weakness is how smoothly the reversal of entanglement and physical escape occur once she escalates the drumming; external resistance (handlers’ alarms) arrives late and remains distant, blunting perceived cost. Closure is nonetheless solid: there is a clear before/after in constraint and freedom, framed by the universe’s inhale/exhale motif.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: wager → no-tech race in a storm-scrambled maze → Elias’s whisper tactics and map skills → arrival at the Heart → zodiac/key solution and victory. The drive lens reads as Causal with a light conceptual overlay, and closure is clear: Harlan loses maps and coin, Elias’s principle is proved on the ground. The geomagnetic storm and acoustic rule-set are introduced early and paid off in the race and the lock mechanism without major contradictions. The only limitation is that the “deeper motive” is gestured at but never structured into the conflict, making the outcome feel more like a clever contest won than a full reconfiguration of his life stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: Elara confronts Umbra, escalates via weaving and starlight, and lands in a resonant reconfiguration where Umbra becomes a different kind of darkness. Causality is accumulative but coherent—each escalation in the light-patterns yields deeper revelation and softening. Closure is clear and on-page, but the cost is primarily conceptual; Umbra’s shift carries little felt sacrifice or loss beyond a brief “shudder,” which keeps the ending from fully charged inevitability. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable and suits the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias’s gift → hidden grotto/rook → synchronized lodestones → town-wide chess displays → mental “forests of reflection.” Structure is linear and legible, with one main escalation into the night of the hush and a quiet but clear resonant reconfiguration at the end (the town’s mindset shifting). However, the plan encounters no serious obstacles and the Council remains an abstract pressure, so closure comes more as smooth fulfillment than contested achievement. The accumulative/lyric pattern holds, but the absence of a snag or complication keeps it below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: find scrimshaw → hearts unlocked → whale call → island appears → rope cut → transformation/arrival. Closure is solid as a decisive change: they irreversibly leave the docks and enter a new existence. Still, several major turns are conveniently aligned (magical object, whale call, island appearance) with minimal resistance or complication. The omniscient aside explaining the scrimshaw’s attribute feels slightly expository and undercuts the otherwise immersive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure—a continuous scene with one embedded backstory shard—reads cleanly, and causality from mandate → husband’s torment → mercy killing → present ritual is legible. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural: the repeated acts of narration and carving build to an earned, quiet closure in the talisman and her small shift toward “lightness.” That said, the story’s middle loops a bit on the same pattern (announce act, narrate act, gesture to bouquet) without a distinctly sharper turn. The final before/after is present but subtle enough that it doesn’t fully satisfy a top-tier closure bar.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: each paraphrased line visibly alters the colonnade and lake, leading to a clear before/after where boundaries become permeable and the poet emerges changed. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens—verse → quartz liquefaction → archway → crossing → thawing lake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive battle, but the cost of defying the old ban is more implied than concretely dramatized. Still, the piece reads as a single, continuous ritual with a satisfying structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: phoenix’s rules → Mira’s sleep → plant communication → reed retrieval → climb and bargain → awakening, with no major logical gaps. The drive lens reads as Causal with a clear dominant stake (Mira’s awakening) and a legible price (renounced sight). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Elias refuses “perfect” sight, reweighting the premise of bartered awakenings toward imperfection. A slightly smoother on-ramp from world-explanation to present-tense action would tighten structure further, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative pilgrimage structure is clean: Threshold Gong → laughter chamber → Whisper Bell → Heart Vault → Nexus Spire → Apex Chamber, each reweighting the central question. Causality is appropriate to a lyric, textural lens—each chamber’s discovery logically prompts the next refinement of her understanding. Closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing: connection’s “texture” redefined as gritty, fragile, and renewed rather than pure continuity. Stakes remain largely interior and contemplative, but the piece honors its own structural promises without confusion or dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: rock bottom → entry into observatory → discovery of stencil → development of origami method → progressive illumination → reconfigured mourning. Orientation is strong from the opening; the observatory frame and its rules stay coherent, and the drive reads as accumulative/textural with a clear RR closure. However, there is almost no setback or resistance—once the ritual is found, the path to success is smooth, which limits the sense of cost. The ending does land as a before/after reconfiguration, with her grief conceptually repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: Theo’s arrival with the letter, the decision to work together, and the ritual mapping that yields a new pattern form a coherent causal arc. The inferred lens is largely accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the past’s ruin reweighted into a potential communal future and a shared duty. However, stakes remain mostly intellectual, and the “cost” of their new knowledge—what they must forgo or risk—is implied rather than concretely dramatized. Within that limitation, the scene scaffolding, causal links, and final reconfiguration are solid and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line is clean for a lyric piece: discovery of the pagoda → failed, pattern-bound approaches → deliberate un-patterning → attunement → revelation → self-shattering purification. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural bias, and closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing (her understanding of nostalgia, and of “forbidden knowledge,” flips). Time, place, and stakes are anchored early and remain coherent; the collapsing archive and distant explosions provide a light situational clock. No major causality gaps or orientation issues, though some transitions are compressed in summary rather than fully scene-ified.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: noticing the erratic orbs → investigating via archival comparison → discovering the unbound shadow → choosing to bind it with the stone → metamorphosis and restored balance. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when/world rules), and closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost. The ritual and metamorphosis sequence feels somewhat frictionless; resistance and tactical complication are summarized rather than faced in scene, which softens the sense of earned difficulty. Still, the before/after is legible and meaningful, and the final state reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one reflective, present-tense scene anchored in the workshop, causally rooted in a betrayal that has just occurred. The chameleon’s regeneration and Elara’s stepwise “shedding” provide an accumulative spine that leads to a clear reconfiguration—she will rebuild, keep her gentleness, and seek justice. Stakes and situation never blur, and the final decision to alert authorities plus keep pursuing a sanctuary gives tangible closure. The main limitation is that pressure is internal and relatively static, with no strong external disruption or new complication intruding on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: surgery → new ability → plants’ guidance and coffee-ring omen → tunneling → discovery of the letters → reconfigured understanding of the accident. The piece delivers clear closure via a decisive change in knowledge and stance, with the box and letters paying off the earlier promise of hidden truth. Orientation is stable and the single-scene structure is easy to track despite the lyricism. The main limitation is how smoothly everything resolves once she decides to dig; there’s little sense that things might turn out otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: contact with the reel → visions of 1942 → deduction of the hidden panel → recovery of the box → conceptual reweighting of where love resides, capped by projecting the couple on film. Causality is legible and closure lands as a conceptual repricing (love stored in architecture and in her), with a before/after that feels coherent. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component carried by recurring motifs (thunder, lyrics, incubation). Stakes remain modest and the climactic discovery of Tom’s survival is somewhat rushed in summary, softening the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrive at the archway, learn the cosmic rule, perform the ritual across long time, then unlock creativity. Causality is coherent—auroras speak, she traces meteors, exhaustion leads to surrendering to rest, which triggers the release—and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: before blocked, after creatively eruptive, with time and stamina clearly spent. The cost is somewhat abstracted (no concrete consequences in the village or relationships), which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: find clock → access archive → cultivate sparks → relinquish clock for now and walk on altered. Causality holds within the piece’s rules, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where his role and the world’s prospects are reweighted. Stakes and sequence are legible despite the lyricism, though pressure remains low and much of the “work” happens in relatively frictionless montage. Still, the before/after of his purpose is clear and the final cadence feels properly closed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: awakening of the sixth sense → exploration guided by the hum → discovery of the gear’s socket → ascent to the corewheel → unraveling and rebirth. Causality is legible and the one major transition (sleep–translocation–return) is clearly signaled. Closure lands via a decisive internal and conceptual change as Elias fuses with the gear and reorients his life’s stance, though the cost is more implied than dramatized. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative textural build from the forest’s symphonies) and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: leash snaps → Elara takes the ridgeway → meets guides → ritualized journey → tidal pool revelation → return reconfigured as future guide. Causality holds without gaps, and the closure (claiming her courage and not returning to the village life) is legible with a before/after. The drive is a Hybrid of causal and accumulative; the loops/indirect routes build texture more than true complications, so escalation feels gentle rather than tightening. Still, the final overlook and pool offer a concrete, on-page closure beat with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is solid: arrival in refuge → routine of regeneration and silence → discovery of the bolt → revelation of Thorne’s past choice → Elias’s revaluation of his own silence and decision to stay. The backstory via “archived logs” is a bit convenient but it cleanly explains Thorne’s guilt and doesn’t break causality. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Elias chooses to remain, but with a transformed understanding of what his silence and safety mean. The cost—accepting complicity and a life within the fortress—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: pretender arises → Lirion, constrained by the temporal snare, crafts drift-rune messages → these books reach key players → pressure accumulates → the final book lands in the pretender’s hands and detonates his claim. The drive lens is primarily causal with an accumulative texture, and closure is decisive: the coronation collapses and the empire reconfigures around unveiled truth. However, almost all of the middle and even the climax are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts felt cost and makes the collapse read as an elegant montage rather than a pressured scene. Still, there is a clear before/after with conceptual cost (an empire undone, a cosmic balance restored), satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear: past witnessing → present obsession → assembling disparate data → holographic reconstruction → conceptual breakthrough → broadcast. The structure is essentially one continuous pressured investigation with a tightening middle (projector build, storm swell) leading to a delayed revelation and then a decisive outward act. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: paths are refigured as metamorphosis rather than simple loss, and that knowledge alters his stance. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and thematic rather than acutely dramatized, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: she enters the bay → finds the glasses → spots the convergence → discovers the stone circle → activates it and broadcasts the hum. Structure is linear, focused, and closure is clear: the lull ends and the rebellion stirs, with her vision now guiding. The main weakness is the absence of serious resistance or complication; once the circle appears, everything works on the first try, so the decisive change lands but with limited struggle or cost. The inferred drive lens (primarily causal with some accumulative-lyric texture) holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation and causality are clean: plant-whisper → kite → script → embryo → ritual → sapling, all in a coherent causal chain. Closure lands through the unsealing and the Caldera-wide awakening, a clear before/after shift. The cost of this decision, though stated (risk to tradition, ecosystem, councils), never materially complicates the path to the climax—there is no real resistance or setback on the page. Structurally sound but lacking a sharper crucible to earn its large-scale implications.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and causal: discovery of the photograph → sensory trigger from the lighthouse wind → traumatic freeze and reframing → outreach to the grieving artist, culminating in shared stillness. The global drive is primarily Situational/Accumulative: pressure builds through sensory echoes and internal realization rather than external plot. Closure is an Earned Stasis/RR where she redefines her freeze response and chooses connection, with the photograph as a reweighted object. No major causality breaks or orientation issues, though the latter dialogue beat verges on thematic coda.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: lighthouse library → discovery of the tarot → untangling → descent → loom → emergence, with clear because/therefore links. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the accumulative drive toward the loom of fate is coherent. Closure lands as a decisive change/charged poise: Elias emerges with restored artistic integrity and a reconfigured stance toward shadow and light. The main limitation is that the external plot remains almost entirely frictionless, so structural turns feel smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: aftermath of eclipse → drone and ink cipher → Mira’s disappearance → Elowen’s choice to follow → explanation in the ink-void → return with new understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his ability and a small decisive change (commitment to wield it). The structure is linear and legible, with one clear escalation when he destroys the drone and reactivates the patterns. The main weakness is that the “answer” appears with little resistance or complication once he enters the void, so the resolution feels somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is solid: glitch → perceived sign → decision to transmit → network awakening → implied Regime response, all in one continuous scene. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what the pods are) and closure lands with a decisive change: she has irrevocably crossed from keeper to saboteur, with cost implied in “alarms would blare topside soon.” Escalation is somewhat smooth and foregone, as no opposing force actively tests her resolve on the page, but the structure remains coherent and purposeful. The ending image of charged stasis—routine motions with new secret stakes—closes the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: tower falls → breach → looters arrive → Elara deploys cultivated roses → Jax returns to see the result. Closure is solid as an Earned Stasis/stance crystallization around nonviolence and continuity, with the dagger-sheathing as decisive change. Stakes and cost are modest—the defense succeeds quickly and bloodlessly, so the outcome never feels in doubt. Structure is otherwise clean, single scene with a small late coda.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: rare cosmic disruption → echo appears → others fail by noise → Elias uses voiced silence and the rail spike to catch it → he ends with both prize and renewed drive. Structure is linear and coherent, with one main escalation around the moment “patterns break themselves” and the constellations shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has achieved the initial goal but reframed it as only the first verse in a larger, costlier calling. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—an endless, consuming quest—so it registers more as mythic charge than sharp on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain from journalist’s accusation → observatory confrontation → logical unmasking → decision to “print redemption” is clean, with clear before/after stakes. The story maintains single-POV continuity in one contiguous window and lands a real closure beat where her understanding of her father and her future path reconfigures. However, the ledger/chronology contradiction is explained more than dramatized, and the reversal/confession arrives quickly once she speaks, softening structural tension. The cost of this new knowledge—what it will demand of her publicly—is more asserted than on-page tested.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is coherent and satisfying: letters → amber → haunted firmware → tattoo tether → resolution of the haunting guilt. Time-folding is legible and pays off by letting present Elias confront and amend his past action rather than feeling like a gimmick. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: he binds her to himself and reorients his future practice. The one limitation is that every step works on the first try, with little sense that the plan might fail or misfire, which slightly softens the structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: we move from ritual setup → mounting vocal chaos → Elara’s discovery/use of the tile → emergent hush and reconfiguration of the group. Causality is intelligible and mostly sound, with the acoustics and tile leading to the hush in a way that fits the established rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the unlearning shifts from fracture toward fragile unity, with the ephemerality of the mandala and hush providing a quiet cost. The main limitation is that the key turn (arguments threatening to shatter the ritual) is summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat, which softens the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s curse → contact with tessera → clearer visions → discovered method → renaming Kael → plaza’s emotional and cosmic shift. Structure is tight for the length, with one continuous scene and a clear closure beat where both Kael and the plaza reconfigure. The main weakness is how frictionless the climax feels; there’s no serious risk that the renaming will fail or that Kael will resist, so escalation reads more as a smooth ritual than as pressured decision-making. Closure still lands, with a legible before/after, but at a lower dramatic temperature than the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: Elena’s nocturnal return → discovery of the coin → encounter with Reginald → echo performance → renewed resolve. Causality is coherent—touching the coin triggers the ghost and echoes, which in turn catalyze her decision to sing and then to reengage with her career. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change: she books a new gig, reinterpreting the theater’s closure as intermission, though the emotional “price” of that decision is kept soft. The accumulative/textural build of echoes and nostalgia toward that shift holds together without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: static shock → decision to test → escalating somatic experiments → blind test → years-later coda. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative/textural lens; each exposure deepens the central question and leads logically to the blind test as a climax. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reinterprets their bond as “real” without pills. The cost of that shift (what she was willing to risk losing) is present but somewhat underplayed, keeping this short of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: discover fossil → map its emotions → emotional overload/floating → public revelation → legacy. Structure leans accumulative/lyric, but there is still a discernible escalation toward the floating sequence and then a cooling coda. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—Lira becomes the living bridge and eventually relinquishes the fossil—yet the cost of that shift is conceptual more than felt. The long-time-jump summary (“Years blurred; Lira aged…”) softens structural impact by moving key consequences offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the jar → recognition of a doom-prophecy → decision to decode via buttons → revelation of choice → inversion of the hourglass and ascent with the liberated echo. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of prophecy and fate, and the before/after is legible. The main weakness is the low friction—nothing meaningfully resists his project, and failure never feels likely. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not gripping at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: decoding snow codes → discovering the rook’s nest → meeting Lena → activating her file and handing off the pillbox → Elias’s quiet recommitment to life outside the network. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses not to rejoin or die, instead accepting a liminal role with real cost. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, but the external stakes (Vilnius relay, danger of discovery) remain abstract, leaving pressure somewhat low. The cyanide and "burned" status are set up as heavy constraints but never quite sharpen into a real on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: rain, gutters, fog, and stitches build toward a single realization about the true core of the promise. Causality is soft but legible—working on the palimpsest under these conditions leads him to reinterpret the vow and accept a distilled duty. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the promise is reframed from grand, tangled obligations to a simple, enduring fidelity to the crossing. The main limitation is the low felt cost; nothing significant in his external situation or inner options is convincingly foreclosed by this realization.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece works well as an accumulative, lyric structure: arrival → investigation via lantern → following sun patterns → pot-making under thrumming → articulated realization. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: resistance as “quiet turning toward kindness,” mapped onto Kai’s own nature. Causality is soft but coherent; each step logically deepens the inquiry without temporal or spatial confusion. The cost at closure remains mostly conceptual, so the arc, while clean, lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: rosebush loss → descent to harbor → encounter → shared row → gift of the gauge tooth → return to the garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with Mira leaving changed and Elara pruning in acceptance, and the stakes (will connection take root?) are legible. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural with enough causal glue to hold. The main limitation is that escalation is gentle and the cost of the final choices, while present, remains relatively low-intensity for the level of lyric weight implied.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clear: approach stone circle → attune to hum → manifest Aelari echoes → claim new role. Causality broadly holds, but outcomes arrive with little complication—each ritual step simply works, and no attempt fails or backfires. Closure is present as a decisive change and reconfiguration (from lonely guardian to empowered coexistent), yet the cost is faint and largely implied rather than dramatized. The drive reads as mostly accumulative/textural with light causal scaffolding, and that lens is held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: isolation → visit to temple/art → offering the twig spiral → public magical response → Theo’s appearance and reveal that her letters led him back. The piece uses a mainly causal drive with a light magical/accumulative overlay, and closure lands in a decisive reunion plus her vow to stop ghostwriting in shadows. Cost is present (relinquishing anonymity, confronting seven years of regret) but could be sharpened by a harder on-page dilemma or friction once Theo appears. Despite the high coincidence/enchanted convenience, the story’s rules accommodate it without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong: discovery of the manipulative signal → plan to counter → human interference (Harlan) → successful broadcast → partial reset with an acknowledged lingering threat. Orientation is clean early on, and the single-scene structure keeps the drive lens firmly causal. Closure lands as a decisive change (signals scrambled, town de-escalated) paired with an earned awareness that the reprieve is temporary, which gives the ending weight. The main structural limitation is how quickly the on-page opposition collapses once the counter-signal is deployed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: Elias descends for the key, discovers the compass, triggers spatial mutiny via the organ, then learns and uses the compass’s function to quell the mutiny and access the key. The structure is linear and coherent, with a distinct inciting incident (organ chord), escalation (spatial mutiny), and climax (thrusting the compass into the seam). His insight into the compass’s precise purpose arrives a bit conveniently, feeling more like authorial fiat than deduction grounded in prior specifics. Closure is otherwise strong: he secures the key, the nexus stabilizes, and the world’s fallow period begins to end, with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is cleanly causal: quarry search → ribbon discovery → blood ritual → vision of events → portrait → identification → recovery and confession. Closure is decisive and legible, but the central supernatural leap (a single blood-smear on a ribbon instantly yielding a full, accurate reconstruction of the murder and evidence theft) feels convenient and under-contested. The resolution of the investigation is mostly summarized off-page, reducing on-scene pressure and the sense of earned cost. Still, the before/after (emotionally and investigatively) is unmistakable and anchored in the on-page act at the quarry.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: jet stream shift → marooned station → salvage of journals → decoding stanzas → nail and logs → confrontation with Hale → transmission and reversal of exile. The structure compresses several big moves into summary (the decoding, the guild’s reaction), but the throughline remains legible and motivated. Closure is solidly on-page: the exile is decisively reversed while the larger catastrophe persists, giving a clear before/after with conceptual cost. A bit more friction or contingency in the confrontation and transmission sequences could deepen the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—hitchhiker vanishes → flake is found → scaffold wrap reveals a map → song crystallizes a vow—is coherent and easy to follow. As an accumulative, nearly single-scene piece, it lands a clear closure beat in the decision to follow the secret trail tomorrow, reconfiguring his “never” stance. The cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual; the story never pressures the decision with competing options or concrete risk. Structurally, it’s tidy and legible but feels somewhat low-stakes for the amount of symbolic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is coherent: Elias claims the train, builds the startup, faces Raoul’s pressure twice, then ends in an altered stance after the rise and fall. The startup’s ascent and market-driven collapse are mostly summarized, so the central conflict resolution leans heavily on the Raoul confrontations rather than a fully dramatized business arc. Closure qualifies as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts guarding his “circle” rather than chasing robber-like extraction, with the cost of failure and isolation legible. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Lyra’s struggle → telegram plea → Thorne’s lucid-dream experiment → insight → temple confirmation. Closure is present—the inscriptions are decoded and the shared burden lightens—but the arc is frictionless, with no credible risk that the attempt might fail or mislead them. The piece reads as a single, coherent window with one temporal progression (midnight to dawn) under a mostly causal lens. The cost of success is barely felt, which softens the impact of the otherwise neat structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: failed mirror spell → vortex → discovery of the frozen confession → need to “unbend” the spirals via the seed → blood price → confession released → escape. Structure is cleanly single-scene with integrated backstory that directly affects present tactics. Closure is decisive and on-page: he alters his situation and self-understanding at a visible cost. Slight predictability and lack of a sharp structural surprise keep it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: quantum rifts → eclipsed covenant → Elara’s ritual with the clipping → journey to nexus → restoration. Structure is linear and legible, with a clear before/after in the world’s state and Elara’s relationship to the covenant. However, once she initiates “linking through scars,” the path to success feels unimpeded; the nexus sequence lacks meaningful obstacles or reversals that could jeopardize the outcome. Closure functions (covenant restored, earned stasis in her root-bound condition), but the price of success is modest and not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: she enters the orchard to barter destinies, finds the card, performs the ritual, pays blood, and feels an immediate metaphysical consequence. The single continuous scene suits the length, and orientation (who/where/what she wants) lands quickly and cleanly. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change in her fate and a Charged Poise around “prices yet unpaid”—but the nature and scale of that cost are left somewhat vague. The drive reads as primarily Causal with some lyric accumulation, and that blend holds coherently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: humiliation → exile in quarry → encounter with scrap → appraisal-as-coping → decision to pursue a memorial and leave the trailer. Causality is coherent under a situational lens; the found object and his recent failure combine to force a stance on who he is now. Closure lands with a decisive change (he stops hiding, commits to using his skills for Jax’s memory), and the cost—risking further public exposure and reopening grief—is legible if not deeply dramatized. Some beats reiterate his backstory rather than tightening the present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: spirit’s absence → arbor destabilizing → seed planted and inscribed analogies → sprout stabilizing fields → pilgrims’ visit and shared decoding → quiet closure. Causality is legible within the lyric mode, and the final earned-stasis beat (ambitions transformed into legacy) lands clearly. The cost—loneliness, relinquishing the haunting—is present but underplayed, and the threat of the arbor’s collapse never quite tightens into felt jeopardy. Still, the before/after of his stance and the arbor’s state is clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s turmoil → refusal to migrate → capture in the creel → smelting → reintegration, with a clear before/after in her relationship to routine and wonder. The accumulative lyric frame around the atrium and librarian supports a coherent situational/causal hybrid lens. Closure lands on Elara’s internal change plus the continued cycle, but the cost of failure (shattering, being stuck) is asserted more than viscerally felt. Structure is linear and solid, if somewhat low in surprise or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: inspection → hesitation at the override → discovery of shell → reading of confessions → activation of pearl → decision to crown the node → bunker’s transformation. Orientation is strong from the outset (who he is, where he is, what the assignment is) and the scene maintains a single, legible throughline. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: Elias renounces the old binary of approve/condemn in favor of re-purposing the bunker into a nexus, aligning with his reconfigured understanding of his role. The only limit is that external consequences and risks of this act remain abstract, keeping the stakes more conceptual than materially pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: stopping meds → pilgrimage to station → discovery of graffiti maps → reinterpretation of guilt → departure with lighter burden. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with a clear tightening around the bathroom discovery and a resonant return to the waiting room/accordion at closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the same life and history, but newly mapped as shared with the river and prior seekers, with some felt cost in accepting that “one life paid the price.” The main limitation is that external stakes and concrete consequences are muted, so the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → library → watch → cipher → inner library → documentation → exit, with a legible before/after anchored by her altered state and fulfilled quest. The drive lens reads primarily causal with some accumulative texture from the atmospheric build. Closure lands (she attains the library and pays a conceptual/emotional price by taking those unspoken words into herself), but the “failure” side of the promise and the looming second letter stay abstract. The puzzle resolves relatively smoothly, so structure works but doesn’t squeeze options as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causality is clean: solstice deadline → coffee divination → ivy’s telepathy → provenance confirmation → violin performance that reconfigures her options. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal plus accumulative lyric motifs), and closure lands via a decisive on-page choice with a legible before/after (isolated artist vs empire-leading composer). The cost—accepting empire while reshaping it—is present but somewhat soft, with little external resistance or concrete negative consequence in the final beats. Structure is otherwise tight for a single-scene piece and honors the deadline frame without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal line is clean: elder at the brink → extraction attempt → success → mounting static → self-infusion → renewed ward, giving a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with on-page cost (pain, permanent binding of her essence to the chip). The structure is a single, coherent ritual scene with one escalation point (when static surges and she turns the process inward). The ease and totality of her renewal slightly soften the sense of long-term price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: climb → hairpin → visions → recognition of past life → ritual scalloping → grove’s renewal and inner contentment. Closure is a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: she reinterprets her role and her kin’s betrayal as part of a necessary cycle. Structural weakness lies in the heavy backstory block (the kin’s attack and exile) being offstage, so the “unforgivable” stakes don’t peak in real time here. Still, the ending’s before/after—drifting caretaker vs. purpose-ignited caretaker—is legible with conceptual cost (endless duty, acceptance of cyclical pain).

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: campfire → ascent → consultation → ritual → changed descent, with a legible before/after and a clear causal chain. The core turn—choosing the “cloak of doubt” over vengeance—is dramatized through the chimes and mirror shard, and the later walk toward reconciliation closes the initial drive. However, escalation is smooth rather than sharply segmented, and the lighthouse ritual never feels at risk of failing or backfiring, which softens closure cost. The piece holds a coherent hybrid causal/lyric lens, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is straightforward (arrival → trance → visionary lesson → post-trance understanding), with clean orientation and a coherent build under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: youth requires vanishing, and Elara exits the scene with altered understanding and a charged decision to wait. However, escalation is mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of options narrowing or stakes concretely testing her—she does not yet choose the grotto or refuse it under visible cost. Meta-asides about drafting (“Wait, overshot; trim”) slightly fracture immersion and weaken the ending’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative lens: Thren discovers the arrowhead, chooses a particular appraisal method, persists through escalating attempts, and finally unlocks its truth and pays a cost. The long temporal sweep (days → months → decades → centuries) is handled via purposeful summary that deepens the central pattern instead of diffusing it. Closure is strong: the wandering pulse joins him and his body becomes an anchor while his mind roams, a decisive before/after with visible cost. The only limit is that opposition remains abstract—no new structural complication beyond endurance itself.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: failed Artificer upkeep → Thorne sent as “maintenance” → discovery of the keystone → decision to unstrap → mist walk → claim the stone, with no orientation issues. Closure lands via a Decisive Change—he removes his restraints and leaves with the keystone, with the world below implicitly altered in its options. However, the path is almost frictionless once he commits; the vortex and potential dangers never significantly complicate tactics or threaten failure, so cost at the climax is more implied than felt. The structure is solidly publishable but lacks a truly sharp turn or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: festival → exposed wreck → library → book → reunion, with no major orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when he uses the key and Lira reforms, and the luminous-vows premise is repriced. However, the path is almost frictionless—no meaningful obstacle from the sea, wreck, or librarian—and the resolution feels more discovered than earned. The cost of success is underdeveloped, making the arc satisfying but not yet elite.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: setup of the contracted cosmos and her role, then a sequence of divinatory “bursts” leading to the revelation of the backwards prophecy and the decision to broadcast. Causal links are generally solid under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—each casting selects the next interpretive move, which gradually clarifies her purpose. Closure lands: she acts on the prophecy and the universe “stirs,” giving a decisive before/after, though the price of failure is gestured at via others’ obliteration rather than borne by her in-scene. The pressure curve is more procedural than suspenseful, but it does cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure: find chest → play recordings → monsters emerge → naming/crystallization → reconfigured stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent, with each recording and name tightening the pattern and leading naturally to the next monster. Closure is solid as an on-page resonant reconfiguration—Elowen’s relationship to sacrifice and fear is visibly altered, with a clear before/after. There is minor repetition in the middle (each monster beat similar in shape), but it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: last fish caught → cosmic imbalance → damaged bell as solution → iterative attempt to repair via drip-synced magic → restoration and world-stabilization. The scene stays in one place with a single throughline, and the escalation from initial measurement to failed repair to deeper pattern-divining is legible. Closure is decisive and on-page: the bell tolls, stars steady, and Elowen’s stance reconfigures. The only limitation is that some world-rule stakes (Leviathan shoals, cosmic tides) remain more told than tested in-scene, slightly muting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and legible: drought → reservoir recedes → photographs appear → buried memory resurfaces → confrontation with a descendant → ritual expunging and a new narrative shared. The drive lens reads as predominantly Causal with some accumulative texture, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elias emerges with a reweighted relationship to his guilt and his role. The main structural slip is that the key failing (overlooked crack, ignored plea) is summarized rather than partially dramatized, softening the punch of the core revelation. Still, the ending cost and before/after line are on the page and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear before (unbalanced, preparatory) and after (newly harmonized) anchored in a single setting. Causality is solid in an accumulative/lyric way—the crystal, flame, orchard, and starlings sequence toward a single climactic infusion and inner shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits the grove with a reweighted self, the transformation at dusk now charged differently. However, the failure mode of the rite is gestured at (“lest the alchemy consume her unbalanced soul”) without any concrete near-miss or complication, softening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: anomaly spotted → buckle revision → vector correction → Lena’s safe landing → reflective closure. The piece lands a credible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending: he endures the burden with renewed but costly purpose. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a late reflective taper that still anchors in present action (re-fastening the buckle, scanning anew). The main limitation is that the apparent peril is resolved without any significant loss or irreversible trade-off beyond stress, so the closure’s cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kai confronts Elara, uses the Blade to strip illusions, seizes the jar, performs the rite, and the fusion changes his state and the custody outcome. The single-scene structure is coherent despite the cosmic backdrop, and the closure (duplicate vivified as “complement,” numbness ended) reads as a decisive change with cost (blood, risk of “unstable revival”). Some steps—like the ancient lore of complementary opposites—arrive a bit as explained rule rather than dramatized constraint, but they don’t break causality. The temporal chaos outside remains more atmospheric than structurally determinative, yet it does not confuse orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is legible: mysterious seed → orthogonal analyses → discovery of legal protections and plans → vow to safeguard the space. The structural “orthogonal approach” framing gives a clear progression of investigative beats. However, several payoffs feel conveniently engineered—the invisible ink, the exact coordinates, the flash drive in the brook—reducing the sense of hard-earned resolution. Closure is present (his space is secured conceptually), but the resistance feels abstract and mostly off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: hourglass empties → Elias assembles and ignites his orchestra → intensification of the sonic ritual → laughter restored just as time runs out → return to hush. Causality is legible within the lyric frame, and the echo tunnel’s rules are consistent enough that the maceration of griefs and resulting laughter feel like an on-page consequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: silence is redefined from deprivation to a balm, with the cost of Elias’s ongoing isolation. There are no major orientation or lens slips, though the conflict is more ritual progression than contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: exile → disciplined waiting/interiorizing → cultist apparition → portal → return, with a clear before/after and on-page decisive change. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the methodical interiorizing and stance toward uncertainty enable the pendant to flare and the boundary to open. Closure lands solidly with a return home that is contingent on the protagonist’s changed relationship to uncertainty and to the environment. The main limitation is that most turns feel anticipated rather than surprising; escalation is smooth but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong: each experiment fails for a concrete reason, prompting a more extreme next step and culminating in the decisive destruction of the crozier. The structure—first/second/third approximation → insight → final act—is clean, legible, and escalatory. Closure is solid: his destiny meaningfully changes on the page, with a clear before/after anchored in the tree’s emergence. The only limitation is that destiny-rewriting feels slightly easy, with minimal friction beyond repeated failure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: lunar perigee overloads the system, forcing Elara to apply her tools and method, which reveals the city’s purpose and enables rebirth. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the piece maintains a single coherent scene with one clear drive. Closure lands as a decisive change: the city shifts from precarious abandonment to functional broadcast hub, with her interpretation as the hinge. The main weakness is that the revelation about the gorge’s design and the city’s intended rebirth feels somewhat convenient and low-cost rather than hard-won or contested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: weird time → spectral grotto → vanishing ferry → discovering the hourglass → decoding patterns → radio solution → restored timelines. Closure is on-page and coherent, with the ferry saved and Elias altered by keeping the hourglass and memory of sideways time. However, the problem-solving is quite linear and largely unopposed; the hourglass’s function is decoded with minimal friction or risk of failure. The felt cost at closure is conceptual rather than materially or emotionally sharp, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: he enters the gallery with a drive, engages the loom, builds a tapestry, triggers an eruption, and exits reconfigured. Cause-and-effect under the chosen lens mostly tracks (more weaving → more destabilized memories → tapestry eruption → conceptual repricing of connection). Closure lands cleanly: he has moved from architecting illusions about connection to carrying a new internalized weave, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the eruption feels somewhat inevitable rather than precipitated by a distinct on-page decision or threshold, softening the sense of a decisive structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Kai arrives with a goal, Elara uses the chain and edge geometry to teach him, and he departs newly equipped and resolved. The structure is essentially a single instructional scene with a mild closing reweighting; the rift simulation serves as a visual peak but not a real turning point. Closure qualifies as a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—Kai leaves ready to act, and Elara’s unease reframes the achievement—but the felt cost is faint. Stakes and options do not narrow meaningfully beyond “learn vs remain ignorant.”

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong: finding the photo and aid → hearing Evelyn → recognizing Clara → intervening → Clara’s averted suicide → coda with renewed purpose. Backstory (Evelyn’s death) is efficiently folded into the present and clarifies the current stakes without derailing momentum. Closure is solid: Clara’s decision to live and Elara’s sharpened mission mark a clear before/after with emotional cost. The extended, summary-style denouement slightly diffuses the peak’s immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: cave → breached airlock → codex → phase transition → cable nexus → return with closure, all under a tide clock. The drive lens reads as primarily causal, with each step motivated by her need to locate and honor the lost team and by the codex’s revealed functions. Closure is on-page via a resonant reconfiguration: she has returned, borne witness, and sealed the cave, accepting a new stasis with cost. The main structural weakness is that the phase-transition mechanic appears and scales up quickly at mid-story, feeling a bit like a late-power spike rather than something more gradually integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: arrive at observatory → contact with ghost → defragmentation attempt → thematic revelation and departure, all under a clear causal lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her identity is reweighted by the experience and the last beats underline a before/after in how she holds her survival. Causality is clean and there are no orientation issues; the heartbeat-count motif also provides an implicit temporal spine. The main limitation is that the path to success is smooth—everything works once she starts, so the decisive change is more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (“across the death of that language… Years blurred…”) is coherent and legible, with the diamond discovery and tunnel ritual forming a clear arc toward a resonant closure. Causality is clean: loss of speakers → quest for a method → cursed diamond → tunnel of echoes → bird-pattern harnessing → gem as vault. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Thorne completes his purpose at the price of his own dimming, and the language survives as felt sound rather than speech. The main weakness is that most resistance (curse, risk of madness) stays conceptual rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s tending of the garden → discovery of the arrowhead → deeper exploration → cordless phone confessions → brother’s message → her spoken confession → metamorphosis. Closure is a legible Decisive Change with emotional and conceptual cost (relinquishing bitterness, shedding her “undercover” posture). However, the resolution mechanics (arrowhead + phone = instant transformation) compress the central problem rather than escalating it; once the device appears, there are no meaningful obstacles or failed attempts. Structure is coherent and oriented, but the ease of the final turn keeps it below an elite, fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: she plays → signal spreads → trees stir → statues converge → she uproots the iron roots → orchard is freed. Orientation is solid early on (who/where/what’s wrong) and the piece maintains a single, continuous scene with no confusing jumps. Closure is decisively on the page with a clear before/after for the orchard. The main weakness is how quickly and smoothly the climax resolves; the statues’ threat never quite materializes as a structural obstacle, so the final change costs less than the setup implies.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: Elias arrives at the arcade, performs his public duty, secretly deploys drones to enact his true mission, then receives a letter that reconfigures his own trajectory. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyric texture), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when his abstract goal (“Healing Expanse”) gains concrete coordinates and reciprocal contact. Setup pays off neatly—the absences-as-map logic echoes in the border network finally “linking” him to his lost partner. The main limitation is that external complications (guard check, siren) never quite bite hard enough to meaningfully threaten the throughline, so the structural turn is more emotional than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine (wrong turn → hidden oasis → halo fragment → restoration → renewed artistic drive) is clean, with a legible before/after: Elias emerges changed in how he engages silence. The accumulative structure of images and motifs is coherent, and the flashback to the circus train’s heyday tilts the present without derailing momentum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he carries the train’s chime and the fragment’s lesson into his workshop—but the stakes are modest and their cost is mostly conceptual. Nothing crucial breaks, yet escalation feels more like deepening enchantment than pressured decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: library → scarf ritual → geometric manipulation → activation → partial retreat/charged intent. Causality is legible (her method leads to the scarf’s awakening and to the glimpse of the story-realm), and the piece lands in a recognizable Charged Poise: the portal is half-open, her quest sharpened. That said, the “reawakening” and its implications arrive and subside quickly, so the decisive change in options and cost is more conceptual than dramatically pressed. A slightly deeper dramatization of the pull to cross over or the risk of not doing so would make the before/after more forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the cipher → learning the condition (sunrise photography) → multi-dawn attempts → final capture as an image. Structure is linear and legible with one primary tightening (palette depletion and repeated failed dawns leading to the third dawn’s success). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dream is “captured” but only as an eternal absence/presence in light, with a felt cost. The only minor weakness is that the backstory about the stormy eve remains summarized rather than dramatized, slightly distancing the inciting loss.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a coherent causal arc: traveler arrives with a soul-lock, ritual disorients and frees her idea, which then catalyzes the locksmith’s own shift. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—he begins to apply his craft to himself, charged by her success and the talismanic hair. Structure is essentially one extended scene plus a brief echo, but the final third drifts into mantra-like repetition instead of tightening options or cost. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with sufficient but not exceptional discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: decades-old fairy encounter → lifelong gap → return to site → study of mushrooms/constellations → invocation → memories restored. The story uses a single continuous scene with one well-anchored flashback and lands a clear Decisive Change: he exits with reclaimed memories and broken habits. Cost is present but modest, mostly conceptual (recognizing his life’s pursuit as both cause and cure of loss) rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off. Structure is tight and legible under a causal-with-lyric-texture lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: Kai’s reversible exile → leaf-reading/annotation trial → shadow-in-glass complication → sigil completion and reintegration. The structure holds a single throughline with one substantive tightening at the moment the shadow is trapped and must be released by precise annotation. Closure lands on-page with Kai’s exile literally reversed and Elara returning to her work, a credible Earned Stasis for her. The main weakness is that the trial feels somewhat frictionless—no real risk of failure in the climax—so the cost of success is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: fading wonder → heirloom seed → ritual of essence-capture → gift to Elowen → tree in the square restores color. Closure is decisive and fully on the page, but escalation is smooth and low-friction, with no meaningful obstacle or reversal beyond a brief mention of “doubt.” The structure (single scene with a brief coda in the village) is appropriate to the length and never disorienting. The cost of success, however, is barely felt, keeping the arc from a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous scene, clear causal chain (secret → discovery of net → unraveling → release of spirits → self-reconfiguration), and a legible closure where Lirien and the sanctuary are both changed. The drive reads primarily causal with a strong accumulative texture in the repeated knot-unraveling. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the net undone and Lirien’s stance toward his unrest shifted, and the cost—emotional labor, lingering memory knots—is present though somewhat muted. A touch more friction in the final knot or a sharper sense of what failure would cost could raise the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: map tear → research and footage comparison → field visit → fissure and stair discovery → keystone pressed → letters found → map re-framed. Orientation is solid from the opening—who, where, and what he’s doing are clear, and the single POV holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias returns to the vault changed, with the map and chapel symbol recontextualized. The main weakness is low resistance; each step unfolds a bit too smoothly, so escalation feels linear rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous dive sequence where each step (descent → discovery of globe → note → reflection → epiphany → release/ascension) follows clearly. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with motifs (Earhart, transmission, entanglement, Elias) building toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is present and legible: she reframes death/letting go via the globe and transmission and chooses to leave, emotionally sated. Stakes remain philosophical rather than situationally urgent, but for this mode they are sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival, discovery of the living graffiti, encounter with the ghost, retrieval and use of the plate, and release of the ghost in a single continuous scene. Causality is solid and legible under a mostly causal-with-lyric-accumulation lens (“because she can hear the ghost, she acts; because she acts with the plate, the ghost is freed”). Closure is on-page and coherent—the ghost’s liberation and the thunder-as-voices provide a resonant before/after. The main limitation is that the resolution feels too smooth, with no serious complication or cost impinging on the protagonist’s plan.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine—elevator ascent mapped to diary revelations culminating in an identity reveal—is clean and legible, with a clear before/after at the top floor. The closure unit (her realization and resolve as she steps out) lands conceptually and structurally. However, the “Wait, too many—trimming in mind...” and word-count intrusions fracture immersion and briefly feel like an authorial aside rather than part of the fictional moment. Conflict is almost entirely informational, so while structure is neat, the stakes never quite feel pressured by time or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: string snaps → drifting observation and remembrance → conceptual proof → deliberate relinquishment and transmission via origami log. Causality is coherent under a mostly accumulative/textural lens; each new cloud-emotion and void sighting deepens the same central drive rather than scattering it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he redefines deathly isolation as the necessary condition for proving his thesis and preserving Lira. The main weakness is that physical stakes (his impending death) largely recede after setup, so the sense of narrowing external options doesn’t intensify on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a pre-demolition window with a clear causal chain (sneaking in → discovering the coin → decoding → building the mirror array → demolition), capped by a months-later epilogue that reweights the outcome. Orientation is strong from the opening and never slips; the ticking clock of demolition tightens toward the finish. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the library is destroyed but her sky endures in the salvaged wood, and her anonymity is reaffirmed with a different weight. The one limitation is that no turn significantly disrupts her plan once it begins, so the path to success feels relatively unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: strange luminance → investigation/decoding → discovery of coordinates → starling threat → activation of the board → ship empowered and redirected. Structure holds as one coherent scene with a decisive change in situation and options at the end. The closure is solid but relatively low-cost—nothing significant is sacrificed or irreversibly lost, and the danger from the starlings resolves quickly once introduced. Within the short length, though, the arc feels complete and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: prophecy → hall of mirrors → assembly → unsealing → reconfiguration → brief epilogue. Causality holds throughout, and the closure—Elias leaving with the “rhythm of repair” re-understood as emotional as well as mechanical—is on the page with a clear before/after. The brief summarizing coda about his later reputation is efficient and doesn’t undercut the main arc. Escalation is more spiritual than logistical, but it coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost appears → messages → investigation of the garden → discovery and hauling of the bell → collective ringing → restoration. Structure is largely expository, but it stays coherent and moves toward a legible decisive change with orchards revived and Lir departing. Cost is present but light—mostly prior despair and the risk of trusting a ghost without a strong on-page test of failure. Still, the arc reads complete and the closure unit is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: we move from ascent and setup, through method revelation, to execution and aftermath in a single, coherent scene. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: his long-standing vow → method via nested patterns → song through the pane → partial rollback of the Doomsday Clock. Closure lands clearly with cost (puppet crumbling, lighthouse and Elias fading), and there are no orientation issues. The only limitation is that the path to success feels somewhat foregone, with little doubt that the ritual will work.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: travelers enter → Elias retrieves blueprint and nuts → he marks the maze → they escape as frost arrives → he returns to his post. The labyrinth rules, nut mechanics, and bird behavior are all introduced before they matter, and the ticking frost clock is carried through to closure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to a burdensome role with a felt emotional cost. There are no major orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: past pollution → grief and guilt → ravine visit → foam insight → new polymer → partial atonement. The time jump to “months later” is efficient and closure (restored ravine, returning butterflies, reconverged path) is legible with a clear before/after. Still, the resolution feels frictionless—no resistance in the lab, no failed attempts or external pushback—flattening the sense of price. The insight itself also borders on convenient revelation rather than a hard-won structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-tense lull → quantified-absence ritual → slate fracturing → descent into the cloud vortex, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the “origin” is redefined as the blank, quantified void—and Elias pays a visible cost by abandoning his shop and identity. Causal links are soft but legible within the lyric frame (tallies → incisions → glimmer → map → choice to descend). The brief zoom-out to legend and new customers still reads under the same drive, though it edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: rare rain → puddles → revealed stairwell → pavilion → memory pools → decision to process them → ascent transformed. The piece uses a mostly causal drive with some textural accumulation in the pavilion, and closure lands on the page with a legible before/after. The main weakness is that the line from dream to discovery is accepted without friction; it works symbolically but slightly softens the sense of real-world contingency and cost. Still, for this length, the structure is coherent and the ending’s Decisive Change is well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara identifies the rift, devises the pulley bridge using the cuckoo weight, executes the plan, and then conducts the reconciliatory talks. The structure is linear and coherent with a clear before/after—siloed communities become literally and figuratively linked. Closure is present but somewhat soft; the long-standing conflict dissolves rapidly once the bridge is up and she sings, with little resistance or concrete cost on the page. Still, for this length, the single decisive operation and its immediate payoff land.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens: the ritual with the mirror intensifies visions until her identity reconfigures. Causality is soft but coherent—adjusting the mirror leads to progressively deeper entanglement and finally to her fused tool/role and vow. Closure lands: she crosses a before/after line from rejected engineer to dedicated dream-archeologist, with her old life effectively foreclosed. The cost of this choice (loss of prior self/normalcy) is more conceptually than viscerally rendered, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: manuscript → grotto → gravity inversion → threshold → inner chamber → return, with one legible transition. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening and the inversion-hour rule pays off structurally at the end. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: she acquires guarded knowledge and exits with new capacity. The main weakness is that the cost of success remains conceptual rather than dramatized, softening the impact of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the insulator → preparation of the sculpture → performance → altered grove and departure. Causality is straightforward and intact, and orientation (who/where/when, plus the Great Stillness) lands early without confusion. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: after the performance, the grove and Elowen share a new, charged hush, with a clear before/after. The cost is subtle but legible in the persistent stillness and the sense that this is one hard-won symphony against a vast silence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive at nexus → ritual of correlation → partial restoration → departure, all in one continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Causality is legible under a Hybrid/Causal–Accumulative lens: each piece-placement and silence-translation gradually escalates until the final “profound, covenant-deep quiet” reveals the fracture and enables the partial repair. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive fix, with a clear before/after in the covenant’s state and Elias’s understanding. Stakes skew abstract and world-scale without a concrete on-page test beyond tremors and monolith hums, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: locked diary → inventive nonviolent solution → successful opening just before the fireworks, with a clear temporal arc and pay-off. Causality holds and the accumulative/textural lens (building toward capturing a particular silence) is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reclaims his catalog and inscribes this silence, reweighting his project. The main limitation is that the cost of potential failure never quite bites, so the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: acquiring the seed → nurturing it through the village’s motion → enduring the bloom → reconfiguring her relationship to motion and smell. Time elides in a controlled way (“Days blurred,” “Weeks passed”) while pressure and scent intensify, and the corpse flower’s full bloom provides a clear climax. Closure is on-page and legible as a reweighted stance (conceptual repricing) rather than a large external turn, but it suits the lyric, accumulative design. The main ceiling is that external stakes remain modest and there’s little sense of options truly narrowing beyond “endure the bloom or fail,” limiting structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: inversion window → ascent via water flows → discovery of nexus → removal of arrow → return and planting for closure, all under a single continuous drive. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the inversion rule is taught and then paid off structurally. Closure is a decisive change—Elara literally relocates the planet’s growth engine to her home grove—though the cost of depriving the original nexus remains under-explored on the page. A bit more friction or consequence around taking the arrow would move this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal throughline—investigation → data-gathering → reconstruction of the crash → formal conclusion—is clean and easy to follow. The move from outer stacks to the crater provides a mild escalation and the final report constitutes a clear closure beat with conceptual cost. Some key story beats (AI failure, engineer’s warnings) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens impact. Overall structure is solid but not yet razor-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a single, continuous scene with clean causal flow: Elyra arrives, hesitates, engages the sheet and bells, and reconfigures the cavern’s hush. Closure is solid as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush is altered, the amber sheet is spent, and the world above is implicitly changed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds by layering description and symbolic stakes rather than plot twists—which holds consistently to the end. Cost is present but subtle, mostly conceptual and lodged in the “spent” relic and the irrevocable alteration of a perfect silence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: failed guardianship → journey to the range → markers → ritual → traversal → confrontation with the echo of failure → return changed. The structure (single throughline with one excursion into the other world) is easy to follow and closure is legible as a decisive internal change. The echo-world confrontation, however, is summarized quickly and lacks obstacles or complications that might deepen the climax. Costs and stakes are mostly asserted rather than tested in concrete beats, keeping this short of top-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: Elias primes the press → Mira arrives with fear → the ambiguous broadsheet triggers transposed empathy → feedback loop forces a frantic recalibration → partial mastery and a quiet new equilibrium. The story holds to one continuous scene with a legible before/after and a conceptual price (they’ve both been altered by the experiment; the fragment is spent). Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “emotion as equation” and of the halo’s power, with stakes paid in psychic disruption rather than external consequence. Some beats feel a touch schematic (the math realization arrives in declarative sentences) which slightly blunts the sense of hard-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—Kael on the ridge, the fork, the encounter, the pendant’s activation, then the mythic reframing of Thorne—builds cleanly and lands in a resonant reconfiguration where Thorne’s absence becomes a “seed.” Causality is simple but coherent: pendant → vision-sharing → Lira’s shift → Kael’s reconception of his role. Closure is on the page and legible, with a clear before/after in how Kael understands his work and his mentor. A sharper mid-scene micro-turn or concrete complication (e.g., Lira nearly refusing, or a risk to giving up the pendant) would strengthen pressure without changing the design.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clear: a single primary scene of investigation and revelation, followed by brief lab and return codas that reweight what happened at the arbor. Causality is coherent and accumulative: empirical setup → prism/frost reading → words in frost → emotional reckoning → paper/return, with each step tightening his options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—his worldview and relationship to objects and data are permanently altered, and the cost of living a double truth is legible. A few summary compressions (“Memories flooded”) blunt some moment-to-moment pressure that could have sharpened the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: isolated status quo → discovery of puzzle edges → construction of scaffold → recommenced rite → life-force sacrifice → tapestry’s departure and distant response. Closure lands decisively with Elara’s death and the message reaching its target, giving a clear before/after with cost. Structure is essentially linear with one main turn (finding and using the puzzle edges), and while effective, it offers limited complication or testing of her resolve beyond execution of the plan. Orientation and stakes are legible throughout, making the piece structurally sound and publishable with minor deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: collapsing arches → past loss → barter for silk → experiment in the shaft → awakened stones → partial planetary stabilization. The piece maintains single-POV continuity and orients place and stakes early, with one coherent throughline. Closure qualifies as a Decisive Change: Elar discovers and deploys a repeatable method that visibly alters the world’s trajectory. The main structural weakness is how smooth the process runs once he starts—no setback or complication tests the method, so escalation feels more like a successful montage than a pressured turning point with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: wake → shard activation → successive parallel-world revelations → confrontation at the nexus → choice to embrace the weave. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: each redirect leads to deeper information about her origin and raises the metaphysical stakes. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing when she fuses with the shard and accepts her role as a stabilizing stitch between worlds. The main weakness is some repetition in the middle “redirect” sequence, which flattens momentum slightly before the nexus moment.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal spine—lamp failure → climb to lantern room → discovery of stone-code letters → Elias’s vow/note → departure at dawn—is sound and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. However, the text breaks into visible drafting notes (“No—that exceeded; trim in mind…” etc.), which fracture temporal continuity and undercut the ending’s clarity. The brief contradictory beats about helping Harlan vs. descending alone add to the sense of an unclean final pass. Structure is basically there but not yet publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: routine → prophetic vision in the wick → decision to alter the beam → summoning of shadows → reconfigured dawn. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and the drive lens (causal with some accumulative texture) holds through closure. The closure—a conceptual repricing of “dawn” as balanced with primordial dark—lands, but the cost is mostly abstract and offstage. Because opposition never materializes, the climax feels more like an unopposed activation than a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that tracks a clear experiment (following the sun trails) which culminates in a revelation and reconfiguration of her relationship to the heart’s power. Causality is legible—she comes because of the stories, uses her dye-mastery to test a hypothesis, and the light-triggered pattern produces a concrete new understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/RR: the donor’s history and the wing’s warning recast her gift as dangerous and demand a new stance. Stakes stay relatively modest and internal, but they are coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: find the broken sextant → decision to deconstruct via dreams → staged repairs → corridor climax with the oaks’ vision → reassembly and repurposing. Causality is intact under a mostly accumulative lens, and the conceptual repricing at the end (what and how we measure) reads clearly. However, the pressure on each step is low; there’s little sense of what might be lost if he failed or refused, so the closure cost is more intellectual than felt. Still, it’s a well-shaped, publishable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: the dying orchard and endless night, the three-song ritual with gathering spirits, and the successful rekindling provide a clear arc with on-page closure. Causality under an accumulative/lyric lens holds: each song intensifies the weave and participation, leading to the Heart Tree’s rebirth. The cost is somewhat soft—the night’s resistance and Elara’s pain are brief and quickly overcome—so the climax feels inevitable rather than precarious. Still, the before/after of the realm and of Elara’s role is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the young man’s arrival with the invitation triggers Elara’s reconsideration of her past mistake, leading her to the mezzanine, the hidden door, and full re-entry into the Order. The structure holds as a single mostly continuous scene with a clear before/after, and the closure (she joins and reframes hiding as a paradoxical form of presence) is legible. However, the implied danger (“I fear it’s a trap”) never materializes as actual tested risk; the Order is immediately welcoming, which softens the sense of cost. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal with thematic/accumulative texture) and holds, but the decisive turn lacks a strong on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: present ritual → memory and guilt → Mira’s arrival → partial absolution and future vow, with no orientation issues. Causality is modest but coherent: his preservation of the bread and creation of the garden bring him to a moment where sharing both with Mira becomes the decisive emotional turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (their relationship thawing, the garden becoming shared), with a visible emotional cost in facing his complicity and her loneliness. The drive lens is more textural than strongly causal, so escalation feels gentle rather than sharply tightening, keeping this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: he discovers decay, escalates sampling, synthesizes a chord, and stabilizes the vows and library, which supplies closure. The causal chain is soft but present—measuring leads to understanding the decay curve, which enables the resonant chord—but the cost of failure and the difficulty of success remain abstract. The library’s drift and deepening cold hint at consequences, yet obstacles never seriously threaten his progress. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change with palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: each failed attempt plausibly informs her escalation to a public confrontation, and the wax cylinder payoff is set up and paid off. The closure is strong—a decisive change where the pirate truce collapses and the recording captures the cost—without any orientation issues. If anything, the pirates’ turn from hush to chaos feels a bit easy; more resistance or partial belief might have added complexity. Still, the before/after is undeniable and the chain of “because/therefore” holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: she climbs the bluff because of her question, the ring reacts, she follows it to the weather-walkers, receives an explanation, and reinterprets weather-carriers. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “weather-carriers” and her own stance, with a clear before/after. However, the stakes remain mostly intellectual/spiritual, and the bracketed self-referential “Wait, adjust… [Word count calibrated]” lines at the end feel like extraneous scaffolding that blur the final cadence. The drive lens reads as accumulative/lyric with a causal spine and holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: return to cave → confront ruined lock → recall hidden mechanism → repair and open box → resume sketching. Structure is a single coherent scene with a clear before/after and a decisive change at the end. The cost is mostly emotional and retrospective rather than acutely felt in the scene, but it’s legible as rectifying a “self-inflicted wound.” No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the causal drive holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discover/reassemble the zinc map → follow its directions through increasingly dishonest spaces → locate the vault → reprice her own past via the mentor’s stored candor and choose to share. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing with cost: she stops chasing “phantoms” and reframes loss as unspoken truth, accepting the hurt of her mentor’s lie. The structure—quest through layered undercity into a single revelatory vault scene—fits the length and keeps orientation clear despite the lushness. A minor limitation is that the risks on the journey (her wilting, toxic environment) are gestured at more than truly tested, so the sense of narrowing options could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: iceberg falls, she conceives and builds the sculpture, the music transforms pilgrims, and she continues tending it against entropy. Causality is coherent and the closure, an earned stasis where she accepts ongoing toil as guardian of wonder, is legible. That said, most of the “stakes” (loss of wonder, muting of truth) are explained rather than enacted in live dilemmas or turns, so cost at the climax feels somewhat abstract. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: magnetic shift → dome destabilization → roses & fears mutate → containment/miniaturization → controlled burn, with each beat logically arising from the previous. The global drive reads as Hybrid leaning Causal: physical crisis and inner static interweave and resolve together. Closure is decisive and on-page (burning the box; dome stabilizing; nostalgia reconfigured), with a legible cost in losing the “childhood fears” artifacts. Structure is linear and well-contained for the length, without orientation problems or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: locket → legend → dawn gathering → layered clues in stories → dial discovery → mailbox opening → communal reading and healing. Closure lands decisively with both a solved mystery and a reconfigured community dynamic, and the cost appears as long-suppressed emotions surfacing. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, though the puzzle resolves rather smoothly, with little sense of risk of failure. The ending cadence fits the established drive lens and provides a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: descent → journal/dice decoding → AI confrontation via dance → vault opening → secondary revelation of cryo-pods → revival and ascent. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some lyric accumulation, and closure is achieved through decisive change (data recovered, colleagues freed, Elara’s solitary struggle refigured as collective). However, the obstacles tend to yield on first contact, and the hinted environmental threat (hull groans, instability) never forces a genuine tactical pivot. Structural shape is strong but lacks a turn where options narrow with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: beached whale → gravity anomalies → descent to chamber → coffee divination → excavation → heart → embedding it among crystals. Structure holds as a single throughline with one escalation band and a clear closure unit (he re-situates the heart and redefines his role), so the before/after is legible. Cost is implicit—he abandons his former life and takes on a quasi-sacred burden—but not heavily stressed. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the causal drive is straightforward and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: prophecy → ritual preparation → mapping silence → enactment → prophecy hushed, with a clear Decisive Change at the end. However, escalation is soft; the prophecy’s threat remains largely summarized and internal, and the ritual proceeds without a concrete setback or constraint that tests his plan. The “visions of skies fracturing, brooks boiling into voids” gesture at cost but appear late and vanish quickly, with no real impact on tactics. Closure is present but feels somewhat frictionless, more like watching a procedure succeed than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: move-in → sugar/tea ritual → deepening suspicion → rooftop confrontation → revelation and handover of the seal, with a clear before/after in their pact of lies dissolving. The summary of “week after week” compresses the middle effectively but also flattens on-page beats that could have made the escalation more felt rather than told. Closure is solid—Elara’s goal is achieved with a defined new status (initiated speaker of the building’s tongue)—but the actual shift from resistance to agreement on Harlan’s part comes swiftly once she presses him. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture from repeated motifs (seal, whispers), and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene where the goal (archive the quarantined memory before dawn) drives a clear progression through preparation, risk, and completion. Causality is strong and legible—she performs specific steps, pressure mounts, memory breaches, pain is channeled, and the seashell absorbs it—culminating in a decisive change. Closure is solid: the memory is archived, quarantine dissolved, and her stance toward her past and self reconfigured with cost. The main limitation is that the path feels somewhat frictionless; doubt is voiced but never seriously complicates tactics or introduces a true risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: past treason → present ritual of unlinking → exit into a new state, with clear causal steps (thorn, blood, counter-strokes, severed edicts). Closure is solid: the “invisible chain snap” and his departure from the sanctuary mark a decisive change with a legible before/after. The cost is mostly internal and conveyed in conceptual terms, with little sense that the unmaking imperils him or others beyond abstract destiny. The accumulative/lyric drive holds, but the outcome feels assured from early on, so tension in the ritual never quite peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: the meeting at the nexus, successive whispers, rising tension with the merchant, and a decisive climax followed by a reflective denouement. Causality holds under a mostly causal/accumulative lens—each whisper advances knowledge and stirs reactions, culminating in the merchant’s lunge and binding. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing and a small decisive change, though the on-page cost to Elyra is slight and mostly abstract. Orientation is strong; no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is strong: she retrieves the snow globe, uses it to summon dream-cameos, assembles the pattern, confronts the mate’s ghost, and extracts the locket, which brings peace. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative/lyric texture—the sequence of cameos is clearly patterned and each adds specific information narrowing toward the culprit. Closure is solid: the ghosts’ release and the recovered locket give a concrete before/after and fulfill the “salvage purity” goal. The main limitation is that the investigation proceeds a bit too smoothly; no serious structural complication or setback tests her premise or method.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: rain → parapet reflection → firefly-guided descent → net-mending → return, with a clear before/after in his reaffirmed philosophy. Causality is gentle but legible (whistles shape fireflies, moon paths guide his movement, the found net gives the night a task). Closure lands as a quiet earned stasis/conceptual repricing: he reclaims his role as net-mender philosopher with a deepened appreciation. The main limitation is that no turn meaningfully constrains his options; the arc is linear and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrive → test orchard → investigate house → reconstruct letters → discover tech → confront ethical dilemma → choose secrecy. The Great Liquidation and creditor backstory are efficiently folded in and clearly motivate why this tech is dangerous in the wrong hands. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, with his decision to preserve the lie and walk away underlining a before/after in his mission. A minor weakness is that the creditor sabotage is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly reducing the felt weight of that plot line.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an accumulative/lyric causal lens: building the receiver → receiving prophecies → gathering followers → sabotage → final broadcast, all coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: prophecy fulfilled yet undercut by the warning that “shadows devour their shapers,” and his wondering if dawn will blind or burn. However, the cost remains mostly hypothetical; no concrete, irreparable loss manifests on the page. The montage structure compresses his “rise” effectively but flattens the sense of a single decisive turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → crate/music box → flawed melody → sweetening experiment → market test with grandmother/child → return to loft with renewed purpose. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in how his work is received. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (his mission validated, doubt eased), but the cost is gentle—no serious risk or sacrifice on the page. Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation is present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: wraiths are drawn to the key, Elias retreats to the lighthouse, uses the key in the console, tunes to their frequency, and resolves the threat. Orientation is established quickly (who/where/when), and the scene proceeds linearly with one dominant drive. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with emotional cost—wraiths absolved, marina transformed, Elias altered—but the victory feels somewhat frictionless given the scale of stakes, with no real risk of failure once he starts tuning. A touch more resistance or complication in the climax would deepen the sense of earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: lake freezing + mapped moon paths + post-rain viaduct state create a clear window for sabotage, culminating in a decisive unyoking that changes the world. Structure is straightforward but effective—preparation in the sanctuary, crossing the ice, scaling the viaduct, then the act and its immediate consequences. Closure is strong: both external (neural yokes fall silent) and internal (impatience sculpted into patience) with a legible before/after. The operation itself succeeds a bit too smoothly, with few complications in the sabotage beat, slightly limiting perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with interleaved visions that clearly arise from the lantern and train vibrations, leading causally to Elara’s decisive break from Marcus. The inciting incident (worker’s death) sets up both the professional frame and the thematic premise of “preventable” harm, which then refracts into her personal life. Closure is solid: she severs Marcus’s hold and reframes her task from reporting a death to preventing one (her own), with a clear before/after. The cost is present but somewhat conceptual; consequences beyond the broken phone and implied danger remain offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the storm, organized around the attempt to repair the clockwork heart and Elias’s internal reckoning. Causality is legible—Elias’s guilt → bringing the box → Harrow’s work → the heart’s revival → Elias’s reorientation—culminating in a clear conceptual reconfiguration about “second opinions.” The lightning/light beam that “helps” the mechanism read as a mildly convenient grace note and slightly softens the sense of earned resolution, but doesn’t break logic. Closure lands: before, guilt without repair; after, a resolved commitment with a felt cost in the awareness that Marcus will not personally benefit.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain from acid sea → recovered arrow → decoding → algorithm → ascendant fleets is coherent and easy to follow, and the piece lands a conceptual before/after in the world’s relationship to machines. The structure is largely summarative across a long timespan, with beats compressed rather than dramatized, which flattens moment-to-moment pressure. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—the world redefined by yearning machines—but the cost of that shift is only faintly implied (possible mutiny, hubris) rather than concretely felt. As a result, the global drive reads more accumulative than causally tight at key turns, keeping this out of publish-ready territory.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is solid: anomaly → investigation → lie for access → revelation → corporate backlash. The structure holds to a single throughline with a clear before/after realization about “deleted” consciousness, which provides closure. Some beats, like the audit bot lock and job loss, are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the impact of the climax. The meta bracket insertions (“[412—no, recount properly.]”) momentarily fracture immersion but don’t fundamentally break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: feud → parley → discovery/use of the fragment + mirrors → reconstituted orb → peace. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (Decisive Change: war averted) with a legible before/after, and orientation is strong from the opening. However, the resolution feels nearly frictionless once Thorne begins the ritual, and the looming war never seriously tests options on the page. The cost of success—personal, political, or magical—remains mostly implied rather than dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: wake in tent → join trawl → near-epiphany with drowning woman → night rupture with parasol → dock conversation and realization. Causality is subtle but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each beat narrowing from abstract quest to Tomas’s intimate “hush” as closure. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where she shifts from tourist to witness and finds “home”—is legible and earned, with the parasol’s loss and her new stance marking cost. The piece leans more on atmosphere than hard plot turns, but at this length that choice holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: missed bus → forced walk → pavilion → encounter with Theo → reframing of her relationship. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with a brief embedded backstory that’s clearly cued and returned to in the present. Closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration as she leaves at dawn with a new understanding of her quarrel and future. The main limitation is that the middle sags into lecture-like backstory rather than escalating present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: we move from pavilion to dunes to parapet to a calm return, with each step deepening the ritual rather than breaking causality. Closure lands cleanly—“Preservation complete” and the humming parapet mark a before/after—but the cost of success is nearly frictionless. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and it holds, yet the ritual never seriously risks failure or forces a different path. The ending offers a resonant image more than a decisive, pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: Elara arrives, prepares, the townsfolk gather, the ritual unfolds, and she departs, with closure in the completed “masterpiece” and her renewed purpose. Causality is soft but coherent—each phase grows out of the prior one without contradictions or temporal confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s relationship to the factory’s trauma and the field is reweighted. The absence of real setbacks or turns limits structural tension but not basic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: crystal → echoes → pattern → testimony → reweighted world-rule at the end. Causality is internally consistent (picking up and tapping the crystal yields sequences that lead her to testify), and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the first lines. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “end of words” is reframed as a pause, with her recorded testimony as persistent counterpressure to the hush, and there is a legible emotional cost to her defiance. The drive lens (accumulative) holds from mid-story through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean quest structure: he wants to capture a sound, lays a navigation method (driftwood and chalk), tracks the nexus, records it, and replays it, with each step causally linked. The drive lens reads Hybrid, skewing Accumulative/Textural, but causality remains coherent and oriented from early on (who/where/when are legible in the first paragraphs). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the same motifs—echoes, chalk, tidal longing—are reweighted when he finally listens back and his longing quiets. Cost is subtle but present in the acceptance that the sound itself will “grow older with every loop,” acknowledging decay even in his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: moonquake → clock anomaly at escape velocity → threat to observation/observatory → Elias’s repair gambit → restored timing and captured pulsar. The story maintains one scene, one POV, and a single dominant drive, with the bonsai/leaf threaded in as a concrete pivot that redirects his tactics. Closure is solid—a decisive change in the clock and a resonant reconfiguration of his relation to time—with a legible before/after. The only limitation is that the solution comes fairly straightforwardly once the leaf is noticed, so the struggle phase is slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: diagnosis → Elara’s ritual work → Lena’s arrival → reconciliation → death, with each step causally linked. The accumulative, ritualized “hymning” pattern is taught early and carries through to closure without confusion. Closure is solid—a resonant reconfiguration in which the goodbye is completed and Harlan dies at peace, with the vinyl shard as a charged final image. The main structural weakness is how frictionless Lena’s arrival and reconciliation are; no serious hurdle tests Elara’s plan, so the climax feels somewhat procedurally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the key → unlocking sealed automatons → closing rune loops → revelation of the shadow-vault access. The global drive is Causal, and the closure (gaining the map/location and conceptual reframing of noon shadows) lands clearly on the page. However, the stakes feel more like intellectual puzzle-solving than a pressured decision with visible cost, so the ending reads as the completion of a prologue rather than a climax. No orientation or lens penalties apply; structure is solid but not breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—substitute body → maze → garden → tooth → ritual → inner reconfiguration—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clean single-POV throughline and no orientation issues. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, but each discovery reasonably “because/therefore” leads to the next, and the closure (belief reweighted, tooth fused) reads as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the external stakes (the actual changeling swap, the village child) remain off-page and unresolved, which softens the sense of concrete cost at the end. Structure is tidy and unified but slightly too comfortable given the grim inciting premise.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: discovery of sea glass → decision to polish → transformation into a light-source → presentation to the village → communal uptake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with Elara’s role and the village’s relationship to light clearly changed and the cost of her earthbound choice still in force. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and it holds: layered memories and craft work build to a reweighted final image. However, escalation is gentle and obstacles are minimal, so the sense of options narrowing or real risk remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: icicle-message summons → meeting → pendant offer → quiet emotional reconfiguration, all causally linked and easy to follow. The closure beat—Elara relinquishing the pendant and the viral storm receding in importance—is on the page with an intelligible before/after. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative texture), and the lens holds to the end. The main limitation is that the external “viral” situation never meaningfully complicates or narrows options within the scene; it remains an off-stage pressure rather than an active structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a sequence of four cameos, each ritualized with the seashell, building toward a renewed commitment to the manuscript. Causality is straightforward and legible—visions appear, he nearly loses them, he intervenes—without teleporting props or broken rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with an “alive” manuscript and a different relationship to his work. The main limitation is that cost and jeopardy remain relatively soft, so the final before/after is conceptually clear but not sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: blight and lost rituals → Elowen’s invention and song → loom spins stories → community remembers and land heals. The piece carries a single, continuous scene with a clear before/after and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (practices restored, arbor renewed). However, escalation is linear and untroubled; there’s no genuine risk of failure once the alignment starts, which softens the sense of earned closure. Structure is solid but feels somewhat pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single-ritual arc: discovery of the plate, painstaking preparation, ignition, revelation of the map, and his decision to follow. Causality is tight—each step of the alchemy depends on the previous one—and the accumulative drive lens (ritual building toward vision) holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reinterprets Eira’s “end” as a path and chooses to act on that knowledge, with emotional cost visible on the page. Orientation is clear from the opening, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: he descends, experiments through changing light, hits partial successes, then full activation and departure, with a legible before/after. Causality is coherent—specific angles and times produce concrete gear clicks—and the repetition of trials gives a sense of progression. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he ascends with a filled “cellar of reason,” options meaningfully reweighted by the new tool. That said, the central drive reads more procedural than pressured, with little sense that failure or delay would materially change his situation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is coherent: yearly ritual → weaving burdens → fractals overgrow and trap her → she recalls ancestral method → orients burner → calcification frees her as monument. Causality is clean and legible under an accumulative/lyric lens, with the burner and starlight set up before they matter. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (she is reconfigured with the grotto/monument) though that cost could be sharpened. No orientation debt; the scene and temporal frame are clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: one continuous scene framed by the boiling kettle, with a clear before (uncontained crystals and unresolved grief) and after (a locket containing “eternity”). Causality is solid—her decision to carve the blank flows from the stated problem of scattered crystals and the established crystallized-time magic. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis, though the cost is more conceptual than sharply felt, which softens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: carousel halts → Elias uses the wheel to gather fragments → pressure mounts → ghost manifests → negotiation → renunciation and descent. Causality is intact and readable even within the chronologically confused conceit; the wheel’s operation, the ghost’s emergence, and Elias’s final choice all follow coherent “because/therefore” links. Closure (Elias abandoning the carousel’s promise and choosing grounded life) is decisively on the page with a visible cost. Some midsection repetition of regret fragments blurs escalation slightly, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: she sneaks in, finds the sextant, maps flows, reroutes systems, and reactivates the resonator, which provides a clear before/after. Closure is on the page—the terminal “lived” versus “dead”—but the lack of significant resistance or complication means escalation never meaningfully tightens her options. All set-ups (sextant, maze, flows) pay off, and orientation is solid from early on. The cost of success, however, is mostly conceptual rather than felt, which keeps the structure solid but not arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean, single sequence: scent → retrieval of the box → journey to forecourt → crystal awakening → internal reconfiguration, with no orientation issues and a stable accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dream isn’t dead but transformed, and he returns “ready to scribe clocks infused with melody’s ghost,” a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The causal chain is simple yet solid; nothing feels arbitrarily inserted or unresolved. Stakes remain modest and largely internal, which slightly limits the sense of structural inevitability demanded at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: approach → discovery of wreck → salvage → discovery of twin sundial → conceptual shift, all causally linked. Orientation is excellent and the single-scene progression is easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he reframes legends and lies—but the stakes remain mostly intellectual, with negligible consequence for failure. The lack of a sharper, costed turn keeps this below top-tier structural strength.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival on the dock, recognition of the rope’s significance, decoding, and a compact pact/closure. Causality is coherent—Elias’s noticing the patterns leads to the fulgurite, to decoding, to the vow to teach Kael’s son—and the accumulative/textural drive (knowledge accruing) is held consistently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s preservation mandate expands from seeds to encoded lore, with the boy’s future as implicit cost/continuation. The main limitation is that structural pressure remains gentle; nothing truly resists or derails the progression once the premise is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the thread → sequence of obituaries and projections → internal reconfiguration at the end. Causality under a textural lens holds: each obituary deepens his understanding until “In the garden’s embrace, he was whole” lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost—confronting his sister’s loss and weeping—is present but relatively gentle, and the outcome feels a bit tidy. Nonetheless, orientation is solid, the pattern is taught early, and closure reads legibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: find components → assemble device → hatchling emerges → revaluation of beauty and genesis. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, with tension built through increasingly vivid sensory and conceptual layering until the egg’s cracking and the palace’s violent shudder. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: beauty is revived but as fragile, destabilizing truce rather than salvation, with the suspended palace and world-gear reaction foregrounding cost. There are no serious orientation or causality breaks, though the external consequences remain mostly gestural rather than concretely followed through.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean single scene with interleaved backstory, culminating in the graft and whispered invocation, producing a clear resonant reconfiguration. Causality is simple but coherent: she arrives, performs her ritual, and internally reweights her relationship to her father and the land. The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive effectively, but the meta-artifacts (“Wait, over—trim”) briefly rupture immersion and undercut structural polish.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: paused city → stained glass box → decision not to force it → breadcrumb quest → key → box opens → city resumes. The single through-line scene with one clear goal gives satisfying closure and a legible “before/after” for the city. Cost is modest (mainly time and effort) and obstacles appear just when needed, so the structure reads elegant but a bit frictionless for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: transit toward the core and the gear’s projections gradually tighten into a single decisive act—embedding the gear in the throne. Causality is coherent: her awareness of generational loops and prior conflagrations directly motivates the chosen “soft” intervention, and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration where she relinquishes control and accepts a haunted vigil. The cost—her dimming, retreat, and continued haunting—is legible on the page, if quiet. Escalation is gentle and largely internal, but the before/after (personal tool vs distributed subtle oracle) remains clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—repeated dusks during the migration, more specters appearing, the ribbon unspooling toward the plague knot—builds coherently toward a Conceptual Repricing of “collective grief” as a weave. Causality is clean under a textural lens: because he returns, obeys “retrace,” and follows the ribbon, his understanding changes and the family specters can “nod” and depart. Closure lands clearly with cost: his tears, the dissolution of the specters, and his commitment to carve differently all mark a legible before/after. The only limit is that most turns are narrated in summary rather than dramatized in-scene, which slightly flattens the sense of discrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clean: lifelong sabotage-born guilt → disciplined clock-winding → magical confrontation with his ledger → psychological reconfiguration and release. The piece teaches its pattern early (dangerous ridge, daily winding as penance) and tightens into the single charged act of pressing the handle to the pendulum at the pause. Closure via resonant reconfiguration is clear and on-page: the before/after in his relation to time, ridge, and village is legible with the cost grounded in his spent life. Structure is straightforward and cohesive, though the magical mechanics are accepted rather than interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: nightly ritual → chess clock runs down → entry into the silo → decoding the tapestry → revelation and silencing of echoes. Structure is straightforward with one clear transition and a legible before/after in the status of the echoes and Elias’s understanding. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of the noblewoman’s story, but the lack of real impediment or risk keeps the stakes small. Orientation is strong and the drive lens (primarily causal with textural support) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal throughline is legible: Elias models, refines, and commits to writing in the face of enforcer pressure, all anchored clearly in time and place. The piece builds toward a Charged Poise closure at the instant before ink touches vellum, framed as the decisive threshold. However, the late omniscient declaration “Prevail he did, forever” undercuts that charged uncertainty without showing how or at what price he actually prevails, softening the ending’s impact. Structure is otherwise coherent and single-scene, but the cost at closure remains more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery/activation of the radio, escalating broadcast, dust awakening, distant pursuit, then a reconfigured world at the end. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the closure (stories returning via dust, Elara resuming her copying with altered stakes) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. However, the threat from authorities never materially tightens on the page, so the central line of pressure feels under-tested. The result is structurally sound but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: quiet setup in the gallery, deepening through the rocking chair’s history and his ritual, then the omen of the chair slowing that cues the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he completes the rite, scatters the ash, then removes the mask and doubts his own premise. Causality is coherent and the dominant stake (can he truly preserve her emotion, and what does that cost him?) carries through. The meta-editing intrusion in the final line is a structural blemish that momentarily breaks immersion and slightly dulls the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: cog discovery → narrative doubt → decision to dig through literal layers → discovery of logs/chronometer → reconstructed device and resolve to confront. The sedimentary excavation provides a clear structural spine with three escalating layers, and the closure—reassembling the chronometer and choosing to surface—is a legible decisive change with conceptual stakes. Cost is implied (risking confrontation and further isolation) rather than dramatized, but the before/after in his stance is solid. The piece stays in one temporal and spatial window with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: initial discord, procedural teaching via “subtracting noise,” then a time-compressed progression to a culminating choir moment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the group achieves seamless harmony and Elara reconceives “vanishing arts” as something reborn in people. However, escalation is mostly told in montage rather than built through distinct turning scenes, and the cost of failure/success never feels truly contingent. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, but the path to the endpoint feels almost foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: alignment → pruning → planting → first sprout → envisioned legacy; the piece builds to a clear closure image with conceptual cost (defying the Regime, risking erasure). Structure as a single, continuous scene with layered memories and worldbuilding is coherent and easy to follow. That said, much of the Regime conflict and the danger around the act is told rather than dramatized, so the cost remains mostly conceptual, not felt. Escalation is more assumed than tested on the page, which keeps the closure from fully landing at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → line at tower → Mira’s demand → curse pressure → box/riddle → Mira’s realization → decision to restore the hive. The global drive lens is Causal, with one clear tightening when Elias chooses the riddle workaround instead of a direct answer. Closure lands: Mira’s plan to seed new drones and climb the tower reconfigures the blackout from terminal failure to cycle, and Elias’ routine resumes with altered stakes. Cost is present but soft—emotional and conceptual rather than sharply dramatized risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: noticing → ritual with objects → revelation via the large shard → returning it and seeding communal practice. Causality broadly holds, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in Elias’s role and the bay’s vitality. The cost, however, is mostly conceptual (recognizing isolation and responsibility) rather than dramatized through a hard choice or visible loss. Everything unfolds with near-frictionless success, which softens impact at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: archive revelation → confrontation with Thalor → progressive visions → literal opening of the ampoule → decisive reframing of the ancestor’s act. Closure is solidly on the page with a before/after in Elara’s stance and a conceptual cost—she must surrender a comforting moral binary and reinhabit a tainted legacy. The “cascading revelations” structure is coherent and each layer meaningfully reweights the previous one rather than simply repeating. A minor limitation is that the archive event is off-stage, so the inciting beat’s emotional weight must be inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single causal arc from intention (attack perpetual motion) through attempt (proof-building) to consequence (rupture and re-formed prison). Closure is solidly an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he fails to escape but reconfigures his relationship to the climb and his regret. Causality around the die shattering and the staircase’s reaction is legible within the piece’s metaphysical rules. The main limitation is that the stakes and turns land more as conceptual shifts than as urgently felt, time-pressured beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: insomnia and doubt → ritual painting → moonlit visions of preserved kindness → projecting glyphs onto panes → city dwellers’ responses → earned rest. Structure is essentially a single, continuous scene with accumulative visionary shards, and the closure (he finally sleeps, belief reconfigured) lands clearly with cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a solid causal spine, and there are no orientation issues. Stakes stay intimate and philosophical rather than sharply tested, which keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: beekeeper’s prior warning → observed thaw → flood → discovery of scouts and opera house → organized flight. Structure holds as a single escalating scene with clear temporal and spatial logic, and closure lands when they decisively abandon Veilfall for a new refuge. The cost of leaving is sketched rather than deeply dwelt on, but the before/after is legible and carries weight. The opera house vision via the lens is a bit convenient yet still seeded enough not to break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causality is clean: low tide exposes the stone → Elias discovers and reverse-engineers the yoyo → he activates it via the stone and lighthouse, reversing the island’s history at the price of his life. The structure escalates in a single causal chain toward a decisive act, and closure is strong: the world’s fate is altered, Elias dies, the lighthouse’s new beam and legends crystallize a clear before/after. There are no significant orientation or logic slips despite the lyric mode. The only limitation is that some big turns (e.g., famine years reversing) are told in compressed summary rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the impact of otherwise excellent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is strong: resuscitation → cursed glow → advisor’s quest directive → dream dictionary ritual → exploitation of Fear’s weakness → escape. The story maintains a single through-line without tangents, and the closure beat (Fear’s dissolution, curse lifting, but lingering “victory curse”) lands cleanly with a legible before/after. Cost is articulated conceptually—she keeps the “repulsive allure” and a trajectory toward future shadows—rather than through a concrete sacrifice in-scene, slightly softening impact. Still, the structure is tight and the ending doesn’t sprawl into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scene follows a clean causal line: clouds → impending storm → Elowen’s decision to construct and play the xylophone → escalating waves and debris → harmonic dome repelling the final beam → calm. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world is still dangerous but now navigable through his method, with the orchard’s survival and his exhaustion as cost. The drive lens is Hybrid (causal with strong textural/accumulative escalation) and holds consistently. A slight softening is that the success of his music feels a bit assured—there’s little sense it might fail—but the structural spine is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is strong: years of mapping → method with the whistle → question to the watchers via the turtles → catastrophic crack and revelation that reprice everything. Closure is clear and costly: the story ends on the knowledge that Tortuga Spire is now accelerating toward the devouring horizon because Elara repeated the expedition’s transgression. Structure is tight—a single, escalating present scene buttressed by efficient backstory—with no orientation drift. The only limiter is that the “we are doomed and drifting faster” consequence is told fairly quickly rather than explored through one or two more concrete, situational consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is legible: arrival → discovery of letter → decoding → deeper search → corroborating ledgers → resolved stance. Closure works as a conceptual repricing of “noble lies,” with Elias leaving committed to publication and a reconfigured sense of heritage. However, the path is almost frictionless—vandals, risk, and moral ambiguity are asserted rather than dramatized as obstacles—so escalation feels intellectual more than structural. The latter third leans into summary (“In his next monograph…”) instead of keeping key beats on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one main, continuous scene with a brief, clearly signaled epilogue, and the causal chain (stay after drawbridge → tide rises → repairs with notes → later discovery) is coherent. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias has shifted from surveyor to “legend’s keeper,” with the diver’s discovery confirming cost and consequence. The main limitation is that escalation feels more like a steady layering of similar moves than a clearly differentiated structural turn, and the physical stakes never quite threaten to derail his project. Still, orientation is strong and there are no major causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → discovery of the stamp → alternative hypothesis test → coordinates → vault → revelation and new stance. Structure is tight for the length, with one dominant drive (trace the origins) and a clear closure beat where her understanding and role reconfigure. The main limitation is that the turns feel relatively frictionless—no serious setbacks or competing obligations challenge her path—so the Decisive Change lands more intellectually than viscerally. Still, the story satisfies closure requirements with a solid Conceptual Repricing of the city’s history.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain—shadow detaches → Elar seeks the tea garden and basilica → polishes dream-quartz → records grief in a lantern → uses the basilica to transform it—reads clean and motivated. Structure is linear with one clear escalation into the basilica ritual and a decisive before/after change. Closure lands solidly as both a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration with visible emotional cost (tears, essence poured, shadow finally released). No orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: experiment overloads → ten-minute blackout → she uses that gap to hunt and capture a vacuum energy pool. Closure is legible as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: she moves from survivor-scavenger to self-anointed sovereign with a charged tool. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with light backstory that doesn’t tangle chronology. The main limitation is how smoothly success comes; there’s little sense that options narrow or a real outcome is at risk, which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: pilgrim arrives with a broken chart → Elara recalls the chip → drones map star trails → lever pull decodes the “frequency of belonging.” The structure is linear and well-contained to a single situation, with no orientation issues and a legible before/after. Closure lands: both characters experience a decisive internal shift plus a fresh external anomaly that reframes their future. The cost is relatively soft (no sacrifice beyond vulnerability), which keeps the impact below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine is clean: terrace reflection → descent to shore → discovery of carvings/watch hand → confrontation with past → decision to tell the truth and abandon his trade. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he commits to “rebuild genuine lines,” with visible conceptual cost for his livelihood and self-concept. The coincidental specificity of the driftwood bearing Mira’s forged crest and matching initials strains plausibility slightly and feels under-motivated. Pressure stays mostly internal and reflective, with few on-page obstacles or turns beyond accumulating realization.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: past deception → war → prisoner exchange → symbolic reparation via the pull, all within one continuous, well-oriented scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara frees Tomas, surrenders the counterfeit, and gains a reframed conscience, while both sides commit to a new pattern. However, the exchange proceeds with little on-page uncertainty or friction—there’s no serious risk of collapse once Kael appears, so the climax feels more ceremonial than pressured. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, and though legible, it’s stated more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: launch → journey via poles under mounting inner backlash → rogue swell test → star/pole alignment → inlet landing with a reweighted outlook. Causality under a largely accumulative lens holds: his previous failures explain why he chooses this risky night paddle and why the small celestial sign matters so much. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where his stance toward regret and guidance changes with visible cost (tears, exhaustion, relinquishing self-condemnation as sole compass). Some middle beats feel slightly repetitive (regrets circling without new consequences), but the overall arc remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: wipe → clues in newspapers/baseball → journey through tunnels → confrontation at the lake → partial restoration of empathy. The orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the time-travel/baseball premise stays internally consistent enough for this length. Some elements are conveniently neat—newspapers forming a map, Elara already waiting as “foretold”—which softens tension and makes the path feel slightly pre-ordained rather than hard-won. Closure is on-page and legible, but the price of that closure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: fortune cookie → instructions → gathering spices → ritual → transformation → reunion, with a clear before/after closure as Elara and Thorne become immortal guardians. Structure is linear and oriented, with no confusing jumps. The sacrifice of humanity and the permanence of the new state are asserted but not deeply tested or problematized, so the decisive change lands more as a foregone, reward-heavy transition than a hard-won resolution. Still, the piece achieves a legible arc under a mainly causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: after the birth she seeks the glade, performs the ritual, discovers the clockwork, and makes a new choice for her daughter, with each step motivated by her drive to locate “where lost time accumulates.” The story maintains a single continuous scene with clear orientation and a legible before/after—she arrives crushed by regret and leaves with a reconfigured understanding and commitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing, with the mechanism in the swaddling and the descent from the clouds crystallizing the change. Stakes stay mostly internal, but the structure supports them without confusion or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and causal: Elara initiates the portal, confronts escalating inner shadows, stitches them into a tapestry, and uses that to unlock the quarantined dimension. Closure is solid: her internal integration directly enables the external breach, and the before/after is legible with an emotional cost. The drive lens reads as largely causal with a strong accumulative texture—each shadow confrontation meaningfully advances her toward the climax. Stakes are somewhat abstract and there’s little sense of what failure would concretely look like for her, but the arc itself is well-shaped and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias’s orchestrated “coincidences” draw people, his journey brings him to the beach at the precise celestial moment, and the accidental release of the lightning bugs fulfills the prophecy and calms the volcano, delivering closure. The ending carries a visible cost (loss of his last “treasure”) and a reconfiguration of purpose. Still, the prophecy arrives as a late explanatory overlay, and the crucial external resolution (volcano appeased, ailments cured) leans heavily on cosmic coincidence rather than on his explicit, pressured decision-making. Structure remains coherent and satisfying but feels slightly engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is coherent: blackout → sundial code → igniter crystal → partial reillumination → networked sabotage plans. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid (causal scaffolding with textural accumulation of “sparks” and “angles”), and closure lands as a Charged Poise with the fort “poised for ignition.” However, there is little on-page resistance—every step works as intended, so escalation feels procedural rather than pressured. Cost at closure is mostly conceptual (risk of rebellion) rather than concretely dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual sequence where placing each rock escalates toward a climactic reconfiguration of his curse. Cause-and-effect is mostly solid (rocks → energy build → focused visions → understanding), and the final shift in his relationship to foresight and purpose gives a clear before/after. The stakes of failure are somewhat vague (visions of “futures of failure” never get a concrete present-world consequence), softening the sense of cost. Still, the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration of the premise with a lifetime of suffering serving as the implied price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: storm → timer → envelope → poem → response → decision to descend, culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration of his “vigil.” The causal chain holds, with the envelope as a clear inciting intrusion and his reply + descent as closure. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural; pressure builds via motifs rather than sharp plot turns, which fits but keeps escalation soft. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (his solitary map becomes communal), but the cost and narrowing of options feel more inferred than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: waiting → noticing sundial oddity → decoding message → duel → mid-fight reveal → alliance, all within a single coherent scene. Closure is solidly on-page: Lang yields, the rivalry reframes, and the greater-stakes conflict with the Academy is accepted as their new shared path. The main weakness is that the supposed larger threat (Imperial Academy inquisitors) remains mostly abstract and offstage, so the new direction carries more conceptual than felt weight. Still, the structure is tight, temporally clear, and free of major causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clear: sorting books → contact → discovery of seeds → rebuilding → garden → gatherings/uprising, with a clean accumulative move into the “weeks later” shard. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid tilted toward Accumulative/Textural: each act of ordering and planting layers meaning rather than hinging on sharp reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library and garden now function as an engine of resistance, with the coffee tin and final poem charging the end image. Cost is the weakest link—risk is gestured at (warden’s rage, forbidden garden) but no specific sacrifice or loss sharpens the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discover reel → decode hidden map → journey through the arbor → musical encore in the refuge that alters the rules (clock, compasses, tides). Structure holds as a straightforward quest with one transition from station to arbor, and the closure—refuge found, fate reweighted—is legible and on-page. Cost is present (peril, exertion, years of grief) but relatively soft, with the near-sweep by the surge resolving quickly and without a consequential choice. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative lyric overlay, held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: ascent to ridge → planting the seed → dream entry → awakening the Guardian → restoration of memory, with a coherent before/after. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the island’s memory is restored, yet the monsoon/doubt frame preserves cost and incompleteness. However, the central magical solution (seed + dream-interpretation) unfolds with little resistance or complication; no step threatens to fail or meaningfully redirect tactics. The monsoon clock remains more atmospheric than structurally determinative, which slightly softens the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter built around a ritual sequence (arrival → lesson → pruning → compass vision → reconfiguration) with clear causal steps. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a causal skeleton, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s relationship to regret is reweighted on the page with cost in her tears and release. Stakes and transitions are always legible; orientation is firm from the breezy islet opening onward. The main limitation is that the ritual proceeds almost too smoothly, with no real structural surprise or complication once the pattern is established.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality collapses under the weight of metaphorical logic applied literally. The mechanism where butterfly dust applied to a paper printout physically removes "solar wind drama" from digital data is scientifically incoherent for a researcher protagonist. The narrative relies on a "magic feather" solution that resolves the central conflict instantly without logical groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality breaks significantly with the frost-mapping mechanic; the alignment of ledger ink spacing with ground frost patterns is a convenient coincidence that lacks logical grounding. The transition from artist to tactical hunter is unearned, relying on "instincts" rather than a coherent cause-and-effect chain.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where a deep trauma is instantly cured by the application of a tuning fork without visible cost or trade-off. The narrative arc lacks a decisive moment of sacrifice, resulting in a convenient ending that bypasses the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "permanent address" goal with clear cost. However, the pivotal method—"occupying impossible spaces"—emerges abruptly from "desperation" without sufficient causal setup for an undertaker's established skillset.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.7)
    The story violates the short-form scope by summarizing months and years ("Weeks passed," "Years later") instead of dramatizing a single decisive scene. There is no specific inciting incident or climax on the page; the central turn (the declaration) is a low-stakes ceremony where everyone agrees immediately. Causality is replaced by montage, preventing the formation of a legible closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a convenient magic system where a tool immediately solves the central problem without failure or cost. The "past life memory" serves as a convenient setup rather than an integrated narrative engine. Closure is achieved through an instant realization that dissolves the quest's difficulty, lacking a felt price for the change.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a complete causal arc with legible closure and cost (the destruction of the photographs). However, the resolution via "rotating the halo fragment through pseudospherical helices" reads as a convenient technological magic wand.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.7)
    Causality is severely strained by the coincidence of Elara discovering the piano cipher "amid the prizes" only when the bombs fall, despite being imprisoned there for months. The escape resolution depends on unearned preparation (the loosened floorboard and nail) rather than immediate tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a tight "process" arc (gather, forge, test) that maintains clear momentum and causality. The collection of absences provides necessary groundwork for the climax, and the closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where trauma is repurposed. The "mitosis" timer serves as effective pressure, though its link to memory replication is asserted rather than demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The pivot of the story relies entirely on a clumsiness accident—her sleeve catching the pedestal—rather than protagonist agency. This breaks the causal chain; the revelation is luck, not skill. The ending offers a low-cost resolution where she simply accepts a magical upgrade and departs.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence but lacks causal friction; Elias succeeds at every step without setbacks or forced improvisation. Technical logic breaks immersion—feeding a glass furnace with "salvaged cables" is implausible for the chemistry and heat required for clear glass. The closure is a stated decision rather than an earned, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=1.2)
    The narrative structure collapses due to the inclusion of drafting notes ("No—word count overrun," "Actually:"), which breaks causality and prevents a coherent timeline. The ending is a series of conflicting options rather than a resolved closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path that technically reaches a resolution, but the closure is severely disrupted by non-textual generation artifacts in the final paragraphs. The plot lacks a meaningful turn, resolving the central problem through a simple transaction without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure relies on a list-like summary of loops ("Third loop... Fourth loop...") rather than causal progression. The ending is an "explain-everything" resolution where the protagonist explicitly lectures the reader on the prompt's answer ("Thoughts came from the amalgamation..."), dissolving narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative arc depends on a "magic feather" resolution where the lens and tickets instantly solve the central conflict without causal friction. The ending is a soft reset—the problem evaporates because the character looks at a hologram—lacking any decisive change driven by agency or cost. The closure is unearned, relying on a supernatural device to bypass the necessary emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story achieves strong closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the logic of luck is redefined by the protagonist's labor. While the garden's revealed sentience ("feigned withering") leans slightly on fable logic, the causal link between the polishing ritual and the outcome is firmly established.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure collapses in the final third due to the intrusion of editing notes and meta-commentary ("Wait, trim to fit," "No, recalibrate"), which destroys the fictive dream. While the "sideways time" concept is established, the resolution relies on a "magic machine" that instantly converts the skeptic without earned causal struggle. Closure is nonexistent; the story resets itself multiple times, ending on a drafting artifact rather than a narrative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    The mechanism of water damage instantaneously organizing ink into a detailed map with arrows is a convenient magical leap that breaks causal grounding. The climax suffers from melodramatic physics; opening a grate causing the foundation to crack and the building to groan strains credibility, reading as unearned escalation to force an exit.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, moving from feverish haze to a crystallized moment of acceptance via the smudging ritual. Closure is effective, landing on an "Earned Stasis" where the weight of the truth is accepted, though the link between the berry and the specific knowledge of the death feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative causality breaks at the pivotal realization; Jax listens to a portable radio, yet the reveal claims he "punched in" a code to make the call, confusing the prop's established function. The timeline of his interaction with the wheel and the "call" is muddled, creating a logic gap that undermines the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence (find, unfold, travel, arrive) with soft causality; the environment yields magically ("soil parting like obedient pages") rather than through effort. Closure is a change of address without a fundamental shift in stance or a paid price, resulting in a low-stakes "Deepening" that lacks the required cost for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where the resolution (healing) is granted by a convenient object rather than earned through a high-stakes choice. Causality is weak; the emotional shift happens because the plot requires it, not because pressure forced a change.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres, leading to a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration where the silo's tilt becomes a compass. However, the narrative relies heavily on a "diary dump" to deliver the core plot, reducing causal immediacy and turning the middle section into exposition reading.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.9)
    A severe causality break occurs in the central mechanism: baking microfilm in a kitchen oven to shrink it and alter its coordinates is physically impossible and breaks suspension of disbelief. The resolution is symmetric and convenient, with the plan working perfectly to total victory without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, checklist-style progression where the protagonist deploys tools to solve a problem without facing meaningful setbacks. The closure is a restoration of the status quo ("Stillness endures") achieved without a visible price or sacrifice, lacking the required felt cost for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic sequence where the ritual succeeds simply because it is performed, lacking causal friction or unexpected setbacks. Closure offers symmetric satisfaction (she wants to conduct, she conducts) without a "Decisive Change" that exacts a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path (enter, fight, win), but the causality relies on dream logic and buzzwords ("procedural generation") rather than logical progression. The "labyrinth" operates arbitrarily, generating convenient obstacles that are resolved by "defiance" or "phasing," lacking a tight causal chain where specific actions yield specific consequences. Closure lands as a "Decisive Change," but the ease of the victory undercuts the structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "miracle cure" trajectory where the central problem is resolved instantly by the phonograph without complication or sacrifice. The ending provides high closure but fails the requirement for a visible, felt cost, resulting in a tidy but weightless resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path to closure (Refusal of the Call), but the pivotal deduction—that storms force pigeon trajectories to bait recorders—is a logic leap that feels convenient ("Sherlock scan") rather than evidenced. The ending lands a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.9)
    Causality relies on "magical science" (UV light revealing molecular ghosts inside a perfume vial) that breaks suspension of disbelief. The closure is a conceptual platitude ("tears were memory's gift") that feels imposed rather than earned by the scene's action. The narrative logic creates a "because I said so" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the resolution relies on a "third option" that bypasses the established stakes without a clear, felt cost. The protagonist resolves the "impossible choice" by simply choosing integration, which feels like a convenience to satisfy the plot rather than a hard-won causal outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the "hush" is reframed rather than eliminated. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient; the "magic" of the violin solves the antagonistic pressure of the hush with inevitable ease.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene follows a clear, linear causal arc from preparation to transformation and closure. The ending achieves Earned Stasis, where Elias maintains his professional distance at the cost of genuine connection ("affection without entanglement"). The structure efficiently delivers the premise, though the pacing is extremely compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot relies on a massive coincidence: a misaddressed letter arriving at a public library exactly when the addressee is lingering there. The narrative moves linearly from A to B without meaningful obstacles; the mystery is solved instantly by the sender explaining everything in the first conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where potential obstacles dissolve immediately upon engagement; the group forms and succeeds simply because they try. Timeline compression ("For cycles now," "Days blurred") glosses over the pivotal mechanics of relationship-building, reducing the central struggle to a montage. Closure is a unified tableau that feels inevitable rather than earned by specific causal pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a functional inciting incident and climax, but the resolution is mechanically tidy. The solution—using the pendant to borrow time—removes the obstacle without exacting a tangible "felt cost" or complicating the outcome, leaving the closure feeling somewhat low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line (preparation, ritual, result) with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the plot functions mechanically; the ritual succeeds without significant complications or deviations, making the outcome feel somewhat inevitable. The connection between the physical act (dovetailing) and the result (visions) is established but relies on convenient magic-system logic rather than character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on two critical failures of credibility: the extreme coincidence of finding a specific, decades-lost personal item in a random wall exactly when needed, and the physical impossibility of playing magnetic tape with a phonograph needle. These breaks in causality and logic invalidate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Decisive Change (becoming a plant). However, the causality is weak; the leap from finding a pulsing leaf to successfully brewing a metamorphic tea lacks grounding, feeling like a convenience to satisfy the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, moving from the inciting rain to the exchange and final realization (Conceptual Repricing). However, the causality relies on a convenient coincidence—Mira appearing exactly at the moment of discovery—which weakens the sense of inevitability. The closure is functional but feels somewhat unearned due to the rapid, low-friction agreement between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Thorne leaving with the seed) lands with a clear change in status. However, the plot relies on heavy-handed exposition (forces whispering their exact motives) to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a linear "and-then" progression where the protagonist finds a magic object and immediately solves the central problem without setback or cost. The climax is structured as a literal list ("First interval," "Second interval"), which breaks narrative immersion and reduces the resolution to a mechanical checklist rather than a dramatic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply uses a magical tool to bypass every obstacle without complication. While the orientation and sequence are clear, the closure—a symmetric return loop with a stated realization—feels mechanically tidy rather than earned by narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but causality is driven by magical convenience; the connection between star charts, whale paths, and the magic square is asserted rather than earned. The "entangled memories" mechanic resolves the central mystery instantly without a trial-and-error phase or complication. Closure is achieved through a tidy, symmetric distribution of peace to all characters.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect path to a Decisive Change closure. However, the trajectory is frictionless; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or complications, making the "cost" of losing immortality feel like a simple transaction rather than a dramatic price.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the narrative arc is complete, the resolution relies heavily on a deus ex machina; the ink pot conveniently reveals the specific equations needed to bypass the guards and chemically alters the protagonist's mindset to allow it. This circumvents the need for genuine problem-solving or consequences, lowering the narrative cost of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    The fable-like structure holds together with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure where the book releases the town. However, the causality is soft—the mechanism by which binding truth thaws the frost relies entirely on dream logic, which works for the genre but lacks visceral cost beyond the symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.6)
    The accumulative structure is legible, but the climax relies on a convenient coincidence (finding the exact poison label in a random refuse pile) rather than agency or deduction. This "lucky find" undercuts the narrative drive; the resolution is given by the environment, not earned by the protagonist's specific method or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent arc from arrival to a conceptual resolution, fulfilling the closure requirement with a clear "repricing" of the myth. However, the causal logic of the "busting" is obscure; the transition from rational skepticism to a magical ritual (cello summoning voices) blurs the ground rules. The story moves efficiently but feels slightly outline-like due to the lack of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    The resolution relies on summary and convenient competence ("Insiders knew," "intuition foresaw") rather than causal mechanics. The ending dissolves into a montage ("Weeks passed"), diluting the immediate cost of the scene's climax. The "reorganization" happens too easily via off-page coordination, lowering narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain from the climb to the flares and rescue is functional, but the rescue feels convenient, lowering the cost of the crisis. The survival stakes are resolved by external aid (the rover) rather than a decisive, costly move by the protagonist at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality strains credibility significantly when the blind protagonist diagnoses microfractures by feeling "air's subtle shifts as light danced" in water, breaking the story’s physical reality. The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path without reversals, ending in a low-stakes success with no visible cost or sacrifice to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence—the condensation on the window perfectly matching the ancient map coordinates—which acts as a deus ex machina to resolve the central puzzle. While there is a decisive change (departure), it lacks earned causality or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "magic fix" trajectory where the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual without obstacle, and succeeds perfectly. There is no causal pressure, no moment of failure, and no paid cost to earn the resolution, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction ending that lacks narrative drive. The closure is purely additive, lacking the required decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality suffers from extreme convenience; the specific solution (vial) is found sitting on a pedestal within the problem chamber. The ending offers a "complete win" (prize secured + rescue arriving) with no visible trade-off or cost, lacking the friction required for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a legible linear path to closure, successfully wrapping up the "wolf" arc with a resonant reconfiguration of the father's cries. However, the narrative operates on dream logic with little causal friction, and the cost of the ritual—or the danger of the guards—remains theoretical rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story violates the scope default by relying on montage ("days blurred into nights") rather than a continuous scene, diluting the immediate pressure. While the closure (death/reunion) is legible, it feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page causality or active navigation of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on dream logic where metaphorical actions (sewing stone) yield immediate, unearned magical results (dissolving social precedents). The closure is a "magic fix-all" without visible cost or causal linkage; the conflict resolves simply because the protagonist performs a ritual without opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative violates the default scope by presenting a fourteen-day summary rather than a dramatized scene, resulting in a checklist-like progression of events. There is no inciting incident in the dramatic sense, and the closure—a completed repair job—lacks earned resistance or causal density, reading as a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear task execution with clear orientation and a coherent closure unit (sealing the letter). However, the progression lacks causal density or a meaningful turn; the stakes are theoretical ("omnipresent digital gaze") rather than pressing on the page. The closure functions as a moment of readiness (Charged Poise) but carries minimal accrued weight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fix-it path where the protagonist identifies a problem and solves it with a convenient magical action (correcting the chart corrects reality/perception). The mechanics of how the embroidery prevents the coup are vague, and the climax—handing off the parcel—lacks pressure or the possibility of failure. Causality is functional but relies on summary outcomes rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where magic conveniently solves the central conflict without exacting a visible cost. The reunion relies on a "soft reset" of reality via the shard and spirits, bypassing the hard work of actual reconciliation or the permanence of loss. Causality is soft; events happen because the protagonist "evokes" them, not because of earned narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is strained by "false expertise," as decoding smudged notes via "tidal patterns" lacks verisimilitude and breaks the drive lens. The closure offers a "soft reset" where deep trauma is resolved by a single symbolic gesture without visible cost, trade-off, or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with no causal complications, reversals, or meaningful obstacles. Closure fails the rubric’s requirement for cost; the protagonist gains joy and approval without any sacrifice, trade-off, or endurance, leaving the ending unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the climax relies on a magical bypass ("time dilated") where the protagonist's tool simply solves the problem without failure or adaptation. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the antagonist completely flips her worldview with no remaining cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot advances through summary ("orchestrated message patterns") and culminates in a convenient, low-stakes resolution where the "warp" instantly neutralizes the antagonist. Closure fails the "felt cost" requirement; the protagonist achieves total victory without sacrifice or trade-off. The narrative arc lacks causal resistance, resembling a montage of success.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulation-based path: finding an object leads directly to a magical resolution without complication or reversal. The closure (sleep/peace) is achieved through a ritual that feels like a "soft reset," lacking a distinct, felt cost or a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    The linear accumulative structure works well to build tension, with the cracking tube serving as a clear ticking clock. The closure is legible—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library is enlivened at the cost of the instrument. However, the inciting incident is summarized in flashback ("One twilight... she found it"), distancing the reader from the initial narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where the stated risks ("lexical curse," "errant glyph") never materialize to complicate the plot. The closure is a "soft reset" achieved through perfect magic, lacking the visible cost or sacrifice required for a high-band Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure collapses into a broad summary montage ("Days blurred," "Clans arrived") exactly when dramatization is needed, violating the single-scene scope. The plot relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the perfectly preserved, relevant letter) that instantly dissolves the obstacle without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.4)
    The piece fails the 600–800 word scope default, functioning as a biographical synopsis spanning decades rather than a dramatized scene or two-shard sequence. The resolution (reconciliation and death) occurs in rapid summary without a concrete closure unit, and the inciting incident and climax are narrated from a distance rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that lacks causal friction; the protagonist resolves the central puzzle by "intuiting" a code and twisting a chair, which feels unearned. While closure is achieved (reunion), the warned cost ("lose the light") manifests vaguely as the terrace fading, lacking a visceral sense of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.0)
    Causality is weak; events progress via convenient intuition and instant trust rather than logical consequence or pressure. The opening spatial orientation is confusing: entering a "fractured" (implied flooded) dome in a submersible, yet physically touching a console with a glove, creates conflicting physical rules that obscure the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.4)
    The resolution relies entirely on a deus ex machina; the bird arrives at the perfect moment to deliver the specific thematic answer Elara needs. There is no causal link between her efforts and the solution, and the ending acts as a conceptual explanation rather than a dramatic closure with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is broken by two massive implausibilities: the physics-defying precision of the throw and the immediate appearance of a stranger carrying a matching chess piece. The narrative relies on "magical" coincidence to solve the central problem, removing all tension and agency.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on convenience over causality, evidenced by the anchor and its reversal both occurring "spontaneously." The solution (observing gaps in stars) disconnects from the physical problem (a moonstone anchor) without establishing a rule set to bridge them.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with low causal resistance; the protagonist seeks clarity and immediately receives it via a magical vision. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of prior obstacles or felt cost makes the resolution feel unearned. Orientation is adequate, but the plot is largely internal and passive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a causal turn; the resolution (Lena's immediate acceptance of his wisdom) feels unearned and convenient. The "bargain" is backstory rather than a present-moment pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality relies on "magic-wand" logic where arranging shells arbitrarily fixes reality. The closure fails the cost requirement, offering a "fix-everything" resolution without visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, following a clear causal chain from exploration to discovery to realization. The climax (developing film via echoes) is inventive and logically consistent within the story's established magic system. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's purpose shifts from mapping space to mapping history/sin. The pacing holds up well for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear ritual lacking causal turns or genuine obstacles; the protagonist arrives, succeeds immediately, and leaves. The mirrors' resistance is overcome instantly with "grace," removing any sense of risk or cost. The ending is a soft reset (survival for another year) rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear but lacks causal tension; the leap from centuries of war to peace hinges on a convenient star alignment and a brief speech. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned, missing the friction or deepening required to justify the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central causal mechanism—drought cracks forming a map that mimics extinct bird flight paths detectable by satellite—strains plausibility and breaks the otherwise gritty corporate reality. The ending relies on the pathetic fallacy of the storm arriving exactly on cue to "heal or drown" the gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unearned success where the central obstacle (the loom) yields immediately to the protagonist's attributes. While a Decisive Change occurs, the lack of prior resistance or paid price renders the closure flat and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a static scene of reflection where the primary conflict (the argument) is strictly retrospective. While closure is technically present (a decision to change methods), it lacks dramatic causality or pressure within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative structure, with each tower increasing in complexity and response. However, the closure—Elara's acceptance of dissolution—feels pre-ordained by the "method," resulting in a symmetric satisfaction ending that lacks genuine causal tension or unforeseen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear process, but causality is weak; the solution works immediately without trial, error, or adaptation. The closure is a "soft reset" where success is achieved through magical convenience rather than a decisive choice with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" ending where the directive explicitly articulates the plot's logic, reducing the climax to a passive data download. While the story moves causally from entry to exit, the resolution feels like a soft reset that clears obstacles without a felt, concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural structure where every action yields immediate success without setback. While the ending offers a legible state change (becoming the sentinel), the lack of causal obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The "cost" of the oil is symbolic but lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the outcome feels inevitable from the start. The "scheme" encounters no resistance or complication; the magic object works perfectly to resolve the conflict. Closure is achieved through a realization ("Thorne understood") that feels delivered by the mechanism rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the closure offers symmetric satisfaction—he wants the dream and gets it—without a legible cost. The "magic" ritual works perfectly on the first try, resolving the grief too neatly. The ending lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for high-band literary closure, reading closer to wish fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence: Elias finds the bag the exact morning Lila returns. The climax relies on soft magic logic (a ribbon binding a quartz fracture) that resolves the central problem without meaningful difficulty or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where causality is asserted rather than dramatized (e.g., breakthroughs happen simply because she enters the bathroom). The closure—becoming an exhibit—is a valid Conceptual Repricing but feels unearned because the preceding obstacles were resolved by a helpful spirit instruction rather than protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative arc is shattered by non-diegetic drafting notes ("But wait, trim back... [Adjusting flow]"), which destroy the fictive dream. The story progresses through a rapid-fire summary of events rather than dramatized scenes, preventing any genuine causal momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure relies on a repetitive transition scaffold ("Memories altered...") to move between beats, creating a mechanical feel. While the closure (entering the garden) is legible, it feels inevitable and unearned by struggle, as the magic system faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative closure is catastrophically undermined by the meta-fictional break at the end ("No, wait—798 words total"), which shatters the diegetic frame and reduces the story to a prompt-checking exercise. The resolution relies on convenient recall of an obscure note (deus ex machina) rather than causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure with no significant reversals or felt cost at closure. The resolution is achieved through a competency-based ritual that meets no resistance, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable rather than earned. The ending restores the status quo without a "Decisive Change" or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path, but the resolution relies on a convenient "magic fix" (visions provide the exact instruction manual) rather than earned causality. The closure lacks the required cost; the ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist wins completely without trade-off or sacrifice, violating the demand for a decisive change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure (descent, observation, ascent) that supports the Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing ("identity was collective"), which is legible and valid. However, the progression feels mechanical, with the character simply visiting three stations to deliver thematic exposition rather than navigating a causal chain of rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the central problem is solved by a convenient magical intuition ("intuition bloomed within him") rather than struggle or trial. The transition from discovering the blueprint to the finished rocket ("Hours blurred") glosses over the actual labor and difficulty, reducing the earned satisfaction of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on a "Magic Feather" resolution where the jade cicada dissolves the central conflict without cost or sacrifice. The closure is an "Easy Epiphany" that explains the emotional shift rather than earning it through action. The structure is linear and predictable, moving from a stated problem to a magical solution without a meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The gravity inversion provides a natural, urgent structure that anchors the scene's pacing. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's goal, shifting from escape to intervention. The arrival of the noise-weaver feels slightly abrupt as a complication but effectively forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a linear problem-solution structure where a magical tool (catalyst oil) resolves the conflict instantly. There is no Decisive Change or felt cost; the "perfect" resolution leaves the ending feeling unearned and purely additive.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative structure is linear and relies on convenient plotting, such as the ruby flake suddenly possessing a specific counter-frequency to defeat the drones. The climax is rushed and summarized ("each tread testing her soul"), robbing the ending of earned causality or weight.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, following a clear Causal drive from the encroachment of the ring to the decisive severance at the climax. The inciting incident and resolution are distinct and logically linked, though the progression feels somewhat linear and the closure choice is signaled early.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where external instructions yield immediate success via a convenient machine, lacking a "because/therefore" escalation of difficulty. While the closure logically completes the inversion of the pyramid scheme concept, the absence of obstacles or missteps makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a severe causality break where "intuition" and "synaptic doors" magically translate music into the precise location of a hidden panel. The resolution—burning evidence to "expose the rot"—is logically muddled; destroying proof usually protects a legacy from scandal rather than ending it. The narrative moves linearly without meaningful obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative arc is a linear progression of wish fulfillment with zero resistance; Elowen enters, finds the object, performs the ritual, and succeeds. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—he gets exactly what he wanted ("mastery over what might be") without a visible trade-off, sacrifice, or twisted consequence. The lack of obstacles or failure states dissolves all narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative anchors the reader well in time and place, but the inciting incident relies on weak physics; "ghostly fingerprints" in dust from 1867 would likely be obliterated by years of subsequent accumulation. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but it arrives via a convenient discovery rather than a causal chain driven by the protagonist’s decisions against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot hinges on a "puddle map" acting as a *deus ex machina*, resolving the navigational problem without established causal logic or effort. While the narrative arc is complete (inciting incident to resolution), the progression lacks earned turns; the protagonist moves from point A to B without significant obstacles, making the closure feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from entry to confrontation to resolution, with a clear form of closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the causality relies on abstract "dream logic" where musical terms ("negative space") act as magical spells without established ground rules or physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unearned success; the inciting incident leads instantly to the solution without complications or "try-fail" cycles. The closure (saving the arbor) arrives via a magical "fix-it" button (the sylph) rather than through causal effort or sacrifice. There is no felt cost to the resolution, making the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where the protagonist seeks validation for a new philosophy and finds a journal that provides exactly that. The ending lacks a "cost proof," as the resolution comes without sacrifice or genuine risk. The obstacle (vines) is trivial and overcome instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with a "magic fix" resolution that feels unearned. The climax (Thorne's return) is a convenient miracle that dissolves the stakes without a visible cost or complication, violating the requirement for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot is a functional but linear procedural: arrive, track, confront, heal. The resolution (playing "funny" music to heal a soul) feels convenient and lacks causal friction or the risk of failure. Closure is achieved, but the "cost" described ("ache lingered") is abstract and does not alter her future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (redefining mercy), but the causal chain relies on unearned conveniences (equations visibly etched on the strap, the forest "hushing" because she solved a mental problem). The setup (dumped in a forest after torture?) is functional but logically thin.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks resistance; the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics. The closure is an example of "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved with no visible cost or trade-off, resulting in a "win-win" scenario that feels unearned. The "eternal instant" framing suspends causality rather than heightens it.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a convenient, late-introduced ability ("visions triggered by his gift") to deliver the backstory and solution, rather than earning it through investigation. The closure is neat and tidy ("ghosts finally clocked out"), lacking the "felt cost" required for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, check-list structure (receive instruction, execute instruction) with weak causal pressure or complication. The ending relies on a "transcendence wash"—a burst of abstract light and eternity—rather than a structural turn that reconfigures the stakes with tangible consequence. The lack of an orientation penalty helps, but the "because/therefore" chain is fragile due to the protagonist's passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is tight and causal, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing where the destruction of the object revalues it as a tool for provocation. The heist logic and the pivot from theft to shattering are well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path, but the resolution relies on a "magic button" fix (the tether) that lacks mechanical grit or causal cost. The ending—restoring the sun to the entire world via a music box—feels unearned by the relatively minor physical action performed. Closure is happy but lacks the required "felt cost" to land with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a "guided tour" structure where visions conveniently solve all obstacles (e.g., "pull the first") without requiring deductive agency from the protagonist. Causality is soft; Elara succeeds because the narrative says she does, not because of cleverness or sacrifice. The closure brings a change in status but lacks the requisite visible or felt cost to land with impact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a magical convenience (the lantern projecting safe paths and ancestors) to resolve the central problem, bypassing causal ingenuity. The closure lacks a visible cost; Elara retains the slide and escapes easily, rendering the initial isolation toothless. The structure feels like a checklist of interactions rather than a developing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary montage ("Day after gray day," "Across the melting weeks") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope defaults for short fiction. The protagonist encounters no significant obstacles; the window is cleaned and the epiphany reached without resistance or deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is complete and creates a legible loop from the library to the vision and back. The transitions are functional, though the "retrocognitive" shift relies on a convenient magical object ("encrypted diary") to drive the plot. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, though the resolution feels somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "task completion" structure devoid of genuine complications or setbacks. The ending provides a "god-mode" resolution where the protagonist simply wills a new civilization into existence, bypassing the requirement for a decisive change with felt cost. The lack of causal friction makes the revival feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid: discovery leads to method, which leads to the prophecy and decision. Closure is a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing. The "accidental prophecy" functions as a convenient thematic explainer, but the structure holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure where the protagonist immediately applies the correct tool to solve the crisis. While the sequence is logical, the closure lacks a felt or conceptual cost; the "borrowed time" is saved without sacrifice, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causal logic fractures at the pivot: diverting electrical power via a switch to a rope that requires manual pulling is incoherent. The "glue drying" constraint generates passive waiting rather than active pressure, and the resolution provides a tidy victory without the required visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions as a vignette with a clear accumulation of mood, but the causality is soft; the protagonist simply enacts a ritual and feels better without an obstacle. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of resistance makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent with a clear inciting incident and a closure that lands a legbile Resonant Reconfiguration (guardianship). However, the central turning point relies on a convenient information dump delivered via "contextual clues," and the resolution (mending the box with a gaze) lacks causal friction or mechanical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is solid: the external threat (enforcers) necessitates the covert method (garage sales), which yields the clue leading to the climax. The logic of the Shift is consistent within the story's surreal parameters, and the closure—a conceptual reframing of time as grief—follows organically from the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure with legible orientation and closure. However, the cause-and-effect chain is mechanical; the repair process is frictionless ("improvising stanzas," "sap from nearby fronds"), and the resolution feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing months of action ("Days blurred into weeks") instead of dramatizing a specific scene. The ending relies on a post-death summary of future pilgrims, failing to provide a concrete, on-page closure unit with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality falters regarding the footprints: if Elara is a pioneer using illicit data, the presence of "multiple wanderers" and pre-existing tracks undermines her agency and the uniqueness of her discovery. The lock-and-key resolution resolves the mystery mechanically without forcing a hard choice or clarifying the "artificial" versus "physical" nature of the pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (arrive, read, listen, act) with no causal complications or obstacles to force a deviation. The "soft reset" ending—where the garden blooms instantly upon completing the ritual—lacks earned cost, as the solution is provided entirely by external instructions (the birds).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative arc is complete but lacks tension; the riddle is solved instantly, and the journey is summarized rather than dramatized. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (accepting flawed reality over preserved memory), but the lack of prior struggle makes the resolution feel unearned and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on convenient magical logic where a sketchpad and compass resolve a survival crisis instantly without testing the protagonist. The narrative includes a catastrophic meta-intrusion ("Word count pulsed to finality") that shatters the fictional frame and destroys immersion. Causality is weak; the "rift" appears exactly when needed as a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and efficiently structured, with a distinct beginning, middle, and end. However, the resolution comes too easily; the protagonist overcomes the board's resistance without a significant setback, forced trade-off, or deviation from the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ritualistic structure provides a strong linear spine, and the orientation within the gallery is handled well. Closure lands clearly with the "unbinding," though the cost feels more like a relief (losing a burden) than a painful sacrifice, softening the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is complete and concludes with a legible Conceptual Repricing of "home." However, the progression relies on convenient magic (the feather method works on the first try) rather than causal setbacks, making the middle feel linear and low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    Closure relies on dream logic where internal forgiveness arbitrarily thaws an external village without established rules. The causal link between the physical action (picking threads) and the global consequence is purely symbolic, lacking grounded mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, but the resolution arrives with minimal friction; the protagonist faces no active opposition, paying no price for her rebellion. The closure—a conceptual victory over the ritual—feels unearned by the low difficulty of the events.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is mechanically repetitive (touch pockmark, trigger memory, heal) with no variation in pacing or pressure. The resolution is a *Deus Ex Machina* where the statue magically repairs the workshop without the protagonist paying a visible price or making a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure relies on two major causality breaks: a "wrong turn" that conveniently leads to a perfect oasis (lucky coincidence) and a late-breaking genre shift (a holographic crystal) that resolves the plot. Closure is "symmetric satisfaction," granting the protagonist exactly what he desires via a *deus ex machina*.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a "magic feather" resolution where an external object solves the central conflict without cost. The inciting incident (the fight) is backstory, and the climax (her return) is virtually guaranteed by the magic, removing tension. Causality is weak because the reconciliation depends on a supernatural mechanic rather than interpersonal dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on summary montage ("worked through salt-stung nights," "Another midnight") rather than a continuous scene, violating short-story scope defaults and distancing the reader. Spatial logic falters; being "stranded atop" a perch contradicts his ability to freely scavenge driftwood and eel sinew from the shore.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from discovery to surgery to testing, with a satisfying resonant closure. The retrieval of the specific "mad doctor" knowledge via convenient textbooks is a slight contrivance that speeds the plot but feels lucky.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and closure (pinning the flower). However, the plot relies on a supernatural mechanism (touching the flower allows Elias to see the stranger's memories) that is not established prior to the inciting incident. The "Gap one/Gap two" sequence reduces the climax to an analytical checklist rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but relies heavily on coincidence (the chip arriving midsummer during a flood) and "magic logic" to bridge gaps. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing, but the "Wizard of Oz" style realization feels convenient rather than earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear trajectory with legible causality, moving from inciting dissatisfaction to a climactic choice. However, the pivotal moment relies on a convenient mechanism (the shared exhale unlocking the vortex) rather than a derived tactical decision. Closure is achieved through a decisive change, though the cost is somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear success procedural lacking causal friction; the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual without obstacle, and succeeds. The resolution relies on asserted magic and abstract "revaluing" rather than logical consequence, trade-offs, or genuine structural movement.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.5)
    The distinction between dream reality and the physical world collapses confusingly ("splintering timber" vs. "were they whole?"), obscuring the stakes of the climax. The resolution arrives via an unearned epiphany during flight, lacking a decisive causal turn or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=1.5)
    The narrative arc suffers a catastrophic failure at the closure, dissolving into meta-commentary about word counts that shatters the fictional dream. This intrusion of drafting notes invalidates the preceding story logic and prevents any meaningful resolution or resonance. Causality is further weakened by the protagonist's convenient intuition, which solves the central mystery without effort or investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and coherent, but the resolution arrives via a frictionless "magic feather" (the quill) that dissolves the central obstacle without a tangible cost. The ending feels convenient, lacking a structural pivot where the protagonist must pay a price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, utilizing a clear inciting incident and a distinct climax with the "induced currents." Closure is strong and legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration: forgiveness is granted, but the cost (the shattered bottle, the doomed orchard) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unresisted success, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The resolution is a "fix-everything" moment where the protagonist simply enacts a procedure to heal the universe, devoid of necessary sacrifice or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the closure relies on a "soft reset"—withdrawing the key reverses all consequences without a felt price. While the Conceptual Repricing (clocks measure doubt) is present, the restoration of the status quo ("station's purpose restored") with a smile undermines the gravity of the revealed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from testing to epiphany, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. The structure is solid, though the problem serves the solution almost too perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality is broken by "teleporting information"—the graffiti provides specific, convenient directions ("Union Square") without established logic. The resolution (finding the manuscript) is an unearned reward for following coincidence rather than a result of protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the central conflict is solved by a single explanation and immediate acceptance, bypassing the necessary causal struggle to earn the change; the middle section relies on summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear success sequence where the ritual functions perfectly on the first try, lacking obstacles or meaningful deviation. Closure fails the cost requirement; the ending explicitly states there was "no loss," offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The "ink-wars" backstory is disconnected from the present causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot follows a linear path to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where a magical object resolves the central conflict without cost. The heavy reliance on summary for the setup (rumor chains) weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence: quest, travel, arrival, resolution. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," granting the protagonist exactly what he sought without a complicate twist, felt cost, or meaningful reconfiguration of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina—the magic pen—to resolve the central conflict (the anomaly) without a commensurate cost. The ability to simply "edit" away deaths and structural damage creates a soft reset that undermines the causal weight of the inciting mistake. Closure is achieved, but it feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance or sacrifice in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on unearned "magic realism" where sign language inexplicably stops amplified guitars at a festival without established logic. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where everyone is instantly moved to tears, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist. The resolution feels mechanical and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear "fetch quest" (find object A, go to B, find object C) devoid of meaningful resistance or complication. While the causal chain is coherent, the lack of obstacles makes the progression feel mechanical, and the closure—becoming the guardian—is a status change earned by traversal rather than sacrifice or cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "dream logic" where success is granted by the environment without a commensurate price; the escape into the lagoon dissolves all constraints (harness, guards) instantly. Closure fails the cost requirement, as the ending reads as a pure victory ("inhaled freedom") with no visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The race structure is lucid, but the resolution relies on "fantasy physics" not taught early; the "zodiac wheel" lock and "magnetic resonance" solution feel like convenient magic rather than a causal payoff of the container/storm rules. The key is described as "conceptual" but then functions physically in a groove, creating a logic gap.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic where the conflict is resolved by a "teaching moment" that works instantly, bypassing genuine causal pressure. The climax relies on a magical light show that inexplicably transforms the antagonist without resistance or complication. The closure—Umbra's transformation—feels unearned because the mechanism is abstract symbolism rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.3)
    The plot relies on a "magnetic" Deus Ex Machina to solve the central logistical challenge, replacing human agency and coordination with "invisible fields." Closure is a "soft reset" with zero visible cost; the plan executes perfectly without complication, rendering the narrative tensionless.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (departure) is distinct, but the causality relies heavily on the convenient discovery of a magic object. The "Cataclysm" premise sets up constraints that are largely abandoned when the characters simply flee the setting, weakening the resolution's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative structure works well, building pressure through the whittling and turbine noise toward a resonant closure. The ending creates a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new talisman and a shifted internal state ("lightness bloomed"). Orientation and causality are solid, though the backstory exposition slows the opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of purely additive success with no causal friction or cost; the protagonist desires to cross, and the environment immediately yields. Closure is a "happy ending" triumph without the required visible or felt cost to anchor the change. The lifting of the ban prior to the story removes the primary source of potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a clear causal fable structure, but the closure fails to deliver a felt cost. The climax relies on the Phoenix accepting a "bad song" in lieu of the demanded price (sight), which feels like a loophole that evades the prompt's requirement for a hard trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and then" structure dictated by the "artificial pilgrimage" concept, lacking causal surprise. The distinction between the "simulated chambers" and the physical bells is muddled, creating orientation drag. Closure relies on a stated realization rather than a dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on summary montage ("Nights blurred," "One by one") rather than a causal scene with friction, resulting in a friction-free procession of events. Closure is a "happy ever after" resolution that resolves all tension without the required felt cost or trade-off (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where a magical tool immediately solves a complex societal problem without cost. The ending—a "resurgence through communal ledgers"—is an abstract summary that feels unearned by the preceding action. The "reverse engineering" logic operates as technobabble, removing the need for genuine causal struggle or trade-offs. Closure is achieved through a convenient discovery rather than a decisive change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a montage ("Across nights that blurred") to bridge the gap between failure and success, violating the single-scene/continuous-shard expectation for short fiction. While the causal chain is logical, the summary mode dissipates tension during the escalation phase.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure with a clear Decisive Change (metamorphosis), but the pacing suffers from heavy expository summary. The "video comparison" sequence halts momentum and feels disjointed from the mythic tone of the binding ritual, reading like a checklist insertion rather than organic causality. The ending lands, but the mechanics of the resolution are largely asserted rather than earned through tactical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is legible under an Accumulative lens, but the progression feels mechanical (layer by layer). The connection between the lizard's biology and her decision is symbolic rather than causally earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is severely fractured; finding her family's specific letters buried beneath a random surgeon's floor is an unexplained coincidence that breaks the narrative frame. The mechanics of the central action—digging through stone with a glass hourglass—shatter suspension of disbelief, and the telepathic guidance removes all investigative agency.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where magical abilities immediately solve the central mystery. Closure relies on a "soft reset" where finding the box neatly resolves both the ghostly lyrics and Elara's internal grief without a visible cost or hard choice. The "hushed thunder" reacting to plot beats pushes the pathetic fallacy too far, weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure dissolves tension through a montage ("unwritten calendar," "one night—or was it the thousandth?") rather than dramatizing a specific, high-pressure beat. The resolution—waking up with the block magically removed—feels like a convenient reset rather than a consequence of an earned, specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of successes without causality or setbacks; the protagonist finds the object, understands it immediately, and succeeds in his task. While there is a shift in state (guard to tender), the closure lacks a "felt cost" or decisive change, as the transition is frictionless and the "dreamless" cost is abstract. The Drive Lens is Accumulative, but the lack of resistance flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience, notably the "translocation" during sleep that bypasses travel and the discovery of a gear-socket behind his ear he "never knew existed." This biological Deus Ex Machina resolves the central mystery without setup or ingenuity. The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; success is handed to the protagonist by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear progression of symbolic events with low causality; the protagonist simply walks until she arrives, without facing genuine obstacles or paying a visible cost. The closure—stamping water to gain courage—acts as a "soft reset," granting the goal through symbolic enactment rather than earned consequence. The "leash" metaphor is treated inconsistently, shifting between physical and abstract without logical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Causality is weakened by convenience; the protagonist's "nerve surge" hypersensitivity leading him to a specific loose bolt years after the event strains credibility. The immediate access to a comprehensive neural archive to explain the backstory removes the need for active investigation or interrogation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Months blurred") and remote magical causality rather than dramatized scene pressure. The closure fails the cost requirement; the victory is total and "without blood," lacking any felt or conceptual price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the mechanism of discovery—tapping rhythms to input data and unlock a hologram—is a "magic verb" solution that lacks logical grounding. The "delayed revelation" arrives as a sudden epiphany generated by the computer rather than a deduction earned by the protagonist's agency. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (loss reframed as metamorphosis), but the path there feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear progression of convenience with no Causal drive; Elara arrives, finds a magical solution immediately, and resolves the conflict. The closure is a "fix-it" ending where an unearned discovery (stone circle) solves the global stake (rebellion) without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience: plants guide her to the kite, plants decode the script, and she coincidentally has the required embryo from a decade ago. This chain of fortunate events removes obstruction and cost, leaving a linear path to success without genuine reversals. The closure is a simple success state with no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The inciting incident relies on a heavy coincidence (finding the photo on the exact anniversary), and the resolution feels rushed. The shift from the internal freeze to the external mentorship lacks a dramatized middle beat where the cost of recovery is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina; the protagonist serendipitously finds a magical loom that fixes his problems without prior setup or established world logic. The transition from a lighthouse library to a high-fantasy weaving chamber lacks causal grounding. Closure is achieved through a magical tool rather than character agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a felt cost at closure; the protagonist gains answers through convenient explanation rather than struggle. The central conflict—the raid—is a flashback, leaving the present-tense timeline low-stakes and devoid of urgency. The ending resolves the mystery with a lecture rather than a dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal arc is functional, moving from the glitch to the decision to the broadcast, ending in a valid state of Charged Poise. However, the pacing is breathless, compressing a complex revolution into a "suspended blink" that strains credibility. The "dangerous liaison letter" functions as a convenient plot device available exactly when needed, smoothing over potential obstacles too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative arc is linear but resolves via a deus ex machina (plants releasing calming pollen) that removes the need for a hard choice. The "magic" solution dissolves the threat without requiring a sacrifice or genuine tactical ingenuity from the protagonist. Closure is tidy and lacks the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure that lacks a distinct turning point or complication; the chaos occurs, and he simply applies the known solution. The ending provides legible resolution (he catches the echo) but fails the closure requirement of a "visible or felt cost," reading as a pure victory without trade-off. The inciting incident (stars moving) and climax (voicing silence) feel mechanically sequenced rather than causally driven by character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution hinges on a significant causality break: the antagonist voluntarily provides the ledger that disproves his own lie. The "proof by contradiction" is less a logical deduction and more a result of the opponent's inexplicable incompetence, undermining the sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is excellent, with a clear resonant reconfiguration and paid cost (the tattoo). However, the causal chain suffers a significant break: establishing that he left his tools behind, only to have a "temporal warp" magically fetch them right when needed, is a convenient deus ex machina that undermines the logistical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a linear "magic feather" resolution where the tile and art instantly fix deep-seated interpersonal grudges without earning the change. The causality is weak, depending on the convenient magical properties of the setting rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution hinges on a "magic wand" mechanic (the renaming) that solves the central conflict instantly without prior setup or failure. The ending lacks a visible cost, offering a convenient fix that bypasses the need for genuine tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.8)
    The ending constitutes a "Soft Reset" anti-pattern; the central conflict (a shattered career and scandal) is erased by magic ("timelines mended") rather than confronted. The resolution lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, rendering the narrative arc circular and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality relies on loose associations (fractals mimic brain waves) rather than narrative logic, making the investigation feel arbitrary. The closure is a &quot;happily ever after&quot; summary that dissolves all tension without cost or sacrifice, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    Causality breaks when a sensory tool inexplicably becomes a levitation device; the narrative tension dissolves into a summary of years rather than landing a dramatized closure scene with cost. The ending reads as a biography rather than a story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that barely holds together—matching button glyphs to sonic echoes to "unscramble" a prophecy is a tenuous causal link that lacks grounding. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist faces no setbacks, turning the master hourglass to fix the world without any sacrifice or consequence, resulting in a low-stakes, magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, following a clear Causal lens from arrival to the handover and departure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts his role as the catalyst—lands effectively with a legible cost. However, the mechanism of "snow codes" accumulating in crevices feels slightly contrived, and the pacing is slowed by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative traces a legible accumulative arc where the unpicking of the tapestry mirrors the internal realization, satisfying the closure requirement via Conceptual Repricing. However, the structure is static; the inciting incident is merely the weather, and the resolution coincides conveniently with the rain stopping, lacking causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulation-based structure ("and then") without causal pressure or obstacles. The resolution is handed to the protagonist via magical tools (the glass, the thrum) rather than earned through agency or ingenuity. The closure feels unearned because the outcome was inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but causality is weak; Mira's decision to enter a boat with a stranger at night is driven by authorial convenience rather than character logic. The resolution is a "soft reset" where deep trauma is resolved by a single conversation, lacking visible cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a checklist structure where the protagonist encounters an object, uses it, and succeeds immediately, lacking Causal pressure or meaningful obstacles. Closure is a "level-up" moment (gaining wings) with no on-page cost or sacrifice, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change with a visible price. The repetition of the "hum" refrain acts as a mechanical bridge rather than organic plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.1)
    The plot hinges on extreme coincidence—Theo appearing with a matching object at the exact moment Elara places hers. The causal link (anonymous letters leading him there) is vague and lacks narrative logic ("secret channels").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent, moving from the signal's detection to the confrontation and resolution. The closure lands as Earned Stasis (vigilance), but the "push-button" nature of the resolution—blasting the counter-wave to instantly dissolve the conflict—feels structurally convenient and lowers the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is legible, but the resolution relies on a convenient "flash of insight" regarding the compass's magical function at the climax. The logic of the compass anchoring "mutinous spaces" functions within the fantasy frame but feels like a video-game mechanic introduced solely to solve the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative suffers a catastrophic causality break when the protagonist solves a cold case via a psychic vision triggered by blood on a ribbon. This "Deus Ex Sanguis" bypasses investigation, deduction, and conflict, rendering the "methodical" setup irrelevant. The resolution relies on a confession provoked by a drawing, which feels unearned and convenient rather than the result of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot hinges on extreme convenience: the crate appears exactly when needed, and a copper coffin nail inexplicably fits a "map-case lock" on a weather station console to reveal a digital overlay. The resolution lacks earned causality; Hale’s immediate confession removes the necessity of a climax, rendering the victory hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence: fluttering plastic wrap forming a legible map to a secret trail is a contrivance that dissolves the central mystery without earned effort. The narrative feels stitched together to accommodate prompt phrases, resulting in weak causal links between the vanishing, the glass plate, and the scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on broad synopsis covering years of time, violating the short-story scope and preventing dramatized engagement. The resolution—thugs deterred merely by lit hoops—lacks causal sufficiency and tactical weight, reading as a symbolic convenience rather than an earned outcome. The transition from rise to ruin is told, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a "magic bullet" trajectory where the lucid dream solves the central problem instantly without trial, error, or setback. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—resolving the mystery and the emotional fatigue simultaneously—without a legible cost or sacrifice. The causal chain is convenient, relying on an asserted connection between stars and glyphs that "unveils itself" rather than being earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a significant convenience to resolve the central physical threat: Thorne finds the specific relic he needs ("He'd found it, as always") immediately upon looking. This coincidence undercuts the causal tension of the vortex, acting as a Deus Ex Machina that simplifies the middle build. While the closure is legible, the path to it lacks sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear success procedural structure: problem, action, immediate solution. While closure is achieved, the lack of resistance, complication, or necessary adaptation of tactics makes the victory feel inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot hinges on a convenient coincidence: Elara seeks to barter destinies and immediately finds the specific required tool (the burned tarot card) waiting in the orchard. Closure is achieved through a procedural ritual that succeeds too easily, with the "price yet unpaid" relegated to vague atmospheric threats rather than a concrete, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the inciting incident—finding the exact matching speaker cloth from his own band's final gig in a random quarry box—relies on a massive, convenient coincidence that undermines the Causal lens. The closure is tidy and unearned, resolving complex grief with a sudden business plan for a memorial without visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution track, but the resolution relies on a "soft reset": the seed sprouts and stabilizes the tree overnight without complication. The logic of the magic system (writing analogies fixes physics) is whimsical but lacks causal rigor or cost. The arrival of pilgrims provides a symmetric satisfaction rather than a tested closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear diagnosis-cure structure that resolves the central tension without significant complication or reversal. The ending relies on a "soft reset" anti-pattern where the smelting ritual fixes the character's internal flaw externally, bypassing the need for a hard-won personal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a "destined" coincidence where a found pearl creates a magical effect with a tech node, breaking the established bunker-inspection reality. This Deus ex machina resolves the conflict without a logical causal chain or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=2.8)
    Closure relies on a massive causal break: the "bathroom graffiti wisdom" inexplicably details Elias’s specific accident (bridge collapse, date, mapping sites) to offer him absolution. This functions as a Deus Ex Machina—a magical external force resolving the internal conflict without the protagonist paying a price or making a difficult decision. The narrative loop is linear and lacks resistance; he seeks forgiveness and finds it written on a wall.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence where the environment solves the central puzzle for the protagonist ("The library offered a method") without requiring agency or ingenuity. Closure is a "mission accomplished" moment with no visible cost, trade-off, or resonant reconfiguration of the character's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.4)
    Causality is undermined by a *deus ex machina*: the ivy providing the specific instruction and magical amplification needed to solve the dilemma just in time. The closure—a hybrid "Empress-Composer" role—feels like a soft reset where the stakes evaporate rather than forcing a trade-off. The real-time reaction of the coffee stains to the music reads more like a video game mechanic than literary cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical success that lowers the sense of risk. The closure—total renewal—lacks a significant felt cost or trade-off to weight the victory, resulting in a "win-win" ending that feels unearned given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot hinges on a coincidental discovery (the hairpin) and a convenient vision that solves the central problem without protagonist agency. Closure is achieved through a magical "fix-it" moment rather than a decision with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B path, but the mechanism of change is essentially a "soft reset" where a prop dissolves the central conflict without cost. The ending provides closure, but it relies on a "magic feather" device (the cloak/chimes) to bypass the necessary friction of the inciting incident. Causality is driven by the prompt's checklist rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is tight and relentless; the "delayed revelation" mechanism is dramatized through the physics of the water, forcing the protagonist to deduce the truth rather than being told. The closure (stepping into the water) is a Decisive Change that validates the "vanish to appear" premise with high felt cost. Orientation is anchored immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure collapses into broad summary ("Years passed," "Decades layered"), violating the single-scene scope without establishing a functional mosaic pattern. The resolution relies on a convenient coincidence—the arrival of the flock—rather than a causal outcome of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the central obstacle (bindings) is resolved with inexplicable ease; if Artificers designed them to limit humans, the fact that Thorne can simply unstrap them creates a logic gap that lowers stakes. The closure is a "net win" without the required felt or conceptual cost, reducing the ending to a simple acquisition of power.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence: the tide receding "further than memory" exactly when needed is a Deus ex machina. The resolution is mechanical—a magic key simply unlocks the wife's return—lacking causal setup or a sense of earned consequence. Closure is a "magic fix" that bypasses the permanence of loss without narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a mechanical linear path (cast lots -> decode -> succeed) without deepening complications or reversals. The closure relies on a "magic button" resolution (igniting the beacon) where the universe expands simply because the protagonist completed the procedural tasks. There is no felt cost or sacrifice required to achieve this massive outcome, making the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story follows a linear accumulation (naming three monsters) without unexpected complications or meaningful setbacks. The closure functions as a "Soft Reset," where the protagonist’s grief is completely conquered by the ritual without a lasting, visible cost or jagged edge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative establishes a clear causal chain from the inciting incident (the last fish) to the specific task and its resolution. The logic of the magic system—syncing repairs to dripping rates—is established early and pays off at closure. The story meets the orientation and closure requirements effectively, though the resolution comes without a significant twist.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central plot mechanism—a trail of paper photographs surviving intact after years of submersion in a reservoir—shatters suspension of disbelief and causality. The resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where a symbolic burning instantly resolves deep-seated trauma and "reckoning" without complicating the narrative or exacting a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path with no meaningful deviation or cost; the ritual simply succeeds. The climax relies on a deus ex machina (starlings) to resolve the internal conflict, resulting in a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where all threads tie up without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The plot follows a clear causal line—anomaly, intervention, success—but the central mechanism (remotely instructing a jumper to re-thread a buckle in freefall) strains credibility. The narrative structure feels rigid, ticking off required beats mechanically rather than letting them evolve from the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a functional causal chain, but the resolution relies on "ancient dojo lore" introduced late to solve the central problem. The ending reads as a "soft reset" where a ritual conveniently fixes complex psychological damage without sufficient cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative relies on a severe breakdown of causality and logic (the "Deus Ex Machina" flash drive found in the mud). The deduction chain—from smelling a seed to deducing "UV-mimicking moonlight" to finding buried legal documents at his current random location—is incoherent. Closure is unearned, relying on a "rogue ally" to magically resolve the conflict without the protagonist paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path from the inciting action to a resonant closure where the goal is achieved and the hourglass constraint forces a stop. The cause-and-effect logic holds within the surreal premise, though the pacing is somewhat compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on "soft magic" logic where a change in attitude ("welcoming" uncertainty) conveniently generates a portal, bypassing Causal necessity for a thematic solution. The "pact" with uncertainty is explained to the reader rather than emerging organically from the pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain through the three approximations to a decisive resolution. However, the pivotal realization relies on a sudden epiphany ("when the penny dropped") rather than a pressure-forced tactical evolution, and the climax resolves the struggle somewhat conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal lens, but the climax hinges on a tenuous link between radio tuning and physical structural integrity. Stabilizing swaying suspension bridges by realigning frequencies feels like convenient magic rather than a justified consequence of the established system, weakening the closure's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    The resolution is a classic Deus Ex Machina where technology acts as magic ("tuning the radio... to the patterns' resonance") to fix a metaphysical problem without logic or cost. The "merge" is consequence-free, and the closure is unearned, relying on a convenient prop found at the right moment. The stakes of "vanishing" are resolved too easily to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Solid causal structure; the weaving action directly drives the escalation (memory corruption) and the climax (eruption). Closure is definitive and lands with a legible cost (the loss of comforting illusions for gritty truth), satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration standard.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is linear and the closure relies on a stated conceptual cost ("contracting the soul") rather than a demonstrated price paid on the page. The flow of the ending is disrupted by non-diegetic meta-text ("No, wait—trim to fit"), though the final image of departure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot hinges on an immense, unearned coincidence: finding the hearing aid exactly when the daughter attempts suicide 30 years later. The resolution is a deus ex machina where the ghost resolves the central conflict, leaving the protagonist with no difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    The introduction of a "weathered leather" tome that grants quantum phasing abilities is a jarring genre break in a technological setting, functioning as a deus ex machina. This magic solution dissolves the established physical stakes (tides, walls), rendering the spelunking premise irrelevant at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is broken by the central mechanic—fixing digital code by pouring physical ink—which lacks logical grounding even in a sci-fi context. A significant editing error ("static cleared... after the radio static cleared") disrupts the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Years blurred," "Thorne watched") instead of a grounded scene, violating the immediate dramatization required for literary publication. The resolution—where the curse simply "bends to purpose"—is a causality break that dissolves the central obstacle without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path (find object, use object, resolve) with no complications or reversals. The "cosmic joke" logic functions as a Deus Ex Machina, resolving the central conflict via magic rather than character agency. The causal link between finding the phone and the sudden metamorphosis is tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a valid closure unit with felt cost; the resolution is a "magic wand" moment where music instantly fixes the mechanical blight. The antagonists arrive "too late" by convenience, and the protagonist pays no price for her total victory. Causality is weak, relying on the metaphorical power of music to physically soften soil and uproot iron.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central mechanic—deriving physical coordinates from "linking absences" in empty mail slots—lacks causal grounding, reading as poetic convenience rather than logic. The closure relies on the coincidence of a letter arriving at the perfect moment, rather than a decisive action driven by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure offers a clear change in state (silence to song), but the progression relies on "magical fix" causality where obstacles yield effortlessly. The "wrong turn" inciting incident is a convenient coincidence that lowers the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure relies on a convenient external interruption (a patron's cough) to break the trance, bypassing a decisive, costly protagonist choice. The narrative drive is ritualistic, lacking a tight causal chain of resistance and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear inciting incident and resolution that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to her loss. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands successfully, though the magical causality of the solution is somewhat convenient and lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear linear structure with a distinct closure unit (the locksmith's decision to leave). However, causality is driven by dream-logic and abstract magic ("flame drawn from starfire") rather than grounded rules. The orientation is vague ("shadowed nexus"), leaving the physical reality of the scene unclear, and the resolution relies on a convenient external instruction (the star's hint) rather than proactive problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a symmetric satisfaction ending where the protagonist gains exactly what he seeks without a felt price. The resolution relies on a magical invocation that simply works, bypassing the need for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The &quot;holographic&quot; restoration resolves the conflict too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc under the Causal lens: diagnosis, complication (shadow), and resolution. The "shadow caught in glass" provides a functional midpoint escalation. However, the resolution—drawing a sigil based on tea leaves—feels procedurally convenient and lacks a "felt cost" or significant obstacle, resulting in a low-friction closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where the protagonist fixes a deep metaphysical rot by simply "pruning the air" with no established cost or logic. The ending is a summary of global repair ("world blooming once more") rather than a dramatic scene, violating the requirement for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear path from the shade's appearance to the final restoration, satisfying the Accumulative drive lens. Closure is distinct (the sanctuary quiets, the fisherman is grounded), though the progression lacks a complication that forces Lirien to alter his approach mid-stream.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear success chain: finding the tear, syncing the video, and opening the chapel all occur without resistance. While the causality is clear, the lack of obstacles or complications results in a flat arc. Closure is tidy but lacks a felt cost, as the solution is reached too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on a confusing anachronism—Earhart's plane inside a snow globe on a ship that sank decades before the flight—that is treated as "physics" rather than magic, breaking causal logic. The narrative arc is static; the protagonist arrives, observes an object, has an epiphany, and leaves without a decisive change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a significant convenience: Elowen "rummages" and immediately finds the specific tool (flower press bolt plate) required to solve the central problem. The resolution is linear and lacks causal struggle, as the protagonist faces no setbacks or forced turns before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The elevator ascent provides a solid, functional frame for the pacing, utilizing the floor markers effectively. However, the narrative relies entirely on a passive "reading the diary" device to deliver the plot, resulting in an info-dump structure. The momentum is catastrophically interrupted by a meta-commentary artifact near the climax ("Wait, too many..."), which shatters the narrative timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.0)
    Physics amnesia breaks the narrative's causal logic; the survival of a human in the stratosphere without life support undermines the story's grounded premise. The resolution relies on a convenient visual epiphany and the implausible mechanics of dropping a paper boat from the edge of space, lacking earned narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    The closure is excellent, achieving a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the art survives invisibly. However, the inciting incident relies on a high-convenience trope—finding the exact "slim volume" with the necessary coin method by chance in a library she entered only for "inspiration."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on convenience, with the hopscotch board functioning as a "magic button" that instantly resolves the conflict. The narrative progresses linearly without setbacks, leading to a closure that lacks necessary sacrifice or conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience and "destiny" to solve problems (prophecies found "as if by design," gears fitting "as if predestined"), which robs the story of causal agency. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist succeeds completely without cost or complication. The plot advances linearly without a meaningful turning point or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis or montage rather than a scene, spanning "seasons" and "days" in rapid summary. The resolution is a "magic feather" ending where following instructions yields a total cure without complication or cost. There is no causal deepening; the ghost provides the solution, and the characters simply execute it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing the "pane of hush" to establish a causal logic for the climax. The closure is distinct and earned—the sacrifice of the companion object yields a tangible result (clock reversal)—satisfying the requirements of a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is solid, moving efficiently from the inciting incident to a validated closure where the travelers are saved and Elias accepts his stasis. The retrieval of the blueprint feels slightly convenient—located in a hollow tree right when needed—but the "nut" mechanic provides a strong, logical solution to the established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies on an unearned "magical insight" structure where staring at a river solves a complex chemical problem instantly. The ending dissolves into summary ("Months later... restored clarity"), bypassing the necessary struggle of application and testing. There is no felt cost at the closure; the solution is total and frictionless, lacking the required decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building pressure through the ritualistic carving of the slate until it forces a decisive closure. The ending functions as a Conceptual Repricing, transforming the protagonist from a vendor of blankness to the origin of story itself. Orientation and causality remain stable throughout the surreal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.7)
    The transition from spotting ripples to unearthing a buried pavilion via "hours blurred" of shoveling strains plausibility and pacing; sand physics (refilling holes) are ignored. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the magic subsumption fixes the emotional conflict without a price, resulting in symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.5)
    Causality is broken by the physical impossibility of constructing a 200-yard suspension bridge overnight with rope and planks, followed by an unearned utopian resolution where decades of ethnic strife vanish instantly upon hearing a song. The ending is a &quot;magic fix&quot; with no visible cost or sacrifice. The timeline leaps over the actual struggle to reach a tidy, frictionless conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where the protagonist succeeds immediately at every attempt. Causality is replaced by "dream logic" and technobabble, leading to a resolution that feels like an unearned superpower acquisition rather than a meaningful narrative conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear "mission accomplished" trajectory with no meaningful complications or causality beyond the schedule of the gravity inversion. Closure is purely additive (she gains the knowledge) with no visible cost or trade-off; the ending feels like a completed checklist rather than a narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear process (find, prep, play) without causal tension or unexpected turns. The "method" is delivered via a static exposition block ("This was his method...") rather than through active discovery, and the resolution offers symmetric satisfaction without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands, but the causality relies on dream logic and ritualistic convenience rather than pressure-tested decisions. The resolution feels somewhat automatic once the ritual begins, lacking a pivot point where failure was a genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is functional and linear (problem-solution), but the stakes are low and the resolution—finding the "magic frequency" of 432 Hz—feels convenient and lacking in cost. While the scene has a clear beginning and end, the closure (opening the diary) is a simple success state that does not reconfigure the character's worldview or demand a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates the 600–800 word scope default (single scene) by summarizing weeks of growth in a montage. This structural choice flattens the narrative arc, reducing the inciting incident and climax to generalized descriptions rather than immediate, time-bound events.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a "memory flood" exposition dump upon touching the artifact, which is a convenient shortcut for causality. The closure lacks the required felt cost; the protagonist effectively loots a planetary node to solve her problem instantly, creating a symmetric satisfaction ending that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that lacks a distinct turning point or complication. The closure—filing a report and sewing on a patch—feels performative and lacks a "felt cost" or "decisive change" required for higher bands. The mystery solves itself through observation without any setback or error to drive the plot forward.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal tension; the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without setbacks or meaningful complications. Orientation is clear, and the Accumulative lens holds, but the closure ("mission fulfilled") feels inevitable rather than earned by narrative pressure. The structure resembles a vignette or scene description more than a causal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.9)
    The structure is linear and coherent, establishing a clear goal and achieving it. However, the resolution feels mechanical; the "transformation" is granted by a magical vision rather than a hard choice or paid cost. The magic flute functions as a plot device that resolves the internal conflict too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a clear causal track, but the central mechanism—printing ambiguity to solve a cosmic blight—relies on opaque "magical logic" that distances the reader. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing ("stars within"), but the shift from external threat to internal epiphany feels slightly disconnected, solving a physical problem with a metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension vignette structure where success is guaranteed by a magical object rather than character agency. The "time warp" mechanic functions as a convenience to bypass meaningful interaction, and the closure lacks a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "look and see" structure with minimal causal friction; the protagonist arrives, observes, and succeeds without setback. The climax relies on a supernatural deus ex machina (words appearing in frost) that resolves the central question by fiat rather than protagonist agency. Closure is tidy but unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a convenient inciting incident (finding the box) and resolves the central conflict through expository magic ("legends spoke of such edges") rather than earned causality. While the closure lands with a clear cost (death), the path there is paved with coincidence and magical shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on extensive summary ("Nights blurred," "Hours stretched") rather than a concrete scene, distancing the reader from the action. The resolution is achieved through a magical tool that works exactly as promised, bypassing causal struggle or error. The closure lacks a felt cost; the "barter" is abstract and paid without hesitation or visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on rapid summary and dream-logic to traverse universes, bypassing the causal friction required for a scene. While closure is technically present (the shard fuses), the "redirect" mechanism functions as a magic wand that resolves complications without tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=1.5)
    The narrative structure collapses completely in the final third, dissolving into drafting notes and error messages ("No—that exceeded..."). This failure prevents any functional closure, leaving the inciting incident and rising action without a resolved ending.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving clearly from routine to a Decisive Change (summoning shadows) with functional closure. However, the progression is strictly linear; Elias sees the vision and executes it without external obstacles or meaningful complications to test his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a convenient epiphany where light hitting a prop inexplicably reveals the donor's detailed biography and cause of death ("illuminated her truth"). This breaks causal logic and robs the protagonist of agency in solving the mystery. The ending explains everything mechanically rather than earning the resolution through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative flows smoothly as a fable, but the resolution relies heavily on coincidence—the specific dream map used for the final piece just happens to reveal the thematic truth. The causality is soft (dream logic), which fits the tone, but the lack of structural resistance makes the ending feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "try harder" progression where the protagonist faces resistance, exerts more effort, and achieves total victory (symmetric satisfaction). There is no "Decisive Change" with cost; the ending resolves all problems (tree, night, memory, community) without a structural price or foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure depends on a soft-magic realization to resolve the central conflict rather than causal action. The "paradox" concept functions as a deus ex machina that dissolves obstacles instantly, and the logic of using another's invitation to gain entry is glossed over.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scene opens with a heavy block of reflection that explains the premise before the action begins, slowing early momentum. Closure lands on a soft reset ("I forgive you") that resolves the central tension without a visible cost or a decisive change in tactics. The narrative arc moves linearly to the required ending without generating causal drag or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story follows a linear procedural path—problem, measurement, solution—without a decisive turn or a felt cost at closure. The resolution (etching an equation to raise the library) relies on a "magical engineering" fix that lowers narrative tension. The ending provides a "happy" restoration of order but lacks the required conceptual or emotional price to make the closure resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The causal logic is sound, but the middle section relies on explicit scaffolding ("False start one," "False start two") which summarizes the struggle rather than dramatizing it. Closure works well with the wax cylinder payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative closure ("She tasted eternity") is fundamentally undermined by the meta-commentary and generation artifacts in the final paragraphs ("But wait, trim to fit... [Word count calibrated.]"). This rupture destroys the narrative illusion and prevents any resonant reconfiguration from landing. The plot follows a linear path but relies on an "explain-everything" moment to resolve the central query.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality breaks significantly at the climax: a scavenged "random" slab of mica somehow perfectly matches the grooves of a hidden compartment carved years ago, creating a puzzle solution that relies on impossible coincidence. The closure offers a "happy ending" reset (creativity uncorked) without any visible or felt cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The linear quest structure leads to a clear closure moment (Conceptual Repricing), though the "treasure map" explicitly labeling a metaphorical vault relies on convenient fable logic. The causal chain from the postal plate to the recording vault is imaginative and holds together within the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path of assembly and success without meaningful causal complications or reversals; the "climax" is a montage of functioning mechanics rather than a moment of high-stakes decision. While the inciting incident (iceberg falls) is clear, the resolution lacks a decisive change or earned cost, ending in a static affirmation of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line to a decisive closure (burning the box), but the materialization of digital holograms into physical organic vines is a shaky logic leap. Additionally, the nanite swarms used to solve the climax appear abruptly without prior setup, functioning as a convenient solution to the physical scale of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot relies on a convenient puzzle-logic where stories perfectly align to form a code, leading to a tidy "fix-it" ending where decades of feuds dissolve instantly upon reading letters. The resolution lacks earned causality or sacrifice, and the "outside world" intrusion is ignored rather than integrated into the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality breaks significantly at the climax where "interpretive dance" functions as a decryption key for an AI, a move that operates on dream logic rather than established narrative rules. The discovery of frozen colleagues in a secondary chamber is a convenient, unearned expansion of scope that resolves too easily. The closure is a standard "mission accomplished" without a legible cost or decisive change in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.7)
    Causality relies on unearned conveniences, specifically the coffee grounds providing a literal map to the heart. Spatial continuity breaks significantly: the whale beaches on "jagged rocks," but Elias digs for the heart in "tidal sands." The resolution is a tidy "fix-it" ending that lacks conceptual or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path: intent, ritual, success. There is no inciting incident that disrupts the status quo on the page, nor a reversal that threatens the outcome; the prophecy offers no active resistance. Closure is achieved through simple completion of a task rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary to bridge the inciting incident and climax, compressing the "weekly tea sessions" into exposition. While the closure is legible (a shared language), the lack of a fully dramatized "middle" with rising action weakens the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from ritual preparation to the archiving of the memory, and the closure lands with a legible conceptual shift. However, the obstacles are primarily internal descriptions of sensation, and the mechanism of success feels somewhat automatic once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative arc is functional and complete, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the causality relies on undefined magical thinking—writing on a floor physically unmaking political edicts in distant provinces—which weakens the sense of reality. The "unlinking" resolves the plot conveniently without generating narrative friction or unexpected consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on convenience; the "progressive disclosure" tactic is narrated rather than dramatized, and the climax resolves via *deus ex machina* (echoes binding the merchant) rather than causal agency. The spatial layout of the nexus is vague, reducing the grounding of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear investigation, but the resolution relies on a low-cost magic system where the protagonist simply peers into the globe and commands the truth. The closure—a "fix-it" ending where the globe reforms and ghosts find peace—lacks a decisive change earned by the protagonist's struggle. The ease with which the mystery is solved deflates the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative functions as a low-stakes vignette rather than a story with causal drive. The inciting incident (spotting a net) and climax (mending it) lack resistance or cost; the protagonist simply decides to act and succeeds. Closure is achieved through thematic assertion and a summary of the moral, rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story achieves a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist chooses the "comfortable lie." However, the investigation relies heavily on convenience—specifically the video-game-like discovery of shredded letters that perfectly explain the backstory and a "loose floorboard" found simply by looking down. These coincidences lower the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Alone for years," "Days blurred into weeks") rather than scene-based causality, violating the scope for a short story. The structure resembles a synopsis, preventing genuine pressure from accumulating in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural arc: find, fix, sell. There is no significant cost or resistance; the "sour" melody is cured instantly with magic drops, and the sale is immediately successful. Closure offers a tidy, purely positive resolution without the required felt cost or reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structure is strictly linear and lacks a meaningful "try-fail" cycle; the protagonist simply executes a plan that works perfectly on the first try. The closure is a "button" ending where the problem dissolves into "peaceful mist" without extracting a visible price or forcing a trade-off. Causality is present but low-stakes, as the solution relies on the convenient, immediate functionality of the artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: plan, approach, execute, succeed. There is no meaningful deviation, complication, or cost during the mission; the Regime provides no active opposition. Closure is a Decisive Change, but it feels unearned due to the lack of friction or sacrifice in the inciting action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative abandons its inciting incident (the worker's death) to pursue a sudden internal resolution via a magical artifact. The resolution relies on the convenient discovery of the lantern (coincidence) to solve the protagonist's problem, rather than her own agency building pressure before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on coincidence; the climax is resolved by a beam of light (a literal deus ex machina) rather than the protagonist's agency or a difficult choice. The repetition of the phrase "calm before realization" underscores a lack of organic pacing, and the closure is a "vow" rather than a demonstrated change in behavior or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece fails the scope default (one scene or two shards), offering a broad summary of an era ("from dawn's evolution" to "evolution's crescendo") that dissipates all tension. There is no specific scenic anchor where a decisive change occurs; instead, success is inevitable and cumulative without immediate risk. The "And then" sequencing prevents a legible closure unit with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is solid: curiosity leads to a barrier, which forces the lie (the pivotal action), resulting in discovery and job loss. Closure lands with a clear cost (career sacrificed for truth). However, the inclusion of drafting notes ("No, wait—word count exceeded") in the climax severely disrupts the narrative spell, even if the underlying logic remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a "magic fix" ending where the fragment simply reconstitutes and solves the geopolitical conflict instantly. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction without cost or sacrifice, rendering the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear track with soft causality; the climax relies on a convenient conversation with Tomas rather than a pressure-forced choice. The ending feels thematically imposed rather than earned by the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on a convenient encounter to resolve deep turmoil, bypassing the necessary struggle or rising action. The timeline fractures at the end with an unearned jump from a brief conversation to dawn ("rose as dawn's first light"), suggesting a depth of interaction that was summarized rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a magical rite without significant deepening or complication. While the causal chain works (intention -> ritual -> success), the lack of a "felt or conceptual cost" leaves the closure feeling flat and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to an unearned resolution; the transition from "viewing photos" to "total collective healing" lacks sufficient causal friction. The closure is complete but relies on "magical" efficacy that bypasses the need for genuine struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident and rising action leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The narrative logic holds under an Accumulative/Causal hybrid lens, and the ending crystallizes the character's stance with a conceptual cost (testifying to a void).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The quest structure provides a clear linear drive with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the protagonist accepts the loop. However, the causality of navigating by "echoes" of instantly forgotten visions is convenient, lacking a pivot where the system fails or forces a significant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.7)
    Causality is severely undermined by the premise that a small clock hand spinning at escape velocity would physically propel the entire observatory into space ("unintended escape velocity"). The resolution—using the sound of a falling leaf (0.2s) to time a manual repair on a gear spinning at 1500 RPM—relies on magical logic that breaks the established hard sci-fi frame.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear glide path to a "flawless" resolution without causal turns or earned reversals. The reconciliation is achieved through the "magic" of the scent and song (a soft reset) rather than through difficult choices or paid costs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (find key, insert key, solve puzzle, get map) without meaningful reversal or cost. The resolution is mechanically satisfied by following instructions found on the pedestal, and the "Bending" backstory provides context but fails to generate immediate causal pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence but relies on "dream logic" where causal links are replaced by nonsensical associations (e.g., finding a tooth immediately prompts a specific, unexplained ritual). While a closure unit exists (the fusing of the tooth), it lacks logical grounding or established rules, making the resolution feel arbitrary. There is no tangible cost to the character's transformation; the "substitute body" inciting incident is largely abandoned for a low-stakes garden walk.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear "and-then" sequence where a magical object solves a community-wide problem without failure, adaptation, or cost. The transition from the solitary grotto to the village is abrupt, and the resolution (villagers accepting the light instantly) lacks earned causality or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality hinges on an implausible mechanism—thawing icicles naturally melting into legible, cursive instructions ("Seek the amber glow")—which breaks suspension of disbelief. The closure is a "soft reset" where a gift is exchanged without a dilemma or price, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The accumulative structure is legible and creates a complete arc from despair to resolution. However, the progression is linear and repetitive (encounter, capture, vow) without a meaningful pivot or complication that threatens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a mechanical "and-then" sequence where the protagonist executes a plan without complication or adaptation. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the blight is cured instantly without a visible price, functioning as a soft reset rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clean process arc (preparation, execution, result) with a legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the map changes his direction. The causality is tight, though the "world held its breath" framing feels like a forced pause rather than organic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" progression of trial and success, lacking a Decisive Change that forces a trade-off or meaningful loss. The closure is a "mission accomplished" beat ("timer secure") that validates the premise without exacting the required felt or conceptual cost for a literary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows a linear problem-solution structure but fails the closure requirement for a "felt or conceptual cost." The resolution—calcifying the burdens—is framed as a total victory ("freedom emerged," "promise of next season's harvest") rather than a trade-off. The reliance on a sudden realization of a convenient magical method ("orienting properly") weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, utilizing the boiling kettle effectively as a frame for the flashback and ritual. Orientation is established early, and the closure (snapping the locket, prioritizing the eternal over the temporary) is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident (carousel halt) and a decisive closure (Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration) where Elias trades ambition for groundedness. The logic of the ghost negotiation holds under the Situational/Hybrid lens. Causality is tight, with the wheel's action directly driving the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, montage-like progression with no setbacks or reversals. The resolution relies on a convenient, unexplained interface between an antique sextant and futuristic plumbing ("magical engineering"), which weakens causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a soft reset ending where the conflict resolves because the text declares "peace settled." The climax lacks a decisive turning point or "because/therefore" causality; the environmental mechanics dissolve the tension rather than the character's agency forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: seek, find, realize. Causality is weak; the sundial magically points to the wreck, and the "hindsight clarity" epiphany is triggered by reading an inscription rather than a pressure-cooked realization. The repetition of prompt phrases disrupts the narrative flow and creates a mechanical feel.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, following an accumulative logic. However, the resolution is linear and frictionless; the obstacle (the knot) yields immediately to the tool (glass), resulting in a low-tension sequence. Closure lands as a "happy ending" gain without the requisite felt cost to anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a convenient magical object (the thread) to instantly resolve the central tension of absence, bypassing the earned struggle of healing. Closure is declarative and tidy ("he was whole") rather than resulting from a costly causal chain or genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal arc of assembly leading to a flawed creation is solid, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of beauty as imperfect) lands with a legible result. However, the mechanical causality is somewhat vague, relying on "hypothesized" connections rather than physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment without significant causal disruption or cost; the protagonist plans a graft and completes it exactly as intended. While the sequence is clear, the lack of a "micro-turn" or obstacle makes the closure feel inevitable rather than earned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies on convenience and passive agency; the protagonist simply waits for "breadcrumbs" to appear, and the key is found without struggle. Closure is a "happy ending" reset that costs the protagonist nothing, lacking the required decisive change or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Causal" lens holds, moving from the garden's edge to the core to implant the gear. However, the resolution feels convenient; the fledgling's immediate understanding and behavior change ("eyes widening at the serene visions") resolves the central tension with symmetric satisfaction rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.1)
    The structure relies on a linear accumulation of ghostly visitations without causal friction, creating a lack of narrative tension. The resolution is a "gift" from the specters—an epiphany granted rather than earned through struggle or significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The climax relies on a sudden, unestablished magical physics break (the time-stopping pause) that acts as a deus ex machina to resolve the conflict. This external fix removes the need for a causal, character-driven resolution, resulting in a fable-like structure that lacks grounded narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on convenience rather than causality; the "decoding" of the tapestry is a magical leap where threads literally speak specific sentences ("Not my love, but his greed") without established logic. Closure is weak—Elias simply acquires information and returns the object, resulting in a low-stakes return to status quo with no decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative builds effectively to the "Charged Poise" of the hovering pen, but the closure is undercut by the summary line "Prevail he did, forever." This "told" outcome deflates the tension of the final image and resolves the stakes too neatly without showing the immediate cost of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a soft reset where obstacles (patrol drones) are instantly nullified by "slippery lyrics" without tactical maneuvering or sacrifice. The closure ("famine receded") feels unearned by the scope of the scene, leaping from a single broadcast to global salvation without establishing the necessary causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the kinetic chair’s deceleration, creating a clear, urgent clock that forces the climax. The ritual (drawing, burning, scattering) provides a solid causal chain leading to an earned conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is thematically resonant, though the reading experience is marred by the drafting text at the final beat. (Score capped by Q7 artifact debt).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution hinges on a significant convenience: excavating the precise matching chronometer frame and logbooks in the muck to solve the puzzle. This luck-based plotting resolves the conflict without forcing a costly trade-off or ingenious adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative fails the default scope of a continuous scene, functioning instead as a synopsis or montage spanning months. There is no specific causal chain of events; conflicts are resolved through summarized passage of time ("Across weeks blurring into months") rather than on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is procedural rather than dramatic; Elias arrives, works without impediment, and succeeds. The logic of a "once-in-a-lifetime" event happening every millennium implies impossible biology or math, and the "magic growth" resolution removes the need for struggle or causal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is functional and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly with the restoration of the hive. However, the tension deflates prematurely when Mira, despite demanding "No games," accepts the riddle immediately without meaningful resistance. The causality is linear but relies on the convenient availability of the riddle-solution rather than an earned breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage spanning weeks ("Over weeks," "Word spread subtly") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. The resolution is achieved through a magical fix that encounters no resistance, bypassing causal struggle. The structure lacks a distinct turning point grounded in a specific moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure is a static lecture where the antagonist/mentor explains the plot to the protagonist. The climax (threading the ampoule) is performed by the statue, not Elara, robbing the protagonist of the decisive moment. The story relies on a passive "reveal" structure rather than active causality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal arc is strong, with the mathematical "assault" logically driving the rupture and the subsequent return to stasis. Closure is effective as an Earned Stasis, offering a clear before/after state (loss of the flawless die, confirmation of the trap) that resonates with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    The resolution hinges on a massive coincidence—the random strangers responding happen to be directly linked to Elias's past—which creates a contrived "small world" effect that undercuts the theme of universal connection. The causality of the city interpreting the glyphs through smog is tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.7)
    Timeline credibility is strained by the decision to bake bread (a multi-hour process) during a rapidly escalating flash flood. Additionally, the physical logic of distributing "shards" of a single lens to a crowd breaks causality; shattered glass would render the tool useless and dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the inciting discovery to a decisive closure where the protagonist pays a lethal cost to reverse time. While the mechanism of the "puzzle" is solved too conveniently ("yielded with a snap"), the narrative drive holds under a Causal lens with a legible decisive change at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot relies on convenient "video game logic" where the antagonist explicitly announces its own weakness ("I thrive on hidden truths... unbosom all") to facilitate the protagonist's victory. The backstory regarding the photographic curse is delivered in a momentum-killing exposition dump that temporarily halts the scene's forward drive. Closure is present but feels mechanically earned rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical escalation—a "dome of sound" physically repelling a massive beam—that feels unearned by the established rules. The causality is functional but leans heavily on "technobabble" magic to solve a physical crisis without a commensurate sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid, linking Elara's interrogation directly to the city's doom with a decisive change. The climax relies on an expository shortcut ("visions flooded her mind") to explain the mechanics and backstory, which dilutes the dramatic impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest where the protagonist faces no meaningful obstacles; discovery and decoding happen immediately via convenient competence. The closure is a "fix-it" resolution where the protagonist resolves to publish the truth, lacking a visible trade-off or undeniable price paid on the page. The "whispers of vandals" threat is a false clock that never pressures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative drive is linear, but causality suffers from the "Thorne" coincidence, which resolves the emotional arc through luck rather than agency. The physical logic of the closure—sealing notes in mortar while submerged in a crashing tide—strains plausibility, as fresh mortar would wash away immediately. The transition from surveyor to "legend keeper" is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a decisive change in the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the resolution relies on convenience; the stamp functioning as both a map projector and a physical skeleton key for the vault lacks setup. The closure ("light was reborn... insight") is a standard conceptual repricing, but the lack of personal cost or difficult trade-offs limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual track (polish, ascend, release) with minimal causal complication or resistance. While the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (release of the cranes), the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The premise of the shadow detachment is intriguing but functions largely as a bookend rather than an active driver of the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The plot is a clean, linear procedural: opportunity, action, success. While the inciting incident and objective are clearly defined, the narrative lacks a decisive turn or complication during the hunt, resulting in a predictable trajectory without structural surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where solutions appear conveniently (the chip is right there; drones solve the chart immediately). The climax relies on a "magic button" resolution—pulling a lever to instantly fix deep psychological wounds—which lacks causal weight or sacrifice. Closure is present but arrives through symmetric satisfaction rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on an immense coincidence—finding a specific watch hand and carving on a random shore—to resolve the central mystery. This "magical" discovery shortcuts the investigative process, reducing the earned nature of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, coherent path with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the resolution relies on a frictionless acceptance of the apology; the "false key" backstory provides causality, but the immediate scene lacks a pivot point where the outcome is truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.0)
    Orientation and the physical arc are clear, but the closure relies on a coincidental "celestial nod" (the star appearing) to validate the protagonist's method, which undercuts the agency of the "earthly hack." The resolution feels convenient rather than an inevitable result of the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is fractured; the leap from a signed baseball to decoding newspaper ads for a specific cave relies on convenient intuition ("whispers... insisted"). The closure is a deus ex machina where touching the object magically restores empathy without requiring a sacrifice or decision from Jax.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the protagonist finds a set of instructions and executes them without complication. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—she gains her desire completely—negating the potential cost of the "sacrifice," which is explicitly reframed as a "gift" and "reunion."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax hinges on a convenient discovery—the clockwork mechanism inside the saucer—which functions as a *deus ex machina* to resolve the central conflict of lost time. This "lucky find" lowers the narrative tension, offering a tidy conceptual solution ("time... stored in these intimate relics") without exacting a sufficient causal price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax relies on an unearned attribute activation ("levity was the key") that resolves the plot without prior setup of weight as a constraint. The middle section collapses into a montage, skipping the causal beats of the "shadow work" process.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.0)
    The structure relies heavily on "Deus Ex Machina" logic: a sudden gust of wind and a prophecy the protagonist was ignorant of resolve the central tension instantly. The "coincidences" Elias orchestrated bring people together, but the resolution (magical healing via bug light) is disconnected from his specific efforts, creating a "miracle" ending that lacks earned causality or narrative inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear causal chain, but the progression lacks resistance or complication; Plan A works perfectly. The blackout is introduced as "unexplained" but then immediately identified as a known "test run" that the rebels anticipated, creating a slight logical friction regarding the protagonist's knowledge state. Closure lands with the passing of the item, but the cost is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc (gather dust -> perform ritual -> success) that lacks causal surprises or necessary failures. The ending relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" where the curse neatly inverts into a blessing without a visible, irreversible cost paid on the page. The closure explains the resolution ("He understood") rather than demonstrating it through a reconfigured action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot creates a functional sequence of waiting and replying, but the inciting incident (the envelope's arrival) happens to the protagonist without his agency. The narrative lacks a high-stakes decision; the "vigil" is a passive state, and the resolution—leaving to "rarefy the world"—is an abstract thematic summary rather than a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality is brittle; the conflict resolves via a Deus Ex Machina (the encoded message) and the antagonist's instant, unverified acceptance of it. The closure is convenient rather than earned through struggle or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "Weeks later" summary to bypass the central conflict of the resistance, violating the single-scene/two-shard scope default. The closure is legible but unearned, as the "uprising" and the warden's reaction occur in exposition rather than dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear quest structure, but the causality relies on convenient magic (a film reel acting as a map via "subliminal bursts") and a resolution where music simply overrides reality. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but without a significant paid cost, the victory over fate feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where obstacles (fading memory, shadows) are overcome immediately by the protagonist's skills without complication or setback. Closure is achieved through a "fix-it" sequence—planting, dreaming, waking—that resolves the stakes mechanically. The ending offers a functional Decisive Change (memory restored) but lacks a felt cost beyond the disintegration of the seed tool.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: the protagonist arrives, receives magical instructions, performs a ritual, and is healed. Causality is purely symbolic; the resolution is unearned because the mechanism of change (pruning a tree) lacks a logical or psychological cost-link to the character's internal struggle.

    Accumulative/textural lens holds: chart anomaly cues chip retrieval, drone data accumulates to lever pull as tightening, yielding RR closure in frequency's mend with isolation cost felt in "she belonged here." Orientation anchored early in observatory arrival. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as driftwood discoveries densify regret toward CR closure in the final terrace image clutching the watch hand, with legible conceptual cost of perpetuated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens (causal past raid to exchange + accumulative atmosphere) holds; orientation anchored immediately in parapet/mist/ruin. Closure as Charged Poise in pull exchange and clasp reconfigures grudge with felt cost of relinquishing symbol—"Take it; let it remind us"—one tightening via synchronized untethering.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of regrets and pole-navigation builds to Charged Poise closure with star-pole alignment; cost legible in "regrets receding like ebbing tide" after rogue swell.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: baseball inscription cues newspapers, which guide journey to lake where illusions force confrontation. Orientation anchored early in apartment post-procedure. Closure as Charged Poise in Elara's tear and shared path reconfigures relationship with felt cost of past heists, legible in rippling lake birthing infinities.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fortune cookie incites, spice-gathering and rite build density to RR closure in reunion image with metamorphosis cost legible ("shedding humanity"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph's orchard/moonlight setup. Minor deus ex fortune cookie placement does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to saucer discovery as CR, reweighting lost time with on-page cost ("tears blurred the cards"). Single scene anchored early (post-birth glade by para 1). Closure image of mechanism in swaddling makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadow density builds to pattern break at joy-uncovering stitch, yielding on-page RR (portal opens via integrated tapestry) with conceptual cost of embraced darkness legible in final image; single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from journey to bug release, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where bugs weave prophecy and transformation with felt cost (no gold, purpose solidified). Orientation anchored early in village/beach pull. Closure image—"texture of transformation, gritty as black sand yet luminous"—reconfigures destitution legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly detection to spark activation to ally handoff, tightening rebellion pattern. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in revolution's hum and Elara's plotting smile, with felt risk cost legible in "blackout's embrace." Orientation anchors early; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as rock placements densify power and visions to a conceptual repricing closure: "He understood: the Slip was no accident," reconfiguring curse and promise with transmutation cost legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as timer countdowns density to envelope poem turn, delivering CR closure in reply-seal and descent with perpetual vigil cost legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: deciphering leads to mid-duel reveal ("Coded in the sundial"), yielding alliance as RR/Charged Poise. Closure cost legible in Lang's yield and handshake, with sundial constraint persisting to final image ("angles now pointing true north"). Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorting sparks friendship/tin discovery, density builds to seeding/rebuilding/blooms with weeks-later CR repricing confinement as canvas. Orientation anchored early (moonlit prison library). Closure cost legible in "roots delving deep" vs. warden's rage.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: reel discovery → map memory → navigation → refuge arrival with clock chime as RR closure; cost legible in "final surge nearly swept him" and frozen time thawed.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain from planting seed to dream-interpretation culminates in Charged Poise closure ("doubt whispered—tomorrow's dreams might demand checking anew"), with legible conceptual cost of endless vigilance; single-shard structure with dream transition fits scope, orientation anchored immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens builds motif density to Charged Poise closure where compass reveals cerulean blue, reconfiguring regret with felt cost in tears and diffused petals. Single scene anchors orientation early ("breezy islet," Elara post-Tomas). Lens holds cleanly to ending image of "luminous forgiveness unspoken."


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of fertile silt/dust-laden sleeves reweights her prior ambition with irreversible modesty. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—dust patterns accrue meaning—and holds to the last sentence. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the greenhouse and her former scale of inquiry. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clean by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the melted ledger globe holds pauses as golden voids—conceptual cost legible without exposition. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost-filigree & ledger gaps tighten until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) fixed by line 3; no ambiguity at end. One transition (night → dawn) is legible; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unified glow on winterglass crystallizes a new social contract—silence is no longer void but vessel—while the open case forecloses rest for Elara. Causal linkage holds: each fork strike is because/therefore tied to heat-map readings that tighten the stakes until Kai’s crack forces the final harmonizing gesture. The persistent constraint (perpetual hush) shapes every tactic; felt cost is legible in the etched panes that “now bore eternal heat maps,” a permanent scar of service. No orientation drift; conservatory, twilight, and post-Hush rule-set are anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: Elias becomes the beacon that both “warns and welcomes,” re-weighting the lighthouse’s original duty into an after-life sentence he must eternally serve. Causality holds—each impossible pocket he exploits is pre-seeded by ancient wards, and every shard placement tightens the lattice until silence is purchased with his body. The cost is incontrovertible: “his body pulled into the lens’s glow” is the final beat; the reader feels the price as both transcendence and obliteration. Because the lens’s logic never reverses and the lens-as-solution is foreshadowed in the city’s founding myth, the resolution is inevitable rather than contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: each anonymous basket triggers the next run; the bell peal crystallizes the covenant with communal cost. Orientation lands by line 5 (ridge, arbor, night). Closure is Earned Stasis—Mira’s people accept perpetual shadow risk, foreclosing open defiance. The beat is compressed but legible; no causality break, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unused love is re-priced from hidden treasure to circulating breath, with conceptual cost—Elias forfeits the safety of “storage.” Causal chain holds: sparks → locate Mira → camera/tear reveal blockage → shared breath dissolves it. One soft spot: Mira’s wound recovery is near-miracuous; the text signals no altered-world rules, so credibility wobbles. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; lens stays situational-poetic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fragment’s demise scatters the photograph’s spectral hold, reweighting the premise that fading images equal temporal prisons. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hyperbolic imagery and retrocognitive loops tighten until the lattice snaps. Cost is legible in the line “pixels of past evaporating,” a visible forfeiture. One minor warp: the “method” of hyperbolic rotation is asserted rather than demonstrated, but it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: chained → free, seeds in hand, Wall down. Causality tracks: piano-key cipher found because she daily scanned prizes; floorboard opens because she pre-looped chain; hatch shut because bullets arrive—each because/therefore tight. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (dream-like carnival husks) is taught in line 1 and pays off when the same plush bear stops the arrow. Cost is visible—chains abandon her wrists in the final image—so lens (Causal) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hearing aid’s first utterance of the snap→hush reweights every prior silence and colors the sunken world with caution’s new timbre, cost paid in brine-tears. The accumulative pattern (harvesting absences → layering voids → auroral imprint) is taught by 25 % and tightens once, mirroring cell-division clock. Lens holds: because each absence is forged into the spiral, therefore the final quiet is both weapon and wound.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sunset → moonlight → train night, each light phase reweights the stake. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: jar-beam spill revalues her life’s thefts as quests. Cost is undeniable—“world reinterpreted itself whole.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One shard transition (gallery→platform) taught by “later” cue. Minor non-closure slip: teleporting bouquet on platform arrives without prior plant, but jar+portrait charge overrides.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the room converted to “alive with potential inquiry” reweights the premise and carries conceptual cost—he has staked his nomadic past. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each glass orb adds density until the cadence shift crystallizes meaning. The lens holds, but the thaw-heart metaphor is stated more than dramatized, muting the felt price a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: because Harlan forged her identity → therefore Elara flees → therefore deciphers cast → therefore doses Harlan with his own sea-fear → therefore earns self-reclamation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are crystalline by line 40. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: she remains phobic but now owns the shakes. Persistent constraint—her phobias—shapes the decisive tactic (plunge & aerosol) and lingers in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the map fragment crystallizes options while the last star gutters, re-weighting the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because the oracle retells via silence, therefore the map emerges and Elara leaves with tangible hope. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hush & flake builds toward final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the lone star’s disappearance and the booklet’s gilded dust—both on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the second paragraph: each loop thickens pattern density until the cadence snaps into linearity. Orientation clean by line 5; spatial anchors hold. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s disappearance reweights the premise—thoughts are not found but iteratively forged—leaving the robot poorer in wonder, richer in self-knowledge. No causality breaks; the tightening is the accretion itself, paid for with the instrument’s loss.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: crystal echoes and ticket-images layer density until the hush itself re-weights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—two silhouettes in embrace, crystals whole—whose conceptual cost (shared solitude exposed) is legible. Orientation is taught early via “crystal whispering forecourt after rain,” waiving any anchor penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the lens’s scavenged origin is mentioned once and never exploited later, but it does not break the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned polishing, orb-by-orb, intensifies density until a cadence shift (cracked 1.9 → 9.3) reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fountain ejects an unblemished marble that re-sets the luck metric and forces the council retreat. Cost is legible in Elias’s cracked skin and decades of 1.9 public shame. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nexus reweights time itself, forcing the station into “sideways” perception forever. The causal chain—covert schematics inside drone repairs → lever → magnetic lattice peels reality—holds under a Causal lens, and the price (consensual reality permanently altered) is unmistakable in the final image. Orientation is taught early via “jagged cliffs of Elysara Prime” and “twilight hush,” so no debt applies. The ending refuses to explain the new rule-set, trusting the charged image to carry cost; that gamble pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rising flood swallows the program but Elias keeps the score, a crystallized before/after with undeniable conceptual cost (the opera house lost, his life re-routed). Causal chain holds: slashed lantern → wave → map revealed → grate pried → case found. One minor warp: the “unresolved glyph” that demands dryness is introduced late, so the lantern-slash feels 5% engineered rather than inevitable. Orientation is swift—who/where/when anchored by line 40—and the single-scene default is met.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return of aurora, berry weight, and charcoal smudge deepens the stake until the final “swallowed truth” reconfigures her vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise—illustration forever altered, station creaking, aurora pulsing—cost is legible in the permanent smear and the off-page death she now carries. One tight scaffold: “certainties began to sway” is repeated with rising intensity, taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; causality of berry→misperception→fatal outcome is coherent if oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain: tunnel entry → wheel discovery → radio confession → valve turn → closure holds cleanly; the late reveal that the caller is Jax retroactively tightens linkage under a psychological-causal lens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; single-scene default met; one transition (radio break) is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “truth expelled…feather-light” reweights guilt and reconfigures Jax’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint: snapped beads as residual absolution shape final image, satisfying Q2 9+ cost test with only hairline slip—retrospective confession is told, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper attains regenerative silence and consciously renounces surface change. Causality is lyrical–accumulative; each fold of the swan deepens texture rather than tightens plot, but the pattern is taught early and honored in the final image. Cost is conceptual—the eternal erosion of self in chronicling—made legible in “reality’s grip slackened further.” A small orientation wobble at the burrow transition (−0.2) keeps it shy of the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the locket transfer reweights both griefs and future possibility while the corona glows, cost felt in Elias’s relinquishment. Causal chain holds: eclipse timing → music → shared gaze → object hand-off → first words. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift. Minor elasticity: the “softly adaptive” motif is declared more than it tightens options, keeping the cost whisper-small rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Thorne’s decision to weave the dragons into the archive reconfigures the silo from prison to compass, cost legible in self-condemnation to perpetual dreamlessness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absorbed grief tightens until the tapestry reprises. Orientation anchored by 120; no lens ambiguity. Causality is intact, but the axis-as-chronicle revelation is 80% reflection-fed; a single on-page probe beat is the only live causality. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies for the slight outline-like sequencing of diaries-to-tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: cookie prophecy → discovery of specs → encoded bait → beam trap → arrests. Closure lands as Decisive Change with public exposure, though the personal price is thin. Orientation is swift; lighthouse/tavern anchors appear by line 20. One minor causality wobble: spies instantly trust altered coordinates without skepticism, softening the trap’s credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final pedal click leaves “eternal silence” resonating, reweighting all prior loops with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each rhetorical layer thickens the hush until the shadow stalls, a clean because/therefore under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is swift—anchor, priest, shadow—within 50 words. One micro nit: “white paint” shifts from pigment to metaphysical seal without on-page cue; a 0.1 lens wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored horizon folds time, the shell pulses warm, and the unheard symphony lingers—conceptual cost undeniable. Causality is accumulative/textural: each mapped memory thickens the orchestral texture until the lake itself vibrates; no causal reversals are needed. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“glass spire perched by the frozen lake”) and the lens holds without ambiguity. The only minor slip: the ethereal boy’s late appearance is under-motivated, but he serves as echo rather than pivot, so the image still reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is decisive and costly: integration of the shadow collapses the maze and resumes suspended time—before/after legible, price paid on-stage. Causal chain holds: tablet + viaduct initiate → successive retraces tighten stakes → final confrontation forecloses option of remaining fragmented. Mosaic structure taught early (“splintered possibilities”, frozen droplets) and transitions stay legible. Minor non-closure accumulation: one paraphrase loop inside the labyrinth tour does not touch the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrored hush filament reconfigures the cavern into a shared resonant chamber and forecloses Elara’s numbness with undeniable cost—her private wound becomes public instrument. Causal chain holds: cracked needle → backward spin → filament discovery → communal rite → her thaw. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Only minor drag: two exposition sentences (“These were backward recorded songs…”) mid-climb could have been dramatized through Elara’s hands reading the etched groove.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-log density and pigeon vectors tighten into the bait revelation. The orienting anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no causality break. Closure is a Charged Poise—her courtyard becomes the calm eye with the tube as relic—cost is felt in the foreclosed option to warn authorities.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3. Causal lens holds: because he smells→therefore UV→therefore sees pollen scripts→therefore understands→therefore inhales grief. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “aromatically cautious anew” with felt cost—path foreclosed, memory accepted. No teleporting props; vial and lantern seeded early. Slight risk of thematic over-articulation in final paragraph, but image of tears drunk by petals reweights prior stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: rope-become-vein fuses with energy, re-weighting time’s texture and foreclosing drifter ephemera; cost is the prison past now inseparable from cosmic insight. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern density, not causal dominoes—culminating in spiral-cadence reconfiguration. Orientation anchor ("terra-cotta grotto beneath that starlight-veiled canopy") arrives within 50 words; no ambiguity. No causal breaks; set-ups (frayed rope, spirals, verse gambit) pay off in final fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chronic hush audibly cracks when Lir releases his father’s half-sentence; shipwrecks vibrate, glass answers—an unambiguous before/after in Accumulative/Textural mode. The lens is taught early (“Sounds dulled to whispers… Lir attuned”) and holds to the final note. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words (“sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks”). Cost is visible: the bowl empties and the violinist’s own unfinished memory—long hoarded—becomes the last echo, leaving him lighter yet lonelier.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: amber static, scent notes, and grief-crystal imagery tighten into a single cadence shift—petal darkening—whose cost (Mira’s grief calcified, Elias’s residue) is legible. No causality breaks; every beat adds density or reframes the half-truth trade-off. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grotto’s hum, spent petal, and Elias’s aloof exit reconfigure meaning without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal spine holds: mis-addressed envelope → locket recognition → mutual donor unmasking → reciprocated friendship. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—public credit traded for private constellation—under a single Causal lens. However, the envelope mechanism is confessed rather than discovered, muting the decisive turn’s punch. No persistent constraint shadows future action, so escalation feels complete rather than reopened.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage holds: tag-migration → group formation → arbor crest → sculptural dedication, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“crystalline orchard perched…”) and never breaks. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed canopy crystallizes communal bonds, cost felt as Elara’s solitary craft is forever fused to the group. One soft spot: the tag’s artist never appears, so the ultimate causal agent is off-stage; still, the group’s shared act satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the Cradle is reached, its birth-of-echoes image captured, and the giant’s stirring yawn supplies a felt external cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—cadence, sculpture, canal pattern build density toward the reconfiguring final image. Orientation is swift; causality stays intact. The only soft spot is the hand-wave “she borrowed nap-minutes” that liquefies the sculptures—mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated, so the price is more poetic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the stone’s pulse + the step “onward” reconfigures options with undeniable emotional cost under the Accumulative lens. Causal chain holds—because Elowyn vanished, therefore Thorne studies chips, therefore he dovetails eyes, therefore the orchard stirs. No teleporting props; glass eyes commissioned earlier, wand sourced on-site. Mosaic pattern taught by 25 % and constrains final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: crawl-space invisibility renounced on the page, price legible—he can never again hide. The inferred lens is Causal: because he finds the tape fragment, therefore he caches it, therefore the woman hears the voice, therefore he steps forward. No orientation lag; who/where/when anchored in first 50 words. Cost is not just emotional but existential: the chalk seam he leaves becomes the visible scar of his renounced anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because he wants inside knowledge, therefore he brews/tastes, therefore bark erupts, therefore he roots—each beat narrows escape routes. Closure is Charged Poise: “study…eternal now” crystallizes new rules (man-plant, no reversal) with felt conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 60 (nursery edge, storm season). No teleporting props; linden leaf set-up paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias affixes the brooch to the easel, crystallizing “convergence with purpose.” Causality holds: rain trails → pool → artifact → exchange → artistic refocus. Cost is visible: he trades away ancestral rarity for meaning, accepting sleepless grind as the price—final sentence concedes “life flowed anew” yet still “beyond the walls,” so the price persists. Minor slip: Mira’s ancestral claim arrives late as spoken backstory, softening the because/therefore linkage a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: pearl → awaken forces → inhabit → transfer seed. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at “she opened herself” forecloses retreat with visible agony. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl pressed into Thorne’s palm reweights the stakes and carries the cave’s cost outward.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the punch validates passage and the gates part, reconfiguring Elias from observer to archivist with conceptual cost (“maps richer, certainty unshaken”). Causal chain holds—each punch thunks open the next threshold—though the leap from dissolved bricks to ghost-train seat is slightly teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: tile’s arrival → warming → memory unlock → transcription vow → tile placed as invitation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the square’s glow at the platform’s heart re-weights the tower from observation post to communal memorial. Cost is legible—she abandons pure skepticism and her private grief becomes shared archive. One soft causality: the fisherman’s “cursed thing” warning is never acted upon (no refusal or consequence), a small unkept setup.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: immortality’s stasis is mutinied into eternal novelty—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (“eternity fragmented—not ended, but reborn”). Causal chain is present—fragment touch → dimensional sight → storm harness → veils tear—yet some beats compress into lyric summary, softening the therefore linkage. Orientation is swift; the escondite and storm are anchored by word 60. One scaffold loop: “hushed thunder” is used four times in 750 words, but the pattern pays off in the final line, so the penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the alley image reconfigures stakes—freedom bought with father’s amoral solvent. Causal lens holds throughout; each beat because/therefore links ink discovery → vapor insight → patrol math → breach. No orientation debt; “funeral home prep room” anchor arrives by line 3. The 247-second loop is the visible constraint that shapes tactics and charges the final moment; cost is the implicit erosion of Eli’s ethical rigidity, felt but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the open notebook releases frost-bound voices back up the slope, undeniable cost paid in Thorne’s spent pages and the town’s regained song. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dawn hum layers density until the pattern snaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“mountaintop…stationer”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. The −0.4 for lens clarity is waived because the accumulative pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and honored: each tide-borne fragment thickens the perceptual “skin.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the label rewrites the bureaucratic death into sabotage, cost legible in the final smile. One smooth transition (low-tide discovery → high-tide acceptance) keeps structure within 800-word mosaic default.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of humming voices layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake from “disprove ghost” to “affirm seeking.” Closure is a Charged Poise: shell silent, compass spent, Elias descending with lighter step—cost is the spent talisman and the irreversibility of fabricated meaning. Causality inside the hum sequence is causal-mini (each voice summoned because of shell-cello resonance), but global drive is accretive. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 30. The −0.4 non-closure cap reflects slight over-reliance on lyric summary between hums, dilating micro-turns.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carnival endures, privatization is stalled, and the stone’s warmth implies communal cost was real. Causal chain holds: graffiti coordinates → raft shuffle → yacht blocked, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the yacht-spray climax is narrated mid-drift without showing how Elara physically reaches the hull without being intercepted—an ellipsis that slightly blurs agency.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: curiosity → forbidden climb → oxygen drain → chemical-SOS → dawn rescue. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grain’s micro-etchings reconfigure the mission’s meaning while the rover light confirms survival cost. One minor causality bump: the suit’s sudden “faster than calculated” drain is declared, not foreshadowed by exertion detail.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: every refractive shimmer or vibration thickens the same stake—can the bird fly before the anchor clears? Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias stands “serene vigil,” the depot now forever his horizon; the cost is the voyage he’ll never take. Causality intact; no orientation debt. Single micro-turn (first wing immersion) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the salute toward the headwaters crystallizes converging fates and reweights all prior artifacts under an undeniable conceptual cost—map, bird, breath, editor are now indivisible. Causal lattice is tight: vellum → translation → condensation pattern each narrow options in sequence. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Lens ambiguity test is waived; the accumulative/textural design is taught early and holds. Minor cost-wobble: the plateau guardian threat is only foreshadowed, not yet paid, but the closing image makes the risk felt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike thickens sensory density until the ghost-footfall chorus crests into perceptible rebuilding. Orientation is clear by word 60; no causal gaps appear, yet the cost is purely spectacle—no option narrows for Elias, no price sticks to him—so the Resonant Reconfiguration feels weightless. Closure is legible but not freighted, capping ascent into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (muted light, coral, biolum phosphorescence) thickens atmosphere toward the orb harvest; closure is Charged Poise—she rises “forever changed,” the hush now her “eternal companion,” a conceptual re-pricing of solitude. Orientation anchored within first 70 words; no prop or knowledge teleports; the vial’s perfume plume functions as taught pattern paid off in calm that overrides panic. No meaningful tightening beat beyond the final grip on orb, but that single crystallization satisfies the lens. Cost is the last breath traded for relic—visible on critical O₂ alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens dominates: spiral descent, recurring copperlight, lattice pulses, and body count accumulate into a tightening hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—hovering shades fuse into silence while Elias pockets the lattice, a conceptual re-price that makes reef hush the new authoritative “story.” Causality holds inside each beat (lattice → anchors shadows → reveals path → earns silence) even if reef-collapse backstory is summarized. Cost is unmistakable at the last image: he replaces the lattice imperfectly, admitting perpetual instability. Orientation is clean within 50 words; transitions between chapel alcove, labyrinth, core chamber are tracked by lattice & scuffs.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each cameo and fruit-eating thickens texture and reweights the stake until the final charged poise. Orientation is immediate—alchemical greenhouse, endless night, lone alchemist—well inside 120 words. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers united across the veil, cost paid by Elias’s mortal death, final image of the pulsing greenhouse. No prop teleport or causality break; bead drops early and loops back in final runes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn tapestry visibly reweights village rules, cost felt in the ruined docks left behind. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (“sleepwalkers roamed”) and paid off when Elara’s needle makes the invisible overlaps visible. One soft teleport: the satchel spools appear without prior mention, a minor prop glitch that does not rupture the image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aligned shadow re-orients Elara toward the sacred mountain, re-weighting earlier exile, visible in “time’s wheel turning unbroken.” Causal chain holds: exile → orchard → excavation → sundial → rekindled vocation. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered. However, escalation is gentle—no tightening beat forecloses an option or raises tangible price; tension remains contemplative rather than consequential under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chalk heart reweights every prior “margin,” turning the arcade itself into an off-grid drop. Causal chain holds—chalk cipher → photo → margin transcription → post chute; each step narrows escape routes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“golden arcade at dawn”), well inside the 120-word limit. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “low-tech vs. high-gloss” intensifies until the final heart crystallizes the cost of staying analog.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because she spots forged star-threads, therefore she re-stitches, therefore slips the corrected chart to the palace, foreclosing the coup. Closure is the charged poise of her continuing to embroider while the realm’s fate is now altered—undeniable conceptual cost visible in the candle’s approving flare and the autumn leaves that echo approaching soldiers. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within the first 60 words; orientation never wavers. No info teleporting; every celestial or tactile detail is earned on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (singing spirits, moonlight, condensation) intensifies the stake rather than causes external turns. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words: mangrove labyrinth, dusk, Elara with shard. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers’ embrace crystallizes options without erasing prior cost—lunar glow keeps the price visible. Minor elasticity in causality—spirits’ cooperation feels given rather than negotiated—but the final image’s undeniable tenderness reweights the rule-set, satisfying CR.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of coral/knot imagery reweights stakes toward the final Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 7; no penalty. Closure is a clean CR: the pocketed fragment reprices both their unspoken griefs. Felt cost is the tear-graft and the vow to carry the fragment—visible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: luminous orchard projection crystallizes options—she can leave but forever carries fog-etched joy; cost is the irreversibility of exposure (“perpetual glow”). Causal chain holds: fragment find → light-expose → network amplify → project → retreat; each because/therefore tightens. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—fog never fully lifts—shapes final image. Minor ellipsis in how network mechanics are accessed doesn’t break causality at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: coin-hum ➔ fractal sound ➔ Lena’s pulse shift is legible and irreversible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her softened gaze forecloses lifelong debunking with visible cost (certainty surrendered). One scaffold loop (“methodically playful” repeated three times) nicks propulsion but does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the gourd seeds make thought permanently untaxable, cost paid by the greenhouse’s destruction and Elias’s exposure. Causal chain holds—seed → warp → beetle cloak → broadcast—though the mid-section jumps from kale plots to greenhouse without showing how drone pressure forced the move. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the fruit-harvest beat satisfies length. Lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each spiral echo, bioluminescent verse, and lullaby layer thickens the same stake—will he trade wakeful agony for blossom peace? Orientation is taught early via reef-filtered moonlight and shell acoustics, so spatial rules are legible. The midpoint tightening occurs when galaxies on the postcard literally align with his wall-verses, a pattern break that foreshadows fusion. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “sleep’s blossom armistice bloomed fully” images the cost—his century of night-watch ends, voice absorbed into shell resonance—felt and undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is crisp: cracked tube → echo-song → light → orchid bloom → name preservation, repeated in four wings with rising stakes. Closure is a decisive change: the tube shatters, path foreclosed, all names secured but tool destroyed. Cost is visible—“bamboo shards tinkling like final regrets.” Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the symphonic burst reweights their stance, the glass ink well dims as persistent constraint, and the fingertip talisman forecloses future silence. Causal linkage holds: each promise unravels a knot → sound reveals memory → trust crystallizes. Time/place anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chain becomes a bridge, the volcano breathes unflooded, and Elias accepts perpetual vigilance. Causal linkage holds: adhesive analysis → decoded plea → redesigned sluices. Accumulation of “breathing” cadence tightens stakes. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation is taught early and repaid in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine holds: forged journals → discovery → rupture → confession → shared balance; each beat alters options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the chip stays balanced, the past stays rewritten, but trust is newly shared—cost felt in the admission “bought for a pittance.” One minor elasticity: the unburned letters appear late yet are accepted because they contradict Elias’s myth, intensifying rather than rescuing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each newly revealed pattern (grain, weather code, compass) tightens the same stake—how to honor necessary distance. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elowen steps across the threshold while the prism beams reconfigure the maze below, crystallizing the cost that “lose the light” warned of. Orientation is taught early via the “drifting prism terrace” and “fractured light,” anchoring who/where within 50 words. No causal break; every increment deepens the texture of sacred distance rather than advancing plot in linear fashion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: luminous density escalates through bioluminescent pulses, firefly arrival, and feather glow; the shared exhale is the tightening that reweights belonging from concept to shared breath. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sunrise floods viewport, feather handed over—undeniable cost felt in visible gift and altered stance. Orientation anchored by ~120 w (“midnight tides whispered against rusted bulkheads”). No meaningful causality break, though Theo’s arrival drifts close to fortunate coincidence that the text converts into mutual captivation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (geode glow, seed patter, glass flare) deepens the dominant stake of vanishing paths until the final Charged Poise reframes loss as migratory necessity. The closing conceptual reprice—paths vanish to become seeds—is legible and felt, but the early causal hook (why her own fork “winked out”) is answered more by lyrical echo than by dramatized cause, keeping it just outside 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: bishop scatter → Elara retrieval → stranger connection forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arcade’s “monotony” is conceptually repriced as a living board where creative collisions can be engineered. Cost is felt—Jasper melts into shadow, forfeiting credit, and Elara’s re-ignited creativity is nascent, fragile. One hiccup: the tattooed man’s queen appears without prior plant, a late convenience that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: wings fold to vapor while Kai’s glowing skin locks Elara into mortal time; cost is reweighted by the spent speck and foregone sky. Causal chain holds: lunar speck → anchoring → gap-reading → reversal → flight → inscription; no teleporting props. Orientation is lyric-delayed (who/Kai unnamed until balcony) but pattern is taught early by star-syntax obsession and pays off in final skin-verse, waiving penalty. Accumulation lens dominates: density of star-gaps rewrites options rather than external plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism shard talisman crystallizes new resolve while the bay’s pulse syncs with his, re-weighting stakes under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: each ripple reading tightens his knowledge of communal fracture and his role. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (who/where/when). Cost is visible—“renewed resolve” is the foreclosed path of passive mending. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is intact—fire survivor meets fire orphan, trades box for vow—but closure lands as declarative beat (“I won’t bargain mine away angry”) rather than image with cost; no new option is foreclosed for Elias. Orientation is clear by word 60. Single-scene structure respected; celestial framing returns at end but doesn’t reweight meaning. The porcelain box is set up, handled, referenced, yet its final beat is sentimental token, not tactical object. Cost is asserted, not shown: Elias leaves ridge unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the gauge’s final steady needle reweights hope’s rule-set across timelines; because/therefore linkage holds as each balloon launch recalibrates both pattern and gauge, and the last image carries undeniable conceptual cost—“equations etched into hearts.”

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the film-strip vision reweights the family premise and Elias vows confession, cost felt in the instant the manor’s hum “softens.” Causal chain is sound—diary → darkroom → film → revelation—but the foreclosure is oratorical (“he vowed”) not embodied action. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lullaby layer thickens density until the final bell toll reweights the city’s mirrors. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality of heartbeat-borrowing is shown through sensory choreography, not exposition. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elowen dissolves but the altered reflections remain—cost legible in “borrowed heartbeat echoing forever.” Minor slip: heartbeat mechanics are told once rather than demonstrated mid-transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: the instant Elara’s blood hits the page, the forever war’s rule-set resets—stars literally halt—making the conceptual cost undeniable. Causal lens holds throughout: every signature is a because/therefore fork triggered by her operatively gentle call-outs that force each warlord’s hand. Orientation is locked by word 60 (“ancient terrace atop Mount Elysara”). The spectral boy’s appearance is not retroactive omniscience but the embodied price she has been carrying, paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because he engineered the drought, the salt-flat map appears; because the map mirrors huia flight, he obeys its summons; therefore the egg is placed where water once flowed. Closure is a Charged Poise: storm breaks, salt dissolves, but huia resurrection remains uncertain—cost is the irreversible gamble he can never verify. Orientation anchored by 40 words; spatial choreography of boots, cracks, and hollow tracked without drift. Persistent constraint: the map he commissioned now dictates his lone spiritual act, a corporate godfather cornered by his own blueprint.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the loom’s shatter reweights conformity—but causality is vague: why does purity unlock the prism? Orientation is clear; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation feels like decorative layering rather than narrowing options. The “harvest” beats repeat without tightening the noose; the last knot’s resistance is declared, not tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias reverses the stick, reads his own inverted tale, and accepts the permanent forfeiture of subversive puppet power. Causal lens holds: because the troupe walkout exposed a cruelty, therefore he dismantles the method. Cost is visible—he severs puppet strings in memory and walks into meteor dark stripped of former thrill. One scaffold loop (“half-lit epiphanies” phrase recurs seven times) slightly dulls the final image but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: towers fall, monarchs surge on, the freed moth wing drifts into their slipstream—conceptual reprice that honors impermanence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each knot and wing-fragment layers density until wind dissolution becomes inevitable. The drive lens is declared in the first paragraph and never contradicted; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words. Cost is legible in the snapped clove hitch and the “golden script” of pollen dust that will never be read again.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: auroral light pours through re-braided rope, casting audible names onto ice—conceptual cost is the lifelong burden of archive-bearer, shown in the sling-over-shoulder image. Causal lattice holds: guilt → exile → card find → rope mod → illumination → sound casting. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of thaw/aurora imagery tightens stakes until final cadence shift. Persistent constraint: re-woven rope now forever glows with voices, a portable price she must shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment she laughs “precisely playful into the wind” reweights every prior echo, fusing past/future into present with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of decaying text and charged returns (sigil, seal, whispers) tightens once at the end. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored inside first 120 words. Causality holds: each vision and riddle narrows options toward transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the palace becomes conduit, Ezar’s frugality re-weighted as devotional lens; cost is the oil he will never burn again. Causal chain holds: tile find → schematic mapping → covenant utterance → gate opens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Babylonian palace”) and regime limbo is felt throughout. One causal micro-gap: why the tile loosens precisely now is left to cosmic irony—tolerable under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is earned: the broken pin skips until Thorne’s stance flips—his exhale dissolves resentment and the sanctuary stabilizes; cost is the permanent loss of his war-identity. Causal chain holds: each skip of the pin → memory surfacing → sanctuary warping → Elias winding again; no teleporting props. Lens is causal throughout, taught by the first broken-music-box appearance. Orientation anchors at once: “soundless sanctuary,” name-tags, and the bleeding stranger land by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: dream-wife steps through, boundaries erased, the orchard “felt whole,” but the price is tacit—he now lives inside an hallucination he engineered. Causal linkage holds—each mirror placement and breath-sync narrows options until only merger remains. Sextant’s cracked sights and frost-numb knees are persistent constraints that shape tactics and linger in the final image. Cost is legible in the last clause: “for the first time in years, the orchard felt whole” signals he has traded reality for solace.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each beat—bag spill, ribbon reprise, quartz hum—because/therefore tightens the breach until the heart-tree eye re-lights, foreclosing the option of solitary persistence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s excess is revealed as starvation of vows, the cost legible in the rafters’ creak and the ribbon now binding daughter to beam. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (pews, vines, apex quartz) track cleanly within the single escalating scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: repeated motif of “between pages/liminal spaces” intensifies meaning rather than plot. Orientation is swift (asteroid, bathroom, orchard). Closure is a Charged Poise: “live between the pages” crystallizes her new stance with conceptual cost—she forfeits linear life. Cost could be sharper if the final beat showed consequence on her body or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: traveler arrives → diary reveals keys → rescues yield artifacts → gaps exploited → pact renegotiated. The “botanical intermediary” loophole is set up early via the diary and paid off at the end, producing a clean Conceptual Repricing: the mist-parting image reconfigures worth from scholarship to symbiosis. Causality is nudged rather than tightened—each rescue gifts the next token without escalating Elara’s personal risk—so the closure is bright but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog-dream fragments layer until the garden gate blooms. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the card dissolves, the twins accept endless rediscovery—but the cost is abstract (“peace without fire”) rather than viscerally felt. Causality is lyric, not sequential; while the pattern is taught early, the missing orientation anchor (where is she on the ship, how much time passes) and the soft victory blunt the tightening required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal linkage holds: impossible door → fables → seal → rope re-weave → tower restored, each step because/therefore. Closure is a tidy Resonant Reconfiguration: absence is literally woven into the mechanism, the clock ticks again, and Elara’s ledger updated signals conceptual cost—she now carries the hidden timeline. The price is oblique (no bodily or social loss), but the final image reweights the university’s lore, satisfying the low bar for 600-word closure. Deduction for mild causality over-determination: the rope’s “starlight” compartments appear exactly when needed, a convenience that lightly weakens constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: final image of “quiet that endures” reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—eternal guardianship. Accumulative lens holds: density of ripple/crack imagery intensifies until silence blooms; pattern break is legible. Causality intact—stone placement follows mapped cracks, no teleport. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of star-alignment imagery thickens until the final beam reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—beam ignites, options reconfigured, cosmic silence converted into summons—cost is the irrevocable exposure of her solitude to future pilgrims. Causality holds: shard→sharpened visions→star map→beam; no prop or rule appears late. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each shadow-measurement tightens the pattern of memory-loss until the final Charged Poise (“identity was collective… forged in shared hush”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation. Closure lands on-page; persistent constraint (she must keep measuring or forget herself) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: spinner’s knot → filter → mosaic blueprint → built rocket → sky-bloom → villagers’ wonder; the final image of vines claiming the scaffold supplies visible conceptual cost, earning Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes when the cicada’s molt re-prices her leaving as rebirth, not loss. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each ripple, star-refraction, and shell-texture beat deposits density until the final image reweights the stake. The cost is legible—“time’s true skin” carries permanent, tactile loss of the old form. One hairline slip: “years flickered tangentially” is slightly abstract, blurring the exact moment of reconfiguration, holding the score just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens: each silence gathered thickens the stake; inversion acts as pattern-deepening cadence shift. Closure—Elara floating down, doll brimming, father’s hammers distant—earns Charged Poise: her stance is crystallized, cost legible in the opulent weight on tongue and porcelain. No causal contradiction; gravity rule is taught early, inversion complicates rather than rescues. Orientation clean by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the prism refractions and crystal blooms build a pattern of quiet-as-substance that tightens into the foam-hush climax. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; space, time, and who are legible. The closure beat—the family stepping away hushed yet joyful—delivers a Charged Poise that re-weights “quiet” as active comfort. Cost is felt conceptually rather than personally, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is pristine: flake → mural → trapdoor → stair → throne, each beat because/therefore. Dawn’s first ray as the final key is seeded by the chrono-implant warnings, paying off with visible cost—she gains stewardship but forfeits personal rule. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city-wide orchard bloom reframes power as caretaking, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: heating the ring reweights the premise—severance as oxygen. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each night thins the veil, the ring is the final pressure spike, and the burn stabilizes the threshold. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; no persistent bodily/relational price is legible on the page. Orientation is lyrically delayed but taught early (“ashen charcoal sanctuary”) and pays off; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each glitch-text tightens options until the bolt-turn becomes inevitable, paying off the submarine relic planted early. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—pyramid shame transmuted into shared diamonds—visible in the outbound texts. The cost (shared vulnerability across timelines) is felt, though compressed into one ecstatic beat rather than foreshadowed tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: papers burn, name dies, Elias walks into darkness—cost is the manor’s last breath and his own erasure. Causal lens holds: crank-turn → acoustic cipher → hidden panel → fire → exile, each beat a because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the unsnap releases tangible threads that reweight every prior pattern and bind Elowen’s future to an unchosen stage. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory intensification (juices etching paths, vapors solidifying orbs) deepens cost rather than forcing causal turns, ending in an unmistakable conceptual price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 inside the greenhouse; no debt. The clasp unsnap is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the button and letter re-weight the archive from bureaucratic tomb to living testament of interracial tenderness, with visible cost shown in the final beat—Eleanor polishes the button, committing herself to further searches under perpetual uncertainty. The dust-pattern seam is both coincidence and mechanical pivot; because she notices the anomaly she gains new knowledge, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is nailed inside 50 words; no causality breaks or teleporting props. Persistent constraint established: the false compartment suggests others may exist, giving future tactics and compounding her workload—cost is felt even though no physical danger occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: map → lagoon → booth → slates → broadcast, each step opening the next with the key as pivot. Orientation is clean within 120 words; city, dusk, alley anchored through Elias’s motion. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the holographic reveal reweights the regime’s “myth” and forecloses Elias’s anonymity with felt cost (he seals the booth, now hunted). Minor causality gap: how orbital relays stay hidden from regime tech is elided, but does not snap the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the hush is achieved yet tremor remains, cost felt in ragged breath and lightened step. Causal chain holds—because he inverts code through reed-whisper, therefore prophecy fragments; each pause narrows options until silence vests. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. One causal micro-turn suffices for this length; lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s renewal is re-valued as dependent on Lir’s seed-shrines, with the moonstone-turned-sylph leading the descent—cost is the unknown plunge into ash. Causal chain holds: monuments → awaken transformeds → decode map → descend to relics. One minor scaffold: “mossy delight wove through Lir’s laughter” appears three times in fifty words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence, not because/therefore, reweight the stake, and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: pocket-watch pattern → compass rose → waterfall fissure → journals delivers a legible because-chain that tightens options. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: Thorne’s maxim reweights Elias’s premise on-page, cost felt in the ash-smudged journals he pockets. Orientation anchored by line 4; no gaps. One soft spot: clocks’ 3:17 pattern is declared, never explained or paid off, a minor unkept set-up that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin halts balanced on its edge, Thorne freed, Elara’s craft reborn with kintsugi gold literally sealing the astral fracture—cost is the permanence of those golden scars. Causal chain holds: overloaded name → cracked crucible → gold-infused repair → counter-weighted coin. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: “phoenix ash” appears without prior world-rule, but it pays off instantly in the repair beat so the lens stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens accrues through echo-layers; closure is a Charged Poise: gorge hush + cooling pendant crystallize cost without narrative over-explanation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 40 words; no penalty. One deepening—Harlan’s laughter finally released—reweights the stake; options narrow to “carry on” with heavier heart, visible in Elara’s faint smile. Persistent constraint (pendant’s heat) shapes every climb and pluck, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: “rooted yet free” reweights earlier displacement, the math no longer ghost but map, cost felt in her cardiac arrhythmia. Drive lens toggles from Accumulative (strand after strand of sensory memory) to Situational crystallization; pattern is taught by UV forest mirroring neural webs, paid off when bark angles resolve into formulae. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are intentionally delayed yet serve the final payoff, satisfying the disorientation waiver. Only lapse: lead-inquisitor demand “it’s ratios” momentarily lectures the concept rather than letting image prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the holographic annals reframed in mid-air reweight the market’s—and the reader’s—sense of history with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds throughout: each painting-detail discovered → lens warms → histories unbound. Orientation is taught early (“eternal instant” signals frozen-time lyric mode) and anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5, so no orientation penalty. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density shift rather than a reversal, but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore progression from dust → mainspring → grate → bones → release. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ceiling’s literal cracks and the circus’s cracked façade are repriced into exposed truth, with the ghosts’ sigh as undeniable social/emotional cost. One minor slack: the watchmaker’s backstory arrives as a compressed info-dump rather than a present-tense obstacle, but it pays off immediately in the key turn, so causality is only nicked, not broken.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal linkage is immaculate: frost pattern → broadside → descent → rupture → collapse, each beat tightening options until the library’s fall forecloses return. The closure is a charged poise—Elias fused to eternal moment—whose cost is the literal shattering of order. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“glass orchard library”), so no penalty applies. The only hairline slip is a single adverbial cluster (“cryptic no more”) that briefly tells the laugh, but the image still reconfigures stakes irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: shard’s allure → storm plan → mirror ingress → shard seizure → shattering that rewrites scholarly war. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when visible). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—by atomizing the shard Elias forces new myth-making, paying with permanent exile from scholarly record. Persistent constraint (mirrors veiled to survive storm) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: sun returned, daughter eyes open—Decisive Change with felt cost (light reclaimed). Causal chain is loose: “infinitesimal adjustment” inexplicably transmutes cosmic shadow; the chip’s rule-set is never established, so the turn reads magical rather than earned. Orientation clean by 120 words; chamber/music-box logic is accumulative-textural, not causal, and holds. No constraint persists for Elias after victory—price is paid by midnight, not by him—so cost is legible but not character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s stance is re-configured from outsider factory-worker to guardian-initiate, cost visible in the translucent mentors who merge with her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each hinge pull intensifies density and reweights petrichor from quaint hobby to ontological key. Causality remains intact: compass → vision → hinge → transformation. One soft spot: the expedition’s fate is delivered in vision-summary rather than dramatized beat, a minor chilling effect.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara steps into a wind-cleared path carrying the lantern-sculpture; cost is felt because the GPS failure + alliance vision reweights her solitude as portal. Causal chain holds, but causality is lyrical rather than strict; lens = Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each postcard and glass layer adds density until the pattern (flowers = hidden love) breaks open. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is fixed in the first 60 words; no penalty applies. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral’s final image of moonlit lovers reweights all prior blooms into a single conceptual cost—vulnerability’s bargain with darkness. That cost is visible on the page: “tears tracing silent paths” and the pavilion mural that will never see sun, foreclosing mass acclaim.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The diary-triggered retrocognitive plunge is a clean causal hinge; the lagoon vision supplies the Decisive Change with visible cost (spectral parley, debris oath). Transitions stay legible across the two-shard float/vision arc; closure re-enters the zeppelin with a re-weighted mandate, satisfying CR. Orientation anchors arrive before the 120-word drift, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lanterns re-ignite, people materialize, and Elias melts into a world whose rules he has re-priced at visible cost (brow sweat, bottle hum, mental crucible). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each re-manifestation is a density increase that reweights the “ghost town” pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no temporal or spatial drift. One persistent constraint—the seamless bottle—shapes tactics throughout and remains unbroken, its cost legible in the final “tucked away.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy rewrites the skyscraper orchard from quaint anomaly to doom-engine, and Elias’s vow to immerse himself is the visible cost. Causal lens holds: because he stirs the shaving with personal memory, the oracle utters; therefore he must trade observation for participation. No orientation debt; anchors (who/when/where) land by line 30. The final whispered dead-tongue vow is the persistent constraint that will shape every future night.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: egg hatches → entropy threat → cap+seeds reverse decay → vortex reopens → hand plunges → time texture tasted. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the atrium thaws, proving preservation can defy decay, but the price—ancestral years now anchored to her lifespan—remains implied yet legible. One minor causality fuzz: how exactly “genetic precision” of tomatoes rewinds time threads is hand-waved, not tool-taught. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 30; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the switch to bell is decisive, saves villages, and conceptually re-prices warnings from volume to resonance. Causal chain holds: logs → micro-variation → midnight flip → bell harmonizes with wind → villages spared. Accumulated pattern (lyric reprise of “solstice hush”) charges the ending. However, orientation is coy (no concrete who/where until ~150 words) and the lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than strictly causal; both are acceptable but the late anchor keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Elias’s tear-streak reconfigures strength-through-vulnerability with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds—star-tracings layer meaning until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives within 120 words; no penalty applied. One minor causality gap: lantern glass is introduced as relic, yet its sudden use requires no discovery beat, shaving 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box becomes guardian, ghosts nod approval, oasis stirs—cost is the perpetual silence he now shoulders. Causal linkage holds: ghost gesture → unearth box → ritual mending → covenant renewal. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“scorched wasteland… abandoned beekeeping oasis”). No meaningful reversal inside the scene; escalation is accumulative/textural—light beams, vine-knot dissolving—so the lens is Hybrid, coherent at end. The covenant summary is the only causal soft patch, but it pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s eternal sheen rewrites the rules—irrational sums now map time’s grain, and Elias’s garage-sale network becomes legitimate commerce. Causal chain intact: garage-sale clues → open capsule → shard timeless → new vocation; every step because/therefore. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“emerald silo… fractured plains”). Felt cost: the capsule breach that freezes Lira’s ash also freezes Elias out of normal dying—he must eternal-sell forever. Lens = Causal, held without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended kite’s erratic dance re-weights the premise—beauty is unfinished flight, not flawless ascent. Causality holds: snapped string → sodden wreck → feather quill → asymmetrical relaunch, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“burnished hush of the cobalt lagoon after rain”). Cost is legible in the final image: “shorter string in hand,” a permanent constraint that forecloses future high flights. The lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice hums, pilgrims arrive, meaning reweights. Causal chain—diary → wire → pillars awaken—holds, but “architectural secrets” revelation is delivered in visionary summary, not decisive act; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Six-month deadline is declared early yet never narrows tactics; time pressure is ambient, not causal. Cost is conceptual (human guardianship restored) rather than viscerally felt on page; still, the final image reconfigures stakes cleanly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: illicit scan → forsakes post → follows hacked drone prints → converges → synthesises. One coherent scene, <120w anchors (who/where/when) delivered by “bronze quiet spring…ancient tower.” Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “homecoming wasn’t destination, but…convergence” reweights the entire pilgrimage premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits destination-centric science for relational chemistry. No teleporting props; amber’s twitch on plinth pays off prior synthetic-compound hint.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s blooming boards become a living bridge reconfiguring sea/soil relations, with petals drifting into the ink-black sea as undeniable social/ecological cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies from bleached coral bones to luminescent vines, cadence shifting from dirge to renewal song. “Submerged concord” is re-weighted on-page when Thorne’s Eldari incantation revives the pact. Persistent constraint: the coachman must leave, carrying only lightness—garden’s future is unguarded, cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine holds: cylinder → riddle → trek → reunion, each beat clearly triggered by the last. Closure lands as Charged Poise—together they step onto catwalks with new shared vocation—visible cost is the forfeiture of solitary certitude. Orientation is clean by ¶3; lens is Causal throughout. Minor slack: the revelation that Mira now “finds survivors” is delivered, not tested, so the Decisive Change feels slightly under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal lattice is tight: shutdown → isolation → compass twitch → sketch → rift reveal → jump, each because/therefore pivot legible under 120 words. Closure is a decisive change—she abandons the station forever—with felt cost (loss of human orbit, eternal exile) and a resonant reconfiguration: the same sketch custom that began in nostalgia ends in alien soil, now a survival tool. The wormhole is foreshadowed by the compass’s impossibly ‘true north’ twitch, so no late-rule cheat; the lens stays causal to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is clean: wrong sky → theft → swap → mend. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the Arbiter’s sovereignty is quietly usurped by a thief who pockets noon. Sundial’s early anchoring and chess-piece foreshadowing pay off; slight Orientation wobble in first 120 words (who/where taught only by image) but disorientation serves the lyric tilt at closure, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s absent light and tightens the noose on the penumbra; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—chess pieces now cast the shadow he renounced, a visible cost that reweights his archive and the emptied board.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each feather-stroke layers density until the final spiral reweights “home” from absent valley to present labyrinth. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—her mercury eyes “forever changed” makes the cost conceptual and irreversible. Orientation is taught early (“deep within the labyrinthine bookstore”) and pays off when the mountain’s veins become home. No causal breaks; glyphs and dreams track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the village is frozen, therefore Elias can decode the tapestry; because he deciphers his own opening cheat (e4-d5-Nf3), therefore the labyrinth forces him to replay the crime. The closure is a Decisive Change—time thaws—paired with a Conceptual Repricing: the pawn becomes queen, guilt transmutes to grace, and the cost is the irreversibility of that knowledge. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elias sought refuge”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. One micro-turn (mirror revelation) is all the length demands; no escalation break.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each poetry-couplet is a because/therefore missile that widened cracks in ritual authority until monolithic absolution becomes impossible. Orientation anchored by line 20; “hollowed femur” cues who/where/when without exposition. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses retreat by sending the chorus away—dawn will catch her undefended, cost legible in the final sketch she cannot finish. No lens drift; the escalating echo-chamber of refracted verse is the tightening engine.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the workshop rises, acid recedes, and the alchemist’s new certainty is locked to the fused charm-core—cost is the lifelong scars now glowing, irreversible. Causal chain holds: each matched pockmark triggers memory-quilt + mechanical repair, leading to buoyant resurrection. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“uncertain alchemist”) and acid-sea stakes; no ambiguity. One loop—”quilting” overused—doesn’t dent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the hologram’s fade reweights nostalgia from endless ache to cherished illusion, with undeniable conceptual cost signaled by “tears mingled with the spring.” Causal chain—mirror crack → shell completion → hologram reveal → relinquishment—holds without gaps; the wrong turn mechanics are set up by childhood memory and pay off in oasis discovery. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (quay, twilight, studio floor shards). Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Persistent price: the crystal dims forever, foreclosing re-viewing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vial’s spent perfume and Mira’s arrival reweight the “whisper > shout” premise with undeniable emotional cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—Mira’s walk back is magically scent-drawn—but the pattern is taught early and the final image crystallizes options with felt tenderness. Orientation is immediate; only one transition (dawn mist to stair climb) and geography stays coherent. The vial’s rule-set is consistent; no late loopholes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon ignites and reverse migration becomes legible, charged with foxfire cost. Causal chain holds—each midnight call + lunar pulse tightens the next tactical move—so the lens is clearly Causal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no penalty. One minor scaffold: “reverse migration flowed” repeats the concept twice in the closing paragraph, but it does not touch the final image, so −0.2 only in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the antique eye’s persistent glint reweights all prior confessions into optional silence, felt cost legible in “had occlusion truly healed…?” Causal chain holds—probe snags pouch → textbook rite → insertion → immediate lie test—each step tightening social options under storm pressure. Orientation is cleanly anchored inside 120 words via ravine, orchard, nightly storms, and Elias’s sensor kit. One minor elastic: the textbook’s “veritas nerve” is introduced late, but the mad-doctor scribble is cued by the pouch discovery the same paragraph, so causality keeps its shape.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by shimmering opal veins and looping “softly persistent” refrain; closure is a Charged Poise—beam cuts fog while Elias wears the flower, reweighting isolation into communal vigil. Cost is felt in the image: perpetual sentinel duty replacing suicide. Setup anchors who/where/when within 90 words; transitions are interior memory shards, cleanly legible. No causal turns required under this lens; the cadence shift (dawn after twilight) tightens the stake once—exactly sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: chip arrival → spiral match → caliper proof → ant trail → doorway → renounce isolation. The 110-word mark already gives who/where/when and orients cleanly; creek clock tightens throughout. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: “maps now shared, not sold,” cost paid by chip’s spent glow and flood-drenched clothes. Minor seam: “visions cascaded” paragraph summarizes the epiphany; dramatizing one rejected life-path would have lifted higher.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she is hollowed by courtly poison, therefore she climbs; because she climbs, she meets the grotto’s offer and takes it. The bleeding starlight is both literal pool and dynastic curse—tight conceptual linkage. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure lands with visible cost: “power woven in menace as fine as lace” forecloses her former self; the lens never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the glowing columella curl—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the spiral’s intensified glow is the visible cost. Causality is internal but coherent: Lirien’s return + whisper drives the alchemy, no outside cheats. Orientation is clean by line 10; the ember nexus and twilight are anchored immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the grave flips from terminus to rebirth marker under the Accumulative/Textural lens, cost felt in the dawn-lit folding of the scroll and the literal splintering of the cabin roof. Causality holds because every uplift is triggered by the jealousy method previously seeded. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors arrive by line 3. One of the cleanest 800-word lifts I’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, drip, screw pattern tightens toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors—who/where/when—land within 30 words; no penalty. The clamp-screw discovery is the single meaningful intensifier; it reconfigures the clock’s meaning and Elara’s stance without external antagonist. Closure cost is legible: she seals the screw inside the clock, creating a permanent “paused” relic—an earned stasis that forecloses sterile restoration and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: childhood superstition (crow quill) → experimental rune ink → scar-shedding ritual → earned guild re-entry. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible price: crystal shards re-cast as flexible “narrative threads” that still glow, a permanent, wearable reminder. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3; spatial logic of floating platform remains coherent. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bottle’s dissolution reconfigures both their shared past and her future column in one crackling image. Causal lens holds throughout—because she uncorks, therefore currents arc, therefore Theo coalesces enough to nod. Cost is visible—shattered glass, scorched paper, perfume lung-burn—paid on the final line. No orientation debt; archive/orchard anchors arrive by line 5 and tighten, not slacken, toward the saws’ growl.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural: spiral entries, shelf walking, and repeated hush layers tighten the same stake—illusion vs unity—until the dictionary dissolves. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cosmos “breathed as one,” reweighting every prior image. Cost is palpable (loss of the physical key, transformation of witness). Minor scaffold: three “resounding hush” hits in closing paragraph; does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s backward count projects holographic horizons, then yields to a steadied real horizon—conceptual cost legible as he forfeits certainty for custodianship. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fjord quiet / razor edges / backward count tightens meaning until final image reweights all prior ticks. Causality intact: whistle → dismissal → key → reversed flow → revelation → acceptance. No telegraphing or soft reset; cost remains in the dulled key and restored logs.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean CR: the final image—“night yielding to reluctant day”—re-weights the premise that surrender equals sight, with conceptual cost (she abandons wall-based defense). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: spore-density and beam refractions accumulate until the pattern break (rat scatter) crystallizes the new rule. Causality holds: luciferin → permeability → algorithm pivot. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the farm’s luminous veil now doubles as both sensor and blind spot—she leaves carrying that paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative lens holds: graffiti riddles thicken the texture of chance until the final archive reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by sentence three; the single transition (train → secret wing) is cued by "mica gleams where shadows pool," and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the candle’s dying glow re-frames the father’s paradoxes as publishable data rather than inherited doom. Cost is unmistakable in the cooled mica pane—a quiet, felt forfeiture of pure rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elias polishes the disc while the next call rings, crystallizing the endless cycle with felt cost. The causal lens holds: each hang-up is a deliberate therefore that narrows Mira’s options and reweights the stake. The price—perpetual solitude—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cumulative/Textural lens holds: each ingredient layers density until the ink climax reconfigures the covenant. Closure (spectral reappearance, inscription) pays off the steep pattern with felt cost—he fades, she walks on alone. Orientation is anchored by “twilight…blooming jetty” within 20 words; no teleport errors.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the community’s new rhythm is crystallized, Elias’s mask softens, and the rock’s conceptual cost is felt. Causal chain holds—rumor seed → arrival → reciprocity spiral—though the “improbable rumor” mechanics are off-page, slightly thinning motivation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (“stories change” dusk) and paid off in dawn reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ultrasonic pulse, note-cluster, and ring vibration layers density until the mirror-cleared clearing reframes all prior vibration into silence. Causality is atmospheric—because he keeps absorbing, therefore the internal map reweights—but the final image of constellations resuming shift crystallizes the cost (his lover’s face resolves). No orientation debt; anchor (blind mapmaker, night forest, star-pause) is taught by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the stillpoint reconfigures meaning without tidy epiphany, and the price—ring removed, maps now knowingly incomplete—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the nib “ready for histories yet to bend” makes the new rule—end contingent editing with moral freight—undeniable. Causal lens holds throughout: every edit node (“if stable isotopes…then”) is tested on-screen and paid for by immediate physical feedback in the anomaly. Cost is persistent: the anomaly lingers at the edge, a living reminder that each future stroke may re-open chaos. No causal or spatial disorientation past the 120-word mark; who/where/when anchored by “orbital habitat” and “drifted upward stones” inside the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence-as-material accrues density until the camera-framed hush reweights the festival; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Finn is “remembered… by the bittersweet song” with undeniable social cost; causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flame/scroll sculpture crystallizes her new stance—guardian of knowledge, torch-bearer of memory—with the vault’s intact scrolls as undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each artwork adds density until the final tapestry reweights the premise. Causality holds: arson → underground trail → vault; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“deep underground where no grid could reach”).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each drumming tap densifies the garden’s sonic field until the lagoon’s auric water reweights the stake—freedom forged from sorrow. Closure is a Charged Poise: underwater embrace, harness dissolved, handlers’ alarms scattered by surface drumming—cost is the garden’s wilting above them, a live constraint. Orientation is taught lyrically early (“vibrations bloomed into iridescent petals”) and holds; no causal breaks. The final image crystallizes options: entangled yet whole, rhythm enduring—undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: storm scramble → paper map reliance → whisper tactic → coin pattern recognition → Heart opened by aligned constellations. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Harlan’s maps surrendered, Elias’s rule affirmed. One minor lapse: the “gravitational shift” line explains rather than dramatizes the lock, but it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shutter configuration adds luminous density until starlight re-weights the void. Orientation anchored by line 3 (cobalt dock, post-rain night), no drift. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: final galaxy-spiral pattern projects undeniable cost—Elara’s spent focus, Umbra’s softened silhouette—without need of spoken epiphany. Cost is legible in the hush that follows, mirrored perfectly in the now-still puddles.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn town is unchanged outwardly, yet the invisible lattice of doubt has shifted—felt cost is legible in Elias’s tighter grip on the rook and the guards’ cracked certainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each window display adds a tile to a mosaic until the pattern reweights social reality. Because/therefore linkage is loose but coherent under this design. One minor orientation debt: “the hush where past meets prophecy” is atmospheric but not timed on a visible clock, so the exact moment is abstract; however, the final image still reconfigures stakes, so the cap is not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: scrimshaw touch → truth → skiff detachment → mer reveal, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vanishing-island dive crystallizes freedom with undeniable cost—dock life foreclosed. Orientation clean by 60 words. The mer reveal is a late rule-add; no earlier hint of physiological constraint, so the Decisive Change is slightly unmoored. Cost is felt in the rope-crack and receding docks, but the body-change lacks prior price, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the new talisman in her hand reweights the rule-set—she can keep carving hollow artifacts forever, cost now legible as eternal void. Accumulative lens holds: each shaven curl thickens the emotional density until the final image crystallizes the stake. Turbine hum + bouquet + blade pattern is taught by 25 % and recurs to tighten. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the boundary dissolves and the poet emerges “forever changed,” lake now “a mirror of skies.” Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each paraphrased line incrementally liquefies quartz → lake → realm. Orientation clear by line 4; pattern is taught early (paraphrase as key) and paid off. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but undeniably on-page: “boundaries forever permeable.” No lens contradiction; ellipsis between beats is motivated by ritual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: every beat is linked by because/therefore logic (need Mira awake → decode plants → fetch reed → climb → imperfect offer). The phoenix’s acceptance is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Elias’s “sight” remains absent, sealing the thematic bargain. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure image recharges earlier motifs of cracked glaze and shared imperfection, meeting cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each chamber thickens the sonic weave, pattern-break at Apex Chamber reweights the stake from “restore sound” to “accept disconnection as forge.” Closure—Earned Stasis—lands when she kneels in the coal-dust grit she herself created; the cost is the irreversible roughening of the weave she sought to smooth. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. One scaffold: “powerfully gentle” recurs four times without new inflection, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Driven by Accumulative/Textural logic, each origami placement layers density until the final nebula bloom re-prices the entire premise: grief can become generative fertilizer for cosmic renewal. Orientation is anchored by word 50; curtains, lectern, and lantern form an unbroken spatial triangle. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “eternity’s jewelry” reweights the widow’s craft from personal trinket to cosmic husbandry, the cost her eternal itinerancy inside timeless domes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pair reverse-engineer the crash map and inherit a communal warning duty—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (“the map reborn in onyx and measure”). Causal chain is tight: letter arrival → method revealed → path multiplication → new pattern found. Orientation is complete by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The measuring tape and ink cards act as persistent constraints shaping every tactical move. Only nit: off-stage grandmother does the original intellectual labor, blunting protagonist agency a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative lens holds: each ritual failure adds density until the pattern-break triggers closure. The final image (saffron threads in rainbow light) reweights the premise, but the pagoda’s rule-set is revealed late, so the Conceptual Repricing is resonant yet lightly prepared; cost is felt yet not persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked stone and part-ethereal guardian reconfigure the library’s future, the cost legible in her luminous regret. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—orb deterioration and ritual response—but the “comparison archive” is introduced late and functions as off-stage backstory rather than a visible tactic that shapes her choices. The midpoint transition from noticing to ritual is smooth, yet the external antagonist (shadow) remains a diffuse entity whose threat is asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the velvet pouch moment reconfigures trust into guarded regeneration, cost legible in the partial tail. Accumulative lens holds: each misted star, each peeled scale, thickens the texture until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“after the con was revealed”) and the continuous workshop space. No causal break, though the single-scene default is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letters re-price every scar she clawed open, making the cost of her tunneling undeniable. The causal chain—anesthesia → telepathic ivy cue → coffee-ring omen → dig → parental lie—tightens without ellipsis gaps. Orientation is swift; “quiet tower at dawn” anchors by line 3. Lens is Causal; each because/therefore beat narrows her options until the final reveal reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara pockets the fragment, projector light fuses past into present, cost is the forever-half-presence of her fiancé alongside Tom/Eliza. Causal chain holds—because she reads the strip → therefore finds box → therefore redefines storage of love. Orientation anchors by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn (love migrates) tightens stakes. Persistent constraint: the booth’s angles will keep incubating ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    A valid Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor traces thicken into pattern, then collapse into sleep that reweights creativity. Closure is a Charged Poise—stardust “awoke, remembered, unbound”—but the cost (body ache, calendar blur) is asserted in summary, not imaged in the final beat, so the repricing is legible yet not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chess-clock thaw and “sparks in his freighted soul” reweight his vocation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—images of glow, bloom, and wave-function lullaby accumulate until the dune itself lulls. Causality is loose; the clock’s hum triggers purpose, but no beat shows why he yields. Orientation is lyrically deferred yet ultimately functional; still, spatial anchors (“here on the dune”) remain skeletal.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corewheel’s golden sap baptizes Elias, reweighting the premise—miracles are now “probable pulse.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tree-species lament adds density until the final gust reconfigures meaning. Causality remains intact because the gear’s insertion is the direct trigger of the inward translocation. Cost is legible in the fused gear and the permanent loss of skeptical distance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara stamps the pool and reclaims her own courage with visible cost (tears, trembling). Accumulative lens holds—each star punch thickens pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is swift; fog and tide serve the disorientation that later pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: bolt discovery → flashback reveal → silent confrontation → Elias elects to remain, accepting perpetual moral chill. Orientation lands by line 15; cobalt fortress/nerve-regen window anchored. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the handshake around the bolt crystallizes their shared, unpaid cost; no cheap absolution is offered. Reflection stays under 20% and is cue-anchored to the stained banister; it alters Elias’s present choice, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the rune-laden book arrives at coronation, sundering the pretender’s claim without blood. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each inscribed book deepens the pattern until the final pellet detonates truth. The lens holds; drift’s cost is the library’s eternal pause—Lirion remains snared, victory tasted only at distance. One scaffold loop—“graceful collapse” repeated—barely dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the torn atlas becomes proof that vanished shipping lanes can re-emerge, re-weighting twenty years of grief into cyclic hope; the price is the exposure of Elias’s solitary witness life to global scrutiny. Causal chain holds: because reefs died → gyres destabilized → lanes vanished; because nascent corals return → new lanes birth → atlas gains future value. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + hologram assembly accumulates meaning until the final image reconfigures stakes. No orientation debt; station, time, and POV are anchored by word 90.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands: the opera glasses convert stone-circle hum into rebel beacon, a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her private vision becomes public target. Causal chain, however, is thin: why does she place palms on the slab, why does the hum need amplification, why do distant fighters instantly trust an untraceable signal? Orientation is fine (who/where anchored by line 3), but the lens stays lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: plant-whisper → kite decode → amber immersion → hybrid sapling, each step narrowing options. Triple-moon rite and geothermal crack land a visible, resonant change with conceptual cost—tradition rewritten in scalding water—satisfying closure under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph is re-weighted from shrapnel-of-memory to keepsake-of-endurance, and this reconfigures Elena’s future stance with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of freeze-thaw-pearl images tightens across three beats, each re-cueing the arboretum’s vegetal resilience; final beam-sweep crystallizes the re-priced meaning without contradiction. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words (who=Elena, where=seaside arboretum, when=post-automated-lighthouse era), so no penalty. One micro-turn—photo find— suffices; escalation is density-based, narrowing the stake from mere survival to grounded optimism, with price legible in the shared photo and lighthouse beam.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: because patron rejects → therefore artist seeks library → because threads are untangled → therefore loom re-weaves his sight. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias emerges carrying the mended box: the cost is the glowing scar of transformation, foreclosing return to his old fragmenting gaze. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lighthouse/library anchors are immediate. One minor causality bump: the loom’s sudden existence feels lightly unmotivated, but the closure image still reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink rewrites reality, forcing Elowen to accept that his time-dilation is evolutionary, not mystical. Cost is legible in the prismatic fracture of his body and the vanished drone dust. Causal lens holds throughout—every ink appearance is a because/therefore trigger that narrows escape routes. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: glitch → decision → transmission → cascade. The orientation anchor (“Snow entombed the Vault Library…”) arrives by line 4, waiving any debt. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s quiet smile under “alive” snow—whose cost is the certainty of future retaliation. One causal gap: how she alone can override cryo-network safeguards is asserted, not seeded, but the breach is small enough not to break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: tower fall → breach → looters → pollen defense, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (glass dome, desert, Jax gone). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses violence, pays with perpetual vulnerability—roses now marked, dagger forever sheathed. Cost is legible in the final image of etched petals and Jax’s softened grimace.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the phial-capture crystallizes options—he owns the echo but hears “greater catches,” re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: because he stays silent, therefore the echo loops in; because he pockets rather than proclaims, the hunt resets. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening at the celestial fracture beat escalates stakes without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: journalist call → drive to observatory → ledger confrontation → contradiction exposed → Thorne confesses; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (Thorne’s shame, Elara’s legacy pivot). Orientation anchored by word 60; chronology inversion is flagged and paid off; no prop teleport or knowledge cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tattooed firmware-map reweights his life’s work and guilt. Causal chain—letters → amber → slot → self-inking—never breaks; time-fold obeys taught pattern. Cost is unmistakable: he forever carries the translated haunt. Dock 0.3 for slightly late spatial anchor of the oak desk within the lab.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emergent hush physically silences the cavern, visually repricing the stakes with undeniable social cost. The tile flake, seeded early, pays off by powering the final amplification; scattering the mandala crystallizes options—unity is momentary, re-creation perpetual. Causality is intact; every turn emerges from Elara’s sand/artifact manipulation. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no drift, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: tessera-touch → vision → rename → plaza shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient plaza”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rename ripples outward and the sky fissures dim—an undeniable before/after legible to all. Closure lands on-page (“aberrant mercy reigned”) with conceptual cost: Kaelon must live inside his reclaimed compassion; Elara’s curse loosens but is not erased, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tarot-coin pickup at ~180 words cleanly triggers the ghost encounter, satisfying causality under a Causal lens; closure (Elena exits under dawn, timelines “mended”) lands with visible cost—the garden’s secrecy and her perpetual debt to Reginald. One soft spot: the orchard’s physics-rules (fruits ripening “impossibly”) are taught only at spectacle level; because they don’t constrain her final choice, the miracle feels convenient rather than priced. Orientation is secure by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal spine is clear—static shock → devise test → blind exposure → shared marker—but the closure’s “pathways are real” lands as declaration, not Decisive Change with visible cost. The lens stays causal, yet the final beat skips the because/therefore proof: we’re told the willow image mirrors her hidden memory, not shown how that forecloses doubt. The recall scandal and pill backstory tighten stakes early, but their payoff is thematic assertion, not tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: fossil surrendered, thermal orbs drift seaward, Lira’s voice lingers as “eternal sensory cartographer.” The image reweights the premise—maps now float untethered, knowledge forever partial. Causal chain intact: fossil induction → buoyant float → relinquishment → legacy of floating maps. One micro-turn mid-float tightens stakes without rupturing lens. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she trades certainty for oracular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the reversed hourglass and corked jar reweight the prophecy rule-set, making cliff-future a live choice, not sealed doom; the cost is felt in Elias’s tremble and the warehouse’s exhale. Causal linkage holds throughout: because he catalogs buttons, the echo clarifies; therefore he reverses the sand, loosening fate. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no disorientation waives penalty. Lens is causal and intact at summit turnaround.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: pillbox → snow codes → rook rendezvous → vouchsafe burst. Closure is Charged Poise—Elias re-weights Lena’s future while foreclosing his own. Orientation anchored within 120 words; only micro-slippage is “Prudently daring” refrain that occasionally overlays the same beat. Cost feels real: the empty box handed off is the visible forfeiture, cyanide implied.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the tapestry’s distilled essence reweights every prior layer and forecloses further revision; cost is felt in the “silence bloomed” beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stitch adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and causality is internal but coherent. No artifact touches the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pot’s form makes the rule “kindness folds ruin around compassion” undeniable. Causal chain holds—lantern glass → fractured visions → sun-pattern navigation → clay vessel—but the tightening beat is single; no secondary reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final image, though lightly theoretical rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the harbor’s moonlit surface and the oar-stroke cadence deepen the stake (“measure depth before turning the key”) until the gauge transfer reweights Mira’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the skiff glides shore-ward while moonlight chases shadows from Mira’s face—conceptual cost legible, no soft reset. One transition (fire-escape → dock) is cleanly anchored; Orientation Test waived because disorientation never occurs. No causal reversal is required under this lens; the final image crystallizes possibility without forcing a neat catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the decisive shift from isolated guardian to sovereign archivist with atomic spectres as mentors is reweighted by the Charged Poise image of wings catching sundial gleam—cost is the perpetual solitude she accepts. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hum thickens the density of ghost-lattices until the final cadence shifts. Causality is soft—why today breaks the cycle is unstated—but pattern coherence and tonal payoff waive the gap. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spirals lock, Theo appears, Elara’s anonymity dissolves, reconfiguring stakes with undeniable social/emotional cost. Causal linkage is loose—Theo’s arrival is coincidence—but the accumulative pattern (letters, spirals, birds) teaches lyric reunification, so lens holds. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors clear by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because she maps the tricksters’ subsonic pattern → therefore she weaponizes the same frequency against them → therefore the crowd blinks, Harlan slumps. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “cautiously hopeful” stance crystallizes while the tower looms as persistent constraint. Cost is legible—“the weight of stars a gritty comfort”—and forecloses rest. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: compass find → organ chord → spatial mutiny → transfix → key. Orientation lands by line 5; the seam-stake closure is visible. Yet the “vital key” payoff is introduced only at the end, so the stakes’ cost feels retrofitted; the lens holds but the final constraint isn’t foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: ribbon find → blood daub → dual-mask insight → portrait → confession, each because/therefore link narrows options. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) reweights the ribbon from relic to unified truth with undeniable social cost (station portrait, diver ascent). Orientation anchored by 120 words. One micro-soft spot: evidence theft offstage, but later paid on-page by Lance’s attic trophy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: salvaged journals → decoded stanzas → nail unlocks suppressed logs → transmission reverses exile, each step a because/therefore. Closure lands on-page: guild affirmations flicker while fog mocks the triumph, a Conceptual Repricing that honor is restored yet weather chaos persists. Cost is felt: Hale’s confession oozes, station dread lingers, Elara’s knees still quiver. One micro-turn suffices; no causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical recurrence (“luminous disbelief”, scaffold flutters) layers density until the final note reweights the stake—he will walk the hidden trail tomorrow. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fiddle holds silence, cost = risk of new loss. Causality is impressionistic but coherent; each image is a because/therefore of mood. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the flake→map→song chain tightens once, satisfying escalation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dusk-to-dusk mood loops, currency-as-texture, and painted hoops that glow again at the end. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias alone under starlight—reconfiguring the stake from profit to guardianship, with conceptual cost (perpetual exile in the ruins). The final image satisfies the RR test, but the middle sags into montage-like “and-then” sequencing that weakens the density build.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the solstice prophecy reweights every prior star-pulse and inscription curve, felt cost in Lyra’s lifted tears and Thorne’s depleted gasp.  Causal chain holds: telegram → dream → seventh-pulse discovery → temple confirmation, each because/therefore link tightening options.  Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Ebon Peak cliffs”).  No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (dream-maps) and paid off in dawn image.  Could nudge 9.0 if the telegram’s flower had later physical consequence instead of symbolic echo alone.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: failed spell → sucked into vortex → seed counters spiral → blood feeds plant → ice shard melts → confession released. Each because/therefore link trims options until the final shard-break costs him his self-myth. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“tumbled through a rift”). Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: “unguarded soul” stated while he bleeds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    Causal chain collapses into dream-logic montage: clipping-prick → hologram → spirit-release → covenant restored, each leap asserted rather than earned. No intermediate obstacle or micro-choice narrows options; the maze key is introduced and spent in the same paragraph. Closure is a declarative “eclipse lifted” without visible price to Elara or the world—no rule change, no path foreclosed. The lens starts causal but slips into accumulative spectacle that never tightens, only intensifies adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: card-find → ritual → blood seal → cracked destiny; escalation tightens exactly once via the price of flooded memories. Closure lands as a Charged Poise (resonant reconfiguration): roots “pulsing with new life” reweight future options while the cost—“shadows…whispering” and her “dimmed” future—remains legible. Some causality is implied rather than dramatised (swap mechanism asserted not tested) so it stops just short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the twin scraps braided in his pocket re-weight his future under a Charged Poise—he drives toward a memorial exhibit, foreclosing self-exile. Causality holds: every beat flows from the quarry find → appraisal ritual → decision to act. The reflective blocks are anchored to the cloth and timed to micro-choices (sketching the certificate), satisfying the BRR exception. A hairline slip: the TV-auction failure is mentioned before quarry orientation, a 30-word delay that barely nudges the Orientation Test waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: a lyric pattern of analogies (seed = spirit = flux lines) that thickens toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands—Elias whispers gratitude while the arbor stabilizes—so a Resonant Reconfiguration is achieved with conceptual cost (wonder remains “at touching distance”). However, the orientation anchor arrives late (~140 words) and the pattern is not taught early enough to waive the penalty; causality between seed-planting and field-stabilization is asserted, not shown, weakening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the smelted orb re-enters Elara, reweighting identity forever. The cost is felt—“maps unfurled… alive with possibility amid routine tides”—routine itself is now freighted with risk. Causal lens holds: acceptance → alchemical melt → migration. No orientation debt; domes/ tides/ gears are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s insertion dissolves physical and metaphysical walls, reweighting the bunker from tomb to nexus under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but traceable—shell → confessions → pearl → crown → permeable seals—each beat accumulates density until the final cadence shift. Cost is unmistakable: Epsilon-7 can no longer serve as airtight refuge; inspector has traded certainty for connection. No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern taught early by crystal “breathing” pays off in permeable facets.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the accordion’s clearer jig and the decision to map “internal torrents” reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost—the apprentice’s death remains, but the graffiti palimpsest reframes sole blame into shared river agency. Causal chain holds: antipsychotic cessation → sensory sharpening → graffiti deciphering → self-forgiveness reframing. One minor loop—“daringly methodical” repeated twice in opening—doesn’t touch the final image. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the patched bellows Elias now carries out.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: each beat (stain vision → ivy urging → violin play) tightens options until empire is redefined, not refused. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the observatory rooted in living vines images her fused fate, cost felt in the dawn-timed crescendo. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) planted by line 3. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (auroral hum, static crackle, emerald helix) thickens until the final dual infusion reweights the stake. Orientation is crystal by line 4; space, POV, and timeline never wobble. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grotto trembles, the chip hangs like a newborn star, and Lirien’s renewed vigil is the visible cost—oblivion forestalled, not defeated. One hairline slip: the line “motivation burning fierce” tells us the stake we already see.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: every beat is “because therefore” linked—hairpin discovery → vision → scallop → grove rebirth—so the chain tightens once and lands with undeniable conceptual cost in the final sap-bright image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scalloped petal visibly reweights the cycle rule-set, making contentment inseparable from perpetual loss/return. The kin’s exile is recounted not dramatized, a minor ellipsis that does not break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands: Elara grasps that vanishing precedes youth, a Charged-Poise reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative (ripple pattern reweights stakes) rather than strict because/therefore; lens holds. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words). Only gap: the grotto’s magnetic pull is declared, not demonstrated, so the final image feels slightly floated rather than anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each skimmed stone layers dust, birds, and echo into a density that finally reweights the stake—motionless navigation achieved. Closure is a Charged Poise: the colossal flock mirrors the arrowhead spirals, then scatters, leaving Thren fossilized yet unbound; cost is the irreversible forfeit of corporeal motion. Orientation is taught early (“In the canyon…”) and anchors hold through centuries without drift. No causality break; the wandering pulse’s transfer is the inevitable crescendo of iterated harmonics.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the Artificers fail, Thorne is sent; because he unstraps, magic stirs; because he mist-walks, he can seize the keystone—each because/therefore narrows options and raises cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: he stands at the spire lip, keystone blazing, path foreclosed yet world reconfigured—automation’s reign dented. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 40; no ambiguity or mis-taught pattern. Felt cost: perpetual twilight exile, body trembling from unstrapping, social identity as “maintenance man” annihilated.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure image (paired lantern release) is present and tonally resonant, yet the Decisive Change is soft: the reunion is magically bestowed, not seized through a costly last-fork choice. Causal chain frays when the spectral librarian hands him the color-sound answer and Lira re-materializes without Elias having to risk or forfeit anything on-page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; location and ritual time are anchored. Drive lens is Accumulative: pattern of ascending lanterns and glowing script layers density until final glow, but the lack of a tightening trade-off keeps the reweighting mild.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon beam crystallizes her stance and reweights the contracted universe with undeniable conceptual cost—expansion is prelude because she paid with existential forfeiture. Causal linkage holds: each coin-cast is a because/therefore gate that chooses which static burst she risks sanity to reverse-distill. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“ambered observatory deck…after the universe’s brutal contraction”) so the -0.3 cap is waived. The lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the behemoth "Vorath" crystallizes at the instant Elowen accepts unredemptive oblivion, reconfiguring her stance from victim to armed archivist of fear. The causal chain is airtight—wax-cylinder phrases → scattered-light refraction → ink-to-crystal transmutation—each step a because/therefore linkage under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is irrefutable: Lirian’s phantom laugh is last heard dissolving into the named monsters, a sonic sacrifice that stays alive inside the atlas. No orientation drift; who/where/when land by line 4 and the dome’s acoustic properties pay off in the final echo.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s “perfectly pitched” toll reweights the cosmic metronome, lifting the cost from Elowen’s drained body onto the rebalanced stars. Causal linkage holds: drip-rate chaos → bell fracture → mage’s drip-sync repair → restored equilibrium, each beat a because/therefore step. The 90-word orientation gives who/where/when and teaches the drip-rule that pays off at closure; no orientation debt. The single tightening—oil surge that cracks the bell wider—narrows options to precision or failure, with visible price: his devotion’s “brittle” edge snaps into exhausted certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ashes scattered over the reservoir reweight the entire premise—memory can be honored only by letting it drift, not by display. Causal lattice holds: drought → exposed town → photo trail → buried memory → confession → ritual burning → shared narrative custody. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each photograph adds density until the pattern ruptures with the self-image; the final image of “healed waters” reconfigures meaning under that same lens. Cost is on-page and persistent: the sapphire label leaves Elias’s possession, a concrete forfeiture that will shape every future patrol. Orientation anchor (“who/where/when”) is taught by word 30 and never loosens. No teleporting props; the lantern that burns the photos is the same lantern adjusted in paragraph 1. Mosaic shard count is two (levee patrol → overlook burning) with a clean temporal splice; transitions legible under 15% of text. Meets 9+ gate without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard is anchored by ~80 words; the waterfall’s prism and pulsing roots teach the surreal logic early, so Orientation Test is waived. Causality is rhythmic, not linear: each sensory layer (crystal warming, bird patterns) deepens the stake rather than triggers a new plot branch. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options reconfigured when the steam braids through the dispersing flock—cost felt in the same breath that harmonizes her. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern holds to the final exhale of the leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: Elias keeps the sky, forfeits ground connection, and the cost is visible in the single sentence “He refastened his parachute buckle, fingers lingering on the revised tension.” Causal chain is clean—radio alert → pattern anomaly → buckle protocol → vector shift → safe landing; each because/therefore tightens options. The buckle revision invented mid-call becomes doctrine, a persistent constraint that re-orders future jumps. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and pay off in the final arbor vigil image.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Kai’s numbness shatters on-page when palms touch, cost paid in blood and the forever-split/shared identity. Causal lens holds throughout: because he is void, therefore he can vivify via complementary opposite; each Blade slash tightens options until only fusion remains. Orientation anchor—“floating rock dojo amid swirling temporal vortices”—arrives by line 3; no penalty. No meaningful accumulation or situational pattern, so judged under Causal default; no lens ambiguity. The price (shared existence, Collective antagonism unresolved) persists into the final image, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: seed arrival → Braille-map suspicion → UV-ink reveal → legal armour grant. Each pivot is logically triggered by tactile discovery, not author sleight. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the seed becomes “his finest room yet,” reweighting threat into opportunity with visible gain (flash-drive files). Minor slack: the “Genoa postmark yet no customs stamp” clue is dropped but never causally resolved, leaving a tiny teleporting-info burr.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural arc is coherent: wind & lullaby layers intensify density until laughter blooms. Closure is a Charged Poise—blowers sputter, household fades contentedly, Elias left in charged silence—felt cost is legible. Transitions are smooth within the single tunnel scene; spatial anchors (alcoves, table) are clear by 120 w. One causality hiccup: “macerate” is declared effective rather than shown altering ghost physiology; still, laughter’s return is tied to gust crescendo, satisfying the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the garden folds into the guardian’s being and a portal home yawns—visible cost is the frozen garden now grafted inside the body. Causality, however, is lyric rather than tight: “uncertainty yields paths” is poetic fiat; the pendant flares because the text needs a portal, not because its rules were foreshadowed. Accum/Textural lens holds—density and image-pattern reweight the stake—so the ending is legible, but the missing because-chain keeps it shy of 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a bright Conceptual Repricing: the pulverized crozier ignites into a living tree that thaws the nexus and “shatters his stifling fate,” visible cost legible in the final image. Causal linkage is present—each failed approximation teaches a destructive insight—yet the pivot to “total creative destruction” is asserted in summary rather than shown as a pressured decision moment. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by line 3); the ember nexus stays spatially coherent. The lens is Hybrid: accumulative pattern (repetitive trials) tipped by a final causal leap; the pattern is taught but the decisive beat is rushed, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s silence is repriced as intentional dormancy, and Elara’s cost—abandoning her own creed of finality—lands in the final image. Causal chain (perigee → overload → discard assumptions → new amplifier revealed) holds without gaps; no teleporting props. Orientation is clean by line 8; the one-line orientation debt waiver is not triggered. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Persistent constraint (cables could snap) shapes every tactical move, meeting the 9+ cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain holds: sideways clock → grotto → fading hull → hourglass → radio fix → timeline merge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias pockets the empty hourglass, accepting permanent transient existence—cost is conceptual but legible. However, the grotto rules, hourglass mechanics, and pattern-radio method are declared mid-stream rather than seeded, so the resolution feels ex-machina even though emotionally coherent. Orientation is clear by word 60, no teleporting props; one causal micro-hole—how empty glass suddenly flows is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating pattern-weaving tightens the stake until the tapestry detonates, reconfiguring illusions into visceral bonds with undeniable cost (“arterial spray frozen in time”). Orientation is immediate; the gallery anchors who/where inside 40 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias stands newly textured, options rewritten, calm now laced with grit.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: relic → geometry lesson → virtual rift. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Kai departs with talisman and new knowledge—yet the cost is only Elara’s hinted melancholy, not dramatized on Kai, so the “before/after” feels mild.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece lands a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara chooses life after hearing the relayed assurance—so closure formally exists, but the cost is felt only by Clara; Elara’s stake evaporates. Causality under the inferred Accumulative lens is loose: the hearing-aid pulses merely appear, never constrain tactics, and their quietus is unearned. Orientation is clean within 120 words, yet the single-scene default is stretched by repetitious mist-and-hush lines that stall rather than tighten. Because Elara neither pays nor forecloses anything, the closure lacks the required visible price under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is tight: slack tide window → cave descent → codex activation → phase transition → surfacing with closure. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the phase mechanic is seeded early via logs and pays off in the ghost-stabilization climax. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she carries their witness and a persistent ethereal tinge (“codex held faint glows”). Cost is felt but could be sharper—no concrete forfeiture beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: clerical death → midnight refuge → radio voice → ink-cipher → shard anchor → reintegrated identity. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “survival was no error, but a heartbeat’s defiant song” reweights the premise with felt cost. One minor drag: the ink-method arrives ~20 words late for optimal teaching, but pattern pays off in the defragmentation beat. Orientation is clean; who-where-when and speculative rules established early and never contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: because language dies → Thorne seeks echo-tunnel → uses cursed diamond → risks madness → converts bird-pattern into sonic lattice → preserves tongue. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; single transition (years blur) is legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: the tunnel now permanently contains the language; cost is the flock’s dispersal and Thorne’s spent glow—felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arrowhead→phone→confession→levitation chain is cleanly causal under a Causal lens; each object triggers the next beat. Closure is a Decisive Change: weight lost, underground garden left, bitterness transmuted; cost is the palm-embedded flint that literalizes “punchline etched in starlight.” Orientation is secure by line 20 (“frost-rimed earth… underground garden”). No persistent constraint reverberates post-ascent, keeping the cost gorgeous but momentary; that caps the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: patrol pattern knowledge → heart-rhythm signal → split bark → uproot → statues freeze. Closure lands with visible cost—shell cracks, metal roots tear free, her violin “weeping triumph” recharges the opening motif. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 30; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (shell’s fragility) shapes the final gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: empty slots → map of fractures → drone launch → storm-breath masking border dash → letter from Expanse. One shard (booth interior) contains all turns; transitions are legible via the slot-to-slot logic taught early. Closure is a Decisive Change: Elias pivots from anonymous savior to self-redeemer, cost legible in half-drained vial and heavier heart. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate twilight haze pays off when the same bruise-purple light frames the final pedal away.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored carousel glows while Elias walks away, carrying the fragment’s whispered futures—cost is the irrevocable split between maker and miracle. Causal chain holds: wrong turn → oasis → fragment → silent song → renunciation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (misting hush lifting at dawn) reweights stakes. One hairline scaffold—“quietly persistent” repeated in adjacent sentences—stops short of true flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the scarf half-open, the library holding its breath, Eliza’s promise etched on the desk—cost is the perpetual pull of an unfinished portal. Causality holds: scarf → geometry → portal shimmer → renunciation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten until the final crystallized image. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captured dream glows eternal yet weightless, re-weighting Elara’s life-library. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each sunrise session thickens pigment and stakes—though the cipher’s translation from book to camera feels a shade convenient. Orientation is swift: lighthouse-library-anchor by line 3. Final image crystallizes absence into presence; cost is the forever-ungraspable bird, felt in the hush after shutter-click.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locksmith pockets the hair, choosing continued guardianship—an Earned Stasis with visible cost signaled by “heart disoriented toward hope.” Causal chain holds: star-hint → ribbon-burn → secret unravel → talisman taken → self-exile chosen. Orientation is taught by word 60 (“shadowed nexus under starlight”), waiving penalties. Lens is Accumulative: pattern of star/knot/secret repeats and deepens meaning rather than narrows plot options.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellations re-knit, memories flood back, and the fairy ring’s fade becomes the felt cost. Causal chain holds—because he traces the star-map in the water, therefore the sprites’ bargain reverses. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One causal micro-turn suffices for 798-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Kai’s shadow rejoins him, reversing exile with visible light-rush; Elara’s cost is the next solitary scroll. Causal chain—tea geometry → sigil → release—holds. Orientation is swift; “forgotten library” and Elara’s shard-mirroring anchor by line 3. The backwards-walking tic is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the pattern waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the seed-tree erupts, color returns, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the valley’s palette. Causal chain is soft—essence-capture mechanics are asserted rather than tested—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strand added thickens the stake until the final image crystallizes the cost of guardianship. Orientation is swift; no penalties. A firmer mid-scene obstacle or pruning miscue would have tightened causality and pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sanctuary’s “murmurs of settled souls” reconfigure Lirien’s private grief into communal quiet; the stained needle in his pocket is the felt relic of that cost. Causality is cumulative-textural—each unpicked knot increases density until the final sigh disperses silence—yet the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is swift: “prism sanctuary under starlight” + “broken mask restorer” anchors who/where by line two. No teleporting props or explanatory dumps; the net, needle, and masks are tactile from first appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reframed map and exhumed letter reweight silence from absence to empathetic medium; the keystone press is the visible act that pays the entry fee. Causal chain holds—tear → footage comparison → fissure → descent—though the off-stage email is a soft hinge rather than a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shaken snow globe reweights the entire quest—Earhart frozen in eternal stasis becomes the mirror in which Elara accepts her own drift, paying with the literal loss of proof. Causal chain holds: find → decrypt → quantify → relinquish; each step tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of ascending “nothing but the next unraveling” crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s liberation arcs skyward while Elowen’s voice is forever re-tuned to be heard—cost felt in the warm plate and the thunderous applause that replaces her usual silence. Causal chain:她发现壁画→解码幽灵→ plate aligning code→ pigment transfer→ spectral release, each step tightening options. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“misty courtyard above the clouds”). Lens is Causal; every beat is “because/therefore.” No late-rule changes; thunder’s delay is set-up paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary decode累积地 reweights Lira’s identity under Accumulative/Textural lens; the moment she closes the diary and dons the goggles crystallizes a new social cost—she steps out as Elowen’s heir. Causality holds because each floor’s decryption is anchored to the scattered-light mechanic taught early; no teleporting props or knowledge leaks. Cost is legible in the final breath: “a captain’s blood in her veins,” a conceptual price that reconfigures her future service.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the origami gondola release reframes the snapped string from fatal accident to deliberate sacrifice, paying the price of eternal drift to prove “empty spaces remember.” Causal chain holds: string snap → free ascent → emotional logging → origami proxy → perpetual observatory. Cost is visible in the final image—“adrift yet whole.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of spooling/cloud-emotion layering tightens to final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of coin → fractal plan → mirror execution → sky captured, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tree falls but the sky inside persists, reweighting erasure into eternity; cost is the tree’s death and her anonymous exile. Orientation anchored by word 50 (oak grove, dawn, axes outside). No prop or knowledge teleporting; coin mechanics are pre-loaded and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: glow → cipher → coordinates → dome → ascent, each step linked by Elara’s agency. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rift-bearing now re-weights her solitude into mission, cost felt in “borrowed glow” that must be repaid. Minor scaffold appears in the three-sentence “luminance brightened…surged upward” cluster, not quite marring the image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern taught early via frost-rimed shelves and gear-clink echoes; density increases through prismatic light burst until mirrors soften to “gentle glow,” reweighting stakes from archive to living pulse. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias descends with clocks now carrying infinite reflections; cost is legible—he must live every tick knowing the source is mirrored, not original. Orientation and causality remain clean; no prop or knowledge teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bell-ringing yanks the nebula down and rewrites the orchard’s fate before our eyes, cost paid in shared labor and Lir’s dissolution. Causality is folkloric—ghost arrows → bell ritual → planetary healing—rather than psychological, but the pattern is legible and taught early. The Orientation Test is waived because the floating-arch geography is re-used to anchor the final image. One soft patch: “strangers became family” is narrated summary, not dramatized turning beat, slightly blunting the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each spiral/image repeats with added emotional density until the song’s vibration reweights the ticking silence. The pane, puppet fractures, and lullaby accumulate into a Charged Poise—the lighthouse fades but the ripple’s cost is felt—no beats break causality, all ellipsis is taught.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens dominates: each nut placement is a because/therefore link that narrows traveler options and raises Elias’s exposure; frost deadline supplies ticking pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—frost sealing the arrows crystallizes both escape path and his endless loop, cost legible in “reluctance returned, heavy as fallen fruit.” Blueprint set-up at ~100 words cleanly anchors who/where/when and later pays off; no orientation debt. No lens ambiguity; escalation is single tightening line toward frost, sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied chrysalis and clarified river reweight “divergent path” into convergent stewardship; cost is legible in the risked career and the river’s visible renewal. Causal chain—grief → foam insight → polymer reform → ecological atonement—holds without plot amnesia; the Orientation Test is passed by line 3. Minor ellipsis: we infer lab trials rather than witness them, but the jump is motivated and paid off by downstream success. Persistent constraint: his tainted legacy could still discredit the new polymer, tightening the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the slate’s fracturing map reweights the premise—absence becomes generative engine, not deficit. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each numeric incision tightens pattern until the bloom into map. Orientation is swift—who, where, stakes taught by line 5. Persistent constraint: once moonlight is spent, no reversal; the empty bottle charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal lens holds: dream-call → rain-pool → dig → pavilion → absorb → dawn-release, each beat a because/therefore linkage that tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion thaws in imperceptible drips, his step lightens, the cost (caravan forgiveness) is felt. One minor scuff: the coral’s rule (amplifies remorse) is revealed in the same beat it is solved, a late-rule hitch that nicks perfection but does not break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: starlight hush → weight drop → cable arcs → dawn bridge → polyglot summit, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same weight that once measured clock time now measures communal time, dangling at the bridge’s apex with undeniable social cost—former enemies must now literally cross the same plank. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The −0.6 non-closure cap applies for two small causal elisions (how crews suddenly possess planks; how language-switch actually alters bargaining leverage), but the final image reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror “whole in her entangled perception” reweights the premise—dreams are now portable strata. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); each tilt of the mirror accretes memory-fragments until the canyon itself is re-seen as archive. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear inside 120 words; no penalty. The cost is conceptual—she now carries collective ghosts—but the text keeps declaring “profound transformation” instead of dramatizing a single concrete forfeiture, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain: doodle → inversion → chamber → memorization → exit, each link legible; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (she exits bearing reweighted knowledge). Orientation is swift; gravity rule taught by 100-word mark. Cost is asserted (“beacon”) not dramatized—no wound, forfeiture, or even breathless fatigue—so the lens holds but the price feels notional.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove sways, birds land, sculpture vibrates—silent yet musically alive—cost is the unrepeatable moment Elowen leaves behind. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of stress-crack → note → empathy builds to cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no penalty. No plot amnesia or teleport; porcelain and sculpture states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silences accumulate into a magnetic resonance map that reweights the covenant. Closure lands in the charged image of king aligned to dent, stone warming, fields weaving—“a promise half-reclaimed”—with undeniable conceptual cost: exile unbroken, phase still coming. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the “covenant-deep quiet eclipsed by betrayal” is told more than shown, a minor causality blur that keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of silence thickens until the 432 Hz burst reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—diary open, firework exhale—cost felt in the moth-wing sigh. Causality is present but secondary; pattern taught early by starlit gadget choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each journal scrap and scent note deepens density until the midnight bloom reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: “serenity not as stillness, but poise within sway” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost—she will forever smell decay in motion. Persistent constraint: her hyperosmic nose now reads decay as wisdom, a price that will shape every future sway.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each “because” (family groves failed) drives “therefore” (invert-flight, theft of tip). The arrow’s removal triggers a clear Decisive Change—echoes wail, vines retract—paid for by the planet’s reaction and Elara’s trespass. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she gains growth but silences a living chorus, a price felt in the hush that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: wind shear → AI failure → swarm funnel → silence; each beat of the survey tightens the map that proves it. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (who, where, when) and the maze geography stays trackable. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his final transmission reframes the whole port as a living wind tunnel that must be coded into machine foresight; the cost is the perpetual vigilance now sewn to his sleeve. The only drag is a slight loop in the middle third where “rapidly adapting” is asserted more than dramatized, but it never breaks the because/therefore spine.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpted hush yields without shattering, proving wonder’s necessity while preserving the cavern’s peace. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each bell-stroke thickens chromatic density until silence itself is repriced. Orientation is swift (aurora, frost pedestal by line 4), and the final image (“crystal whisper”) carries unmistakable conceptual cost: the amber relic is spent, the guardian forever altered.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final casing of the flute is an Earned Stasis—he forsakes shame-driven guardianship for alliance-seeking wisdom, the cost legible in the crumbling markers. Causality holds under a causal lens: because the orb was lost, therefore he weaves backward, therefore he repackages vocation. Driftwood-to-flute linkage is tight; no teleporting props. Minor knocks: the “insight” beat is paraphrased, not fully dramatized, and the thief-replay is translucent exposition rather than a fresh obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore chain—fragment embedded → ink mixed → invite tendered → empathy swaps. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the new star’s math reweights the premise that emotion equals series; cost is the spent halo and Elias’s stagger. Orientation is nailed in the first sentence (“topaz workshop perched on a jagged cliff”). No causal amnesia; every object state (fragment, press, page) tracks cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s mentor-shaped absence is re-priced into living myth, felt cost is the perpetual trek alone. Causal chain holds—pendant’s sympathetic vibration is set up by Thorne’s lore and triggers Lira’s transformation, feeding back to Kael’s mythic self-reading. One minor causality fuzz: vision-sharing mechanics are asserted mid-beat rather than seeded, but the lyric pattern is taught early by aurora/time-warp motif, so lens stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the frost sentence *Feel me* reweights the entire premise—objects demand witness—paid for by Elias’s melted tear-track and the forever-changed sedan window. Causal lattice holds: prism → spectrum → frost pattern → wife’s name → denial fracture → paper draft. Orientation is nailed in first 60 words: who (Elias), where (quartz arbor), when (winter dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost speaks, narrowing options from data-collection to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tapestry lifts, Elara dissolves, and the amber bead remains—an image that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each weave thickens pattern until the final cadence shift releases the message. The Orientation Test is waived; delayed anchors serve the lyric design and payoff. One scaffold loop—“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” repeated near opening and close—slightly dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final arch lifting reweights the planet’s rule-set and the cost is the spent silk and Elar’s hidden scars. Causal chain holds—silk → binding → floating stones → stabilized orchard—but two transitions (grove → shaft → grove) are compressed into montage, so the tightening is felt more as image than as option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens: lyrical accumulative texture that tightens into causal redirect. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—shard fuses to hand, crystallizing cosmic cost. Orientation taught immediately: "abandoned spaceport repair bay," who/where clear inside 50 words. One soft patch: "worlds whispered thanks" edges toward anthropomorphic shorthand but occurs post-closure, so cost still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s note folded into the rebuilt tower crystallizes the “bottled safety” idea and forecloses his former mute stance. Causality is accumulative rather than twist-driven; each stacked stone/note is a prior beat that charges the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). The only softness is the off-stage “haunt”—never allowed to resolve the conflict, but it also never breaks the lens; pressure stays situational/accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dawn gilded by eternal night reweights the world. Causal lens holds—vision → beam tweak → shadows → coast—yet cost is atmospheric, not personal; Elias loses nothing on-stage. Orientation is swift; only one causal hinge feels thin.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fractal veins reweight the premise—beauty magnetizes stories that can devour their bearer. Causal chain holds: donor heart → magnetized tales → wing’s iridescent warning → Earned Stasis of vigilant restraint. Cost is legible in the final image—wing dimmed to “velvet blue,” threat interiorized. Lens is Accumulative; pattern taught early (stories “orbit like moths”) and paid off in charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images layer (storms, moonlight, dream-maps) until the oaks re-weight the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant zeroed, “a tool reborn to map not stars, but the subtle graces binding sky to soil”—cost is the astronomer’s erased grief. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact. Minor slip: the corridor “pin-drop” is told as a clause, not dramatized beat, softening the tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror world’s night is peeled back by woven dawn, with undeniable conceptual cost—Elara’s memories align at the price of her prior identity. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern builds through recurring songs and light-threads until cadence shifts at the Heart Tree ignition. Orientation is secure by line 4. No meaningful tightening is lost in the choral swell; the final image crystallizes options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because she once crumpled the summons → therefore she rescues the youth → therefore she redeems herself via the same portal. Each turn tightens options until the invitation disintegrates, sealing her vow. Closure is a Charged Poise: she hides in full view, cost legible in the stardust that was her last escape route. One micro-loop (“crumpled invitation” x3 in 30 words) nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through sensory returns (birds gone → bread scent → frost silver) rather than causal reversals; closure is a Charged Poise where shared bread reconfigures sibling distance. Orientation crisp by 40 words; spatial choreography across courtyard/tea-house retains legibility. One minor causality fuzz: how Elias kept a loaf oven-fresh for “months” is hand-waved, but it is a delivered miracle, not a plot cheat, so the closure cost holds. Final image of winter-pruned vine crystallizes new cooperation; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each frequency sampled layers density until the chord coalesces into a Resonant Reconfiguration—ice shelf stabilizes, frost recedes, vows re-glow. Causality is internal and recursive: measurement → pattern recognition → tonal rescue. Closure beat (“etched the chord’s equation onto ice”) carries visible cost: irreversible commitment to infinite calibration. No Orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4, lens stable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lattice is tight: each failed attempt escalates Thorne’s suspicion, narrows Lila’s options, and culminates in the fob-noose reveal that snaps the truce. The sunrise deadline is a persistent clock that compresses space for maneuver; the wax-cylinder payoff is foreshadowed by “capture that sound” and lands with conceptual cost—the market’s covenant is irreparably priced. Orientation is anchored by sensory triangulation within 60 words (“rotting pier,” “fish guts,” “swaying lanterns”). Closure is a Decisive Change: the recorded rupture becomes a circulating warning, re-weighting the region’s power ecology.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a credible Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance flips from doubt to participation, charged by the ring’s blaze and taste shift, cost felt. Causal chain holds: compass signal → descent → convergence → membership; each beat narrows her options. Orientation clean by line 8; no lens drift. Accumulation cap: two “wait, trim” meta-intrusions (−0.4) break immediacy but do not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens is declared early—he “couldn’t brute-force the lock”—and every beat obeys because/therefore logic: memory → schematic → hidden tumbler → repair → release. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the strongbox yields, creativity uncorked, laughter now free of regret. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within first 100 words; no orientation debt. One micro-turn—realizing the schematic must be drawn—tightens options under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The map-assembled quest supplies a causal spine; each stop (bazaar, farm, vault) tests the honesty-currency rule with visible bodily stakes. Closure lands cleanly: the mentor’s recorded confession is the Decisive Change, and the cost is the irreversible loss of the lie that had protected her. Orientation is anchored within the first 60 words; the drive lens (Causal) is held without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the perpetual thaw and her choice to remain silent reweight the stakes—wonder must be guarded anew each dawn. Causal chain holds: iceberg arrives → she sculpts → pilgrims come → ice keeps melting, tightening maintenance into fate. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each bell and glissando thickens the texture until the final sunset fracture reconfigures meaning. Cost is unmistakable—“the fragment thawed imperceptibly, demanding constant renewal”—a literal drip of time against eternity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: magnetic flip → memory shards → box opened → chaos merged → miniaturize & burn → static purged; closure lands with conceptual cost—“slag remnants” and “beautifully fragmented” poise—under a coherent Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: locket clue → story clues → dial code → mailbox opened; each beat advances knowledge. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Escalation is soft—pressure is collective, not personal; the mailbox release is satisfying but low-cost for Elena. Closure lands as Charged Poise: courtyard hush vs. city din, emptied mailbox now “filled by heard hearts”; social cost (exposed letters, public tears) is legible. Lens stays situational/accumulative; pattern coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: every vault progress is because/therefore tied to dice rolls → dance → AI re-activation, culminating in cryo-pod liberation. The final “rise, encrypt your scars” reweights the premise—vulnerability itself becomes the cipher—charging closure with conceptual cost. No orientation drift; sunken anchors land by line 5. Persistent constraint: the lab’s groaning hull forecloses lingering, tightening the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: embedding the heart reweights the town’s memory economy and Elias’s role, with the felt cost of permanent guardianship. Causal linkage holds: because the whale births gravity pockets, therefore Elias can reclaim memories; because he does, therefore he must protect them forever. One soft patch: the paragraph of coffee-ground divination works as pattern but reads like a inserted instruction manual; a one-line slip, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lattice holds: because the prophecy infects his dreams, therefore he maps silence; because the crane geometry channels flow, therefore hush smothers code. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 50 words; no disorientation debt. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the origami wing dematerializes, signalling that tranquil stillness now replaces cosmic noise. One minor causal fuzz: we are told worlds “collide in silent ruin” but never shown what that would tangibly mean to Elias’s haven; the threat remains abstract, keeping score just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal pressed into Elara’s palm reweights every prior tea-session lie and transforms her from eavesdropper to speaker under a meteor shower—cost is the irrevocable loss of innocence and the burden of guardianship now shared. Causal linkage holds throughout: sugar-borrow → weekly tea → rooftop interrogation → seal surrender; each step narrows Harlan’s options and widens Elara’s agency. No orientation or prop drift; the buildings’ groans evolve from background texture to responsive chorus, tightening the lens. Final image—“she spoke her first fluent phrase to the building, and it replied”—is an on-page beat that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarantine dissolves into “independence’s quiet strength,” signaled by the glow’s deliberate dimming and the shell’s new talismanic weight. Causal linkage holds throughout: because she distills the memory into the shell, therefore the quarantine evaporates and her light shifts. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each resonance gesture thickens the pattern until the cadence breaks at dawn. Cost is legible in the final line: “unchained” yet alone, a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the invisible chain snaps when the final blood-stroke dissolves the last forged edict, foreclosing any return to vengeance. Causal lens holds: each unlink is a because/therefore reversal of his prior inked treason. Orientation is swift—marble sanctuary, aurora, thorn—within 60 words. Cost is visible: reopened scarlet scar seals the rite.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene orientation is secured by line 5; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via iterative shell-whispers that intensify density. Four progressive disclosures function as because/therefore escalations: each revelation narrows the group’s trust and Elyra’s tactical options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she pockets the shell under a hush-hum, now knowing perception itself forges echo-chains—reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost (she walks alone). One causal micro-gap: the guardian’s instant stone-web ability is not pre-seeded, a hairline convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shrine hush and “borrowed starlight” fade let ghosts exhale, reconfiguring stakes without tidy victory. Causal chain (globe → dream-cameos → locket) holds; however, dream-mechanics are exposited rather than tested mid-scene, muting cost visibility. Orientation anchor (“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice”) arrives within 30 words—no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of cameo images reframes meaning; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kai sees the moon path and net as the same hidden effort, tightening his stance on creation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of froth ↔ firefly ↔ net weave reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the cooled, bitter matcha he still drinks—“bitterness a poignant reminder.” No orientation debt; geography (parapet → shore → parapet) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain locks tight: shredded letters → methodical reassembly → lattice blueprint → diamond unearth → silence, each because/therefore linkage narrowing options until the moral cost crystallizes. Orientation is swift—name, role, stakes, terrain inside 60 words—and the single scene holds without spatial drift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he reburies the gem, pockets proof, and the orchard’s calm lingers in his veins—undeniable conceptual cost paid on-page. No prop teleports; tension escalates by discovery, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is present: a Conceptual Repricing—Elias broadcasts the ultimate verse while shadows recede, revealing a bruised horizon and a unified flock—so “before” (isolated crackpot) / “after” (acclaimed prophet) is legible with social cost implied. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm imagery and radio fragments intensify pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (stormlit observatory above clouds). The weak link is motivation-to-cost on the final beat: the story tells us “he wondered” about devourer/be devoured, but offers no on-page constraint or price at that precise moment, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern taught early (jars, dunes, sounds) and closure lands via resonant reconfiguration—waltz reborn, lineage re-connected. Orientation anchored by 70 words; no penalty. Escalation is density/texture: each new jar layer sweetens the stakes until the market beat reweights meaning. Cost is conceptual (he gives away the sound of his own loneliness) and felt, though the grandmother’s grief payoff is off-stage of Elias’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because key hum → wraiths come; because console activated → marina resonance reconfigures ice and wraiths. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the largest wraith blooms into luminous petals—absolution priced as irreversible dispersal, not victory. Persistent constraint: key now thrums heartbeat-like, future guardian burden legible. Orientation and causality clean; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lattice holds: rain-slick → firm ice →可行 crossing → lunar nadir → field collapse. Closure lands with visible cost—sparks, shuddering viaduct, awakening town—under a single, coherent lens. One scaffold loop (“patience sculpted from impatience”) repeats without new pressure; else exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands: phone sparks in puddle = visible bond-break; lantern swing reweights all prior entangled imagery. Causal lens holds: each reverberation tightens options until she acts. Cost is on-page—digital leash literally dies—so RR qualifies. One micro-lapse: the artifact’s sudden psychic upload isn’t fore-shadowed, but it pays off in the final image, waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the reactivated hymn reweights Elias’s earlier refusal and charges his public vow with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—bringing the box → repair → ticking → vow—though the storm-beam trigger is a mild external contrivance. Orientation is secure within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she salvages the tip → decodes glyphs → implants algorithm → carts yearn upward, therefore fleets fly. The final image—“bell tolling eternally mute”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reprices her entire workshop as genesis barge; cost is the irreversible severance from the acid sea and the silent burden of god-making. One clean transition (sea → workshop → sky) taught early; orientation anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“nothing truly vanished”—with felt cost (job forfeiture) and the 2519 pulse reweights the premise; causal chain is crisp until the corporate-purge alarm, which appears as coincidence rather than therefore linkage, slightly denting lens purity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s shared-light map visibly reweights both factions’ options with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because she unearths the fragment, therefore she can weave empathic light—mirrors teach pattern early and pay off in the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint (the orb’s glow as living treaty) shapes the closing image, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each trawl beat thickens the sonic texture of endings until the final hush lands as Charged Poise. The parasol tip’s loss and the almost-heard sigh tighten the pattern, reweighting the stake without causal reversal. Orientation anchored by word 30; no ambiguity. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—she forsakes her old life to become witness, the sound now “etched in her bones.”

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena steps toward the sunrise carrying Theo’s reframed mismatch as personal compass; the image reweights prior stakes without tidy moral. Causal lens holds: because she misses the bus → meets Theo → parallels burn away illusion → she leaves. Orientation anchored by line 4; no penalty. One micro-turn—letter fragment switches from relic to talisman—tightens options cleanly. Cost is legible: both lovers relinquish possession of the past in the same gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers quiet images (clearings, dunes, pavilion murmurs) until the final hush certifies preservation. Causality is loose—no concrete obstacle ever endangers the rite—yet the because/therefore linkage (“lest the parapet’s motion unravel the rite → peripheral gaze → consecration”) is legible and pays off in a Charged Poise final image. Cost is present but diffuse: the walker’s blurred sight and cooled mask imply permanent perceptual shift. The orientation anchors arrive late (~150 words), but the delay is functional, teaching the reader to accept disorientation as method, so the −0.3 orientation penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living collage reweights communal memory, vines/applause literalize the cost of reclaimed space; causal chain is lyric-accumulative—each photograph arc tightens the stake—so lens holds. Orientation clear by line 3, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal holds her testimony forever, refracting past and future echoes with undeniable conceptual cost—language frozen yet potentially re-awakened. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fractured sequence tightens the pattern recognition until the lectern moment reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the single sentence she utters after years of silence and in the library’s exhalation that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the chalk-circle anchoring the captured “sound of growing older” reconfigures the entire quest; the tape-loop now ages him in real time, cost felt as “growing older with every loop.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each chalk sigil, driftwood arrow, and evaporated vision layers density until the final vibration of vinyl/bone sculpture becomes inevitable. The 120-word orientation test is met by line 6 (who/where/when anchored in “fog sculpture garden…Elias”). No lens ambiguity; pattern of forgetting→re-marking taught early and paid off in the closing image of the snapped chalk.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning hand’s surrender to lunar/leaf cadence reweights the meaning of escape velocity for both man and dome; cost is the irreversible mingling of organic and machine time. Causal lens holds: moonquake therefore deranged chronometer therefore observation at risk therefore leaf therefore micro-notches therefore ticking normal. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity; who/where anchored before 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain intact: blood-work verdict → Elara activates plan → daughter summoned → shard returned → Harlan dies at peace. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Harlan’s final smile reconfigures regret into peace while vinyl rests on his chest, a visible conceptual cost. One minor orientation ripple—Lena’s arrival is telegraphed, not blocked—but the lens (Causal) holds. No teleporting props or memory holes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: key-turn → automaton awaken → map → descent. The resonance of “closing loops” reweights the stake at the end, giving a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the isle’s approval hum seals her new burden. One soft spot—the backward-looking spoon lore is dumped in two sentences and never pressures present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: substitute body → maze entry → tooth unearthing → spirit-alignment ritual, each a because/therefore step that narrows her options to belief. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sealed pearl rewrites the rule-set—fae are real, skepticism now costs her community’s healing. Cost is legible in the cracked sundial and the linen strip she can never reuse. No orientation debt; early anchors (village brook, family estate, night) land by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard adds density until the glass’s prismatic bloom reweights the stake. Orientation is fixed by line 4 (“serpentine grotto… coastal cliffs”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the village square glows without fire, Elara’s grounded stance crystallized, her sky-longing forever foreclosed. Cost is legible—“earthbound feet steady on the damp stone”—the price of guardianship now irreversible. No causal chain is broken; pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant exchange crystallizes a new shared fragility; cost is felt in the final image (“amber glow reflecting their shared fragility”). Causal linkage holds: because Elara etched the icicle message, Kai arrives; because she proffers the heirloom, a new pact forms. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “honeyed hush” is repeated without new causal bite, but it does not touch the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nexus rules are atmospheric, not causal; the cameos appear by author fiat, not Elias’s agency. The ritual’s logic is taught early and honored at closure, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is secure by line 30. Closure is a Charged Poise: the manuscript now “alive,” reweighting earlier despair, cost felt in the warming shell. No because/therefore linkage between cameos, but pattern holds; lens ambiguity at midpoint is waived by coherent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final hush lifts into “murmurs of thanks,” a palpable social cost—village lives now orbit the revived rites. Causal chain: moon-set → song → loom spins → golden stories rain → blight retreats; each step is on-page and irreversible. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (woven platform, eastern horizon) appear by line 4. The lens is Causal; because/therefore linkage holds without ellipsis missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the dome of starlight hovers, Eira’s path reconfigured from “lost” to “ascending,” cost shown in frozen tears and trembling knees. Causal chain—plate → pattern → flash-paper ignition → dome—is airtight; no orientation debt; lens holds accumulative to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each angle-of-light trial layers density until the timer’s whir becomes the crystallised “before/after”. Orientation is swift—cavern, frost, ledge all inside 60 words—and the final image reweights the premise: the locksmith exits carrying “keys to memory’s vault,” an earned stasis that forecloses further experimentation. Cost is conceptual but legible: his own echoes are now external cargo, a quiet burden he must forever guard.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble veins, quartz seams, and phosphorescent fungi are not backdrop but instruments: their angles dictate Elias’s tactics and charge the final timer-click. Spatial choreography stays exact—ledge, fissure, nexus—so the cavern functions as both lens and crucible. The micro-setting (timer casing, glow-worm filament) tightens the last calibration, meeting the 9+ gate by constraining the decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: calcification converts infinite recursion into stone monument, visible cost in her coalesced form. Causal chain holds: lamp orientation → starlight conduit → crystallization. Orientation clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—fractals overgrow—sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each chisel cut is a because/therefore step toward containing memory, narrowing options until the locket snap forecloses indefinite grief. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the kettle screams, tea is forfeited, eternity is now portable. No teleporting props; crystals and tools are tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: Elias pockets the *empty* wheel and steps back as the carousel *does not* restart—conceptual cost is unmistakable, reconfiguring his ambitions from chase to stillness. Accumulative lens holds: each camera crank thickens thematic density until the ghost’s refusal crystallizes the new stance. Orientation anchored by line 7 (“kinetic lagoon hovered above the clouds”). No causality breaks; the jammed fragment foreshadows the ghost’s “No.”

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: sextant → star-sight → scanner coordinates → reroute flows → resonator reboot. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the terminal now offers star-paths she may never board, “hope quantified” but also commodified. One minor scaffold: “equations for hope” is repeated without deepening. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “glacial hush” and “petrichor nostalgia” thickens the ambient stake until the spiral of crystals reweights silence into song. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elias stands “lighter,” the dream transmuted rather than abandoned, with the felt cost of forever carrying both hush and melody. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elias, the introverted clock scribe”) and space is continuously tracked. One minor causality wobble: the crystals’ whispering is attributed to rain-lubricated vibration—an external physical save—but because the story is lyric-accumulative rather than causal, this coincidence complicates rather than resolves, so the beat is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: sundial anomaly → salvage → twin inscription → renunciation. Orientation locked by word 60; no debt. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “Time reveals the frame; lies collapse at dusk” reweights premise with undeniable cost—he abandons the quest. Persistent constraint: twin sundials in pocket literalize the reframed mission. No causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decoded rope becomes a living archive and Elias’s mandate to teach is the irrevocable new burden. Causality holds: fulgurite → reveal → pact, each step because/therefore. Orientation is swift and fog serves the final image. Cost is conceptual (custodianship) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Elias “lighter on the path of gold” crystallizes a before/after—he exits the garden re-mapped, no longer a cartographer of death but of enduring projection. Cost is legible in the frayed, luminescent thread tucked into the journal: a filament of splendor voluntarily severed, its sacrifice makes the new stance undeniable. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each obituary layers density until the cadence shifts from elegy to self-elegy that ends in earned poise. Pattern taught early (first paragraph’s bruised purple dusk) pays off in the moon-silvered lifeline.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chick’s imperfect emergence reweights the premise—beauty can exist only as flawed genesis—achieving Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (stalactites crack, gears falter). Causal chain holds: each scavenged fragment is assembled because of the hypothesis that organic life must be rebuilt from mechanical ruins. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words (stalactite palace, night, lone prince). Lens stays Accumulative/Textural: repeating “quaked/hypothesized” patterns tighten until the final color-flash reconfigures stakes. Minor hairline: the palace’s physical jeopardy feels slightly external to his body, keeping it shy of 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return of black sand, kelp drift, and obsidian reweights the stake until the red-threaded coin clinches Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no disorientation serves closure, so test waived. Closure—new life grafted onto fire-scar—carries felt cost: her father’s coin now forever pins her own healed skin to the dune’s wound. One hairline slip: the phrase “to prove that scars can sing” is an abstract set-up never concretely tested, keeping it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb adds density until the final image reweights the stake (“memories cascaded…fountains gurgling anew”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—time restarts and the city reclaims its past—visible on page. The price is felt by the city, not Elara, so cost is social rather than personal; still, the before/after is legible. Orientation is taught early (“city of forgotten fountains…migrating geese paused”), so no penalty; lens stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: gear embedded, fledgling altered, Elowen dissolving into drift—options re-cast, cost (her fade, eternal vigil) legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ping density and petal cadence tighten meaning rather than causal chains, culminating in the crystallized final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by second sentence (“in the nebula garden…”) and never slips. One minor scaffold: “across petals’ sigh…she pinged once more” repeats the sigh/ping dyad in adjacent closing lines (−0.2), but it lands inside the resonance, not the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared in the first sentence—“fractured glass panes caught the fading sun like shattered memories”—and held without waver; each dusk layer adds density until the ribbon’s knot becomes the pattern break that reweights grief. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the woven ribbon roll’s final reroll is an image that redistributes sorrow’s weight across the community, with the cost legible in Elias’s tears and the specters’ dissolution into departing wings. Orientation is anchored within 30 words, transitions are legible across the migration weeks, and the greenhouse’s humid air remains a coherent crucible. No causality breaks; even the spectral mentorship is framed as inherited pattern, not off-stage contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: youthful sabotage → village imbalance → daily penance → today’s ritualized climb → handle-triggered vision → pendulum pause → absolution. The pendulum pause is the decisive on-page pivot where time literally stops and cost (30 years of micro-amends) is made legible; the final descent with “caressing rather than clawing” waves shows visible after-state. Orientation is secured by line 3 (“precise local clock tower winder,” “low tide unveils the path”). One non-closure hiccup: the climb itself contains no live obstacle—no slippery misstep, no gust forcing a mid-route choice—so escalation is purely interior; under the Causal lens this is acceptable but keeps the piece just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the noblewoman’s plea reframes the cemetery’s whispers, giving the echoes social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each teased thread tightens the pattern—yet the beat-to-beat linkage is more associative than consequential. Orientation is clear within 120 words; only one reflective block (sovereign case back-story) exceeds 20 % but is anchored and tilts present goal, so BRR waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias models within chains, therefore enforcers close, so he must commit ink or lose everything. Anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 3 and serve closure. Closure is Charged Poise: the quill’s “infinitesimal from union” crystallizes options and cost; failure to ink would still doom the realm. One scaffold loop—“the quill trembled…ink beading”—softens but does not break causality at the hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the alcove dims, dust keeps dancing, legacy now externalized. Causal chain holds—because she transmits, therefore dust awakens; because drones hunt, she desists. Cost is palpable in the ‘thistled calm’ that ends the piece, a crystallized tension not yet discharged.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s arrest crystallizes the moment when Elias scatters the dust and simultaneously confronts the illusion that anything can be “safe.” Cost is legible in the sentence “crystallized emotion settle cold in his chest,” a direct visceral price. Causal chain holds: because the chair stops, the rite must culminate now; therefore he burns, grinds, and scatters. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—image density (ash, porcelain, vanishing point) reweights the stake rather than a plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens declared and sustained: each stratum is a because/therefore trigger—ash deepens doubt, astrolabes restore conviction, logbooks lock resolution. Closure is decisive: cog-frame marriage is a physical act that forecloses retreat; “Rebellion rationalizes truth” etched in situ supplies undeniable cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; no prop or knowledge teleporting. One meaningful tightening per layer; final image (cog pulsing as second pulse) reweights all prior narrative competition.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rosette’s glow and the single hum reweight the premise that harmony is subtraction. Causal chain is thin—choir members soften because they “mirror the rosette” rather than through dramatized beats—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation is clear by 120 words; one transition (weeks → dusk) is legible. Cost is implied, not viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the seedling’s iridescent leaf reconfigures the stake from solitary act to contagious idea, with the greenhouse spotlight as visible cost. Causal chain holds—prune → plant → taste → legacy—though the mid-text infodump on Regime labs momentarily pauses pressure. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each snip layers memory-density until the alignment cadence crystallizes meaning. Meets 9+ quick test except for that expository stall.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lattice holds: curse → blunt truth → riddle box → Mira’s climb → hive restoration. The blackout and failing hive are anchored by word 30; orientation is never in doubt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s hum will return, but the social contract between toll-man and city is re-priced—wonder is now a toll paid in risk. Cost is legible in the heirloom relinquished and the climb undertaken after dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned locket-and-shard ignites the bungalow’s “blaze flaring brighter,” reweighting community connection under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds—each collected object thickens texture until the return ritual crystallizes meaning—but orientation is soft: “quiet bay” and “spring’s soft swell” drift 70 words before we anchor in Elias’s gait. The decisive change occurs on the page with felt conceptual cost: houses once “hollow shells” now “pulse with shared silence,” a social repricing that makes the prior isolation legible. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the orris shard’s veining is the persistent constraint that shapes every sanctification beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each revelation functions as a because/therefore linkage that narrows Elara’s moral options. The closure—her surfaced resolve to “thread nuance into her legacy”—is a Charged Poise that reconfigures the stake with undeniable conceptual cost: she must live the contradiction forever. The silver-kelp thread sequence is the decisive physical act that pays off the ampoule’s structural weakness, sealing the memory back into the city’s bones. No causality breaks; even the statue’s animation is pre-cued by “foundational magic” established in line four.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands under Accumulative/Textural lens: equations layer until dice embody theorem, rupture reweights missed-leap memory with conceptual cost (“wind’s kiss, love’s potential grasp” denied again). Single-scene anchor clear by 50 words; helix taught early, pays off. One meaningful intensification: flawless die shatters, equations fracture, staircase reseals—earned rupture. Causal chain is secondary; pattern break suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moon-waned brush cools, Elias sleeps, and across the city new lanterns reply—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of both his insomnia and the strangers’ hidden kindness ledger. Causality is causal-plus-textural: each vision flows because/therefore from the brush-stone drinking moonlight, tightening the stake that mercies must echo. Cost is pinned to the exact sentence “For the first time in months, a gentle drowsiness tugged at him,” making the lost language graffiti the price of his sleeplessness finally spent. No ambiguity in lens or orientation; pattern taught by line 3 (“waxing moon’s glow”) pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens shards distributed in flight crystallize the before/after of exile reborn as troupe. Causal chain holds: thaw → breach → lens glimpse → opera-house pivot, each because/therefore legible. The stakes-tightening occurs the instant Veilfall shatters, foreclosing sanctuary. Cost is conceptual—loss of grotto forever—felt in the roar that “roared on, guardian of ghosts.”

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the backward-spinning lighthouse beam is a Resonant Reconfiguration that repatterns the island’s fate at visible cost—Elias’s desiccated body. Causal chain holds: yoyo reverse-engineered → spindles decouple → time rewinds → vitality drained. Orientation is swift; who/where/when fixed by line 3. One soft spot: “latent radiance” is declared before we learn it can ignite; a 0.2 sting for rule-teaching lag, but the final image pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: resuscitation → glow → photo-curse → Fear’s hunger for hidden truth → paradoxical confession as bait → clasp-throat moment. Closure is a Decisive Change: Fear dissolves, glow recedes, curse lifts, but Elara is branded by her own tactic—cost is the retained seductive scar. Orientation anchor (who/where) delivered by line 3; no teleporting props; dream-dictionary set-up paid off in mid-scene unbosoming beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam glances off a dome of sound, leaving the orchard still afloat—cost is the prophet’s exhaustion and the perpetual promise “half-kept.” Causal chain holds: cloud pattern → sketch → fractal dub → harmonic deflection. Orientation is swift (blue hour, sea-orchard, Elowen named by line 3). One causal tightening suffices; no plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    The inferred lens is Causal: each whistle question tightens possibility until the shell cracks and forecloses escape. Closure lands with visible cost—the city adrift, Elara whistle-silent—meeting RR/Charged-Poise. One causality hiccup: the gate’s original rusting is blamed on the earlier expedition only in the retro-vision, not seeded in present action, so the rule feels retrofitted at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single causal spine: petal-drop → letter → microscript → ledgers → publish; each because/therefore link narrows options toward exposure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the illuminated letter, once decorative, now re-weights national myth as war crime—felt cost in Elias’s “heritage felt whole.” Ivy and rose motifs repay disorientation waiver; station geography remains coherent. One scaffold phrase (“noble lies had served their time”) repeats twice without fresh pressure, a minor artifact not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion now literally contains his archived grief, the drawbridge still risen forecloses retreat, and the empty inkwell is the felt price. Causal chain holds: because he stays after the bridge lifts, therefore each note is mortared into a future he cannot enter. Orientation lands by word 80; no teleportation of tools or knowledge. One tightening beat—pinned leg under lintel—escalates risk and is paid for in the final gasping surface.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: stamp falls → she catches → ink hypothesis → coordinates → vault opens → truth costs myth. Each because/therefore linkage narrows her options until the final renunciation of the founding lie. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the city’s guilt is now hers to carry in stillness. No orientation or lens ambiguity; blackout even pays off as the literal condition for phosphorescent ink.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cranes burst skyward, literally converting luminous torment into harmless sparkles—an undeniable before/after image that reweights grief itself. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: each added crane intensifies density until the final release. Causality is lyric but coherent; every fold is a because/therefore of grief’s transmutation. Cost is visible in the emptied basilica glow and Elar’s lighter stance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pulse, spark, and cooling breaker adds density until the vacant ten-minute window reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—crystal sealed, breakers still humming—cost is the irreversible self-redefinition legible in “sovereign of the unseen.” Causality holds: the cooling timeframe literally opens the psychic space that lets her perceive the vacuum pool. Orientation is taught by the fourth sentence (floating observatory, mile-high), so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage holds: chart fragment → star-trail data → lever pull → frequency ignites, with each step tightening options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the same dome that began “eyeless” ends by “cradling wholeness,” crystallizing belonging for both. Cost is legible—Elara forecloses her exile by embracing the chip’s call, pilgrim softens from frozen awe to weeping peace. Minor slack: pilgrim’s surprised trait never feeds a choice, so his beat feels ornamental, not motivational.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the frozen watch hand and turning away from fresh driftwood crystallize a before/after in stance without exposition. Causal chain holds: manufactured lies → shore evidence → recognition of shared silence → vow to break cycle. Accumulate-textural lens is taught early via sifted symbols and holds through final image. Cost is felt—the hollow in the pocket, the retreating waves—but could be even sharper if the vow were shown in micro-gesture rather than narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain intact: forged pull → war → captive brother → parapet apology → synchronized release under lunar cue. Single scene, anchored by 40 words, no teleporting props; true pull’s reveal tightens stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis: relics swap, prisoners freed, but feud remains fragile—cost felt in her relinquished talisman of shame. One tightening beat suffices; no outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the single star aligning with the eighteenth pole reweights the entire journey, giving Elias a “true north” whose cost is the soaked kayak and the dawn he must still face alone. Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—pole count leads to star, star leads to beach, beach leads to whispered credo. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored inside 120 words. Minor cap: one paraphrase loop (“merrily melancholic” repeated three times in final third) keeps Q2 from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear reweights the premise—“oblivion denied, empathy possible.” Causal chain holds: baseball signature → newspaper cipher → descent → lake fork → tear. Time-travel rule is kept off-stage, avoiding late-breaking gimmick. Cost is felt in the final image (cracked leather, glowing water, shared path), satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara becomes beast, Thorne returns as spectral wolf, reunion achieved under moonlight—visible cost is the permanent loss of humanity. Causality holds: fortune → spices → rite → transformation. However, the Orientation Test nicks −0.3: “who-where-when” anchor drifts until ~140 words amid lyric sprawl, and the mosaic of beasts/unicorns/griffins risks cluttering spatial clarity. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via recurring scent and moon imagery, held to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces omniscience by literally giving the pilfered seconds to her child; the tick-synced breath is the on-page cost image. Causal chain holds—birth weakness → ascent → cloth spread → saucer fracture → clock release → descent—each step a because/therefore under the Causal lens. Orientation anchored by word 60: “midnight glade above the clouds” and body-in-moss spatialized. No lens ambiguity; the final image re-weights the premise: time is no longer stolen but entrusted, and cartomancy is relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stitched filament layers density until the tapestry itself becomes the key. Closure is a Charged Poise—portal open, laughter spilling, cost legible as her permanently lightened body. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Millennia had passed…”) and never wavers. The causality is recursive memory→stitch→levity→portal, all on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmless ember-fall reweights prior gifts into mythic healing without Elias choosing sacrifice. Causal logic is situational/accumulative; coincidence guides convergence, yet pattern is legible and fulfills prophecy with felt communal cost—illnesses lift, volcano quiets. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; only minor drift is the late “slow dance” label. Closure cost is palpable in the final image of black sand turned cradle; lens holds. High-band gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → dial decode → crystal retrieval → faint vein-pulse, each step tightens insurgent possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara melting into shadows while the fort “waits for ignition”—the conceptual cost (perpetual danger, no triumphant shout) is legible. One transition (garden→vault) is clean; orientation anchors within first 120 words. Persistent constraint (her sentinel access) shapes every tactic; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each rock placement heightens textural density until the dust nebula reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the frictionless world’s premise is affirmed, Kael’s curse flipped to blessing with felt cost in the laughing release. Orientation anchors within 30 words; no causal breaks; pattern taught early and paid off. One persistent constraint—the absence of friction—shapes every tactical slide and final image of eels in arcs.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timer clicks and lightning flashes pattern-tighten until the poem’s arrival reframes the vigil. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance shifts from isolated cartographer to node in a clandestine network, cost encoded in the laugh that accepts perpetual endangerment. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; the envelope’s late arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain holds: sundial → cipher → alliance, but the cipher reveal is narrated rather than dramatized, blunting the decisive change. Closure image—“together, we fence the unknown”—is resonant reconfiguration yet cost is asserted, not felt; no persistent price anchors the new pact. Orientation is clean by word 80, but lens ambiguity creeps in: is the duel real combat or choreographed ritual? Without confirming stakes bleed, tension leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Moonlight shards through eaves → tin of seeds → garden of words: causal chain tightens under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each shard adding density until sprouts punch concrete. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single time-skip (night-to-dawn) is sign-posted with “Hours bled.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tin now holds maps, the “sky” is reclaimed, and prisoners read in flower-light—undeniable social cost even if emotional cost is oblique. One minor slack: the riot threat stays off-stage; if guards had once kicked over a half-built shelf, the escalation would feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s first post-3:17 tick re-prices time itself, undeniable on-page. Causal lens holds throughout—because Elias slows the reel, therefore he sees the map, therefore he climbs, therefore the clock moves. Cost is the climb’s foam-drenched danger and the final surrender to perpetual night-watch in the grove. No orientation drift; who-where-when is anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the islanders wake humming lost songs, proving memory restored. Causal chain, however, is soft: seed → dream → Guardian stirred → memory fixed relies on magical logic never grounded in constraint; failure risk is declarative (“monsoon will wash us clean”) but never tightens tactics. Orientation clean by 120 words. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at final image satisfies, yet cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via tidal cadence and lace pattern; closure = Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky’s cerulean is conceptually repriced from wound to compass. Escalation is density increase—each pruning beat darkens the mist, tightens the grove’s breathing—until the final image reweights the color as portable forgiveness. Persistent constraint: the compass needle will keep pointing inward, an ache she now chooses to carry; cost legible in “tears traced her cheeks, diffusing into rain-damp ground.” No orientation debt; spatial anchors (pebbled shore, grove center) secured by sentence 40.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with fractal dust patterns building toward a Conceptual Repricing: reality is preprocessed through decay. Orientation is immediate (“storm-damaged greenhouse,” “flood,” “coastal observatory”), and the closure—a published paper and reborn research—carries conceptual cost (abandoning dramatic models). The tightening occurs when Elena applies butterfly dust to data, stripping noise to reveal pulsar folds. One flaw: the transition from observation to application lacks a micro-hesitation or failed attempt, softening causality just enough to deny 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara shifts from artist to guardian, with visible cost (kiln destroyed, trauma endured) and a Charged Poise in the final luminous installation. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—frost patterns, ledger gaps, and light motifs build density toward revelation. Causality is maintained through pattern recognition; no coincidences resolve core conflicts. The ledger’s burial and retrieval form a tight causal loop that pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: silence becomes “vessel,” not void, with visible cost—the cracked pane, Kai’s scars, Elara’s storm-etched face. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional heat maps build density until the final cascade of forks reweights the hush. Every beat flows from prior cause—no coincidences resolve pressure. The conservatory’s fragility tightens stakes organically.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (light, silence, fractures) until the final lattice of prisms reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias achieves permanent quiet by merging with the light, at the cost of his body. The causal chain is tight—each shard placement silences a signal, escalating pressure toward the apex act. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “Elias's spirit occupied the ultimate impossible space: rest, addressed forever in the deep.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of anonymous acts culminating in the “Shadow Harvest” declaration—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community crystallizes its stance. Cost is legible: enforcers patrol, fear persists, yet they choose reciprocity anyway. The antique bell’s muffled toll stitches doubt into trust, and the final image reweights all prior scarcity into legacy. Orientation is immediate, causality coherent, closure earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, sparks, breath, and wisteria build a resonant pattern that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing—unused love is not hoarded but released through shared presence. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30. Closure lands with undeniable cost: Elias abandons the quest for a distant vault, accepting that love must be given now—a reconfiguration charged by Kwan Yin’s tear and the viaduct’s lucid fog. The final image crystallizes this shift without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias achieves Earned Stasis by shattering the retrocognitive trap, with visible cost (photographs disintegrate, fragment is lost). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of hyperbolic imagery and sensory layering intensifies until the fractal climax reweights time’s nature. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early (“was it always night?”) but pays off in the timeless reverie of the ending. Cost is legible in “photographs crumbling to dust” and “fragment’s demise.”

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: Elara transitions from chained captive to free sower of resilience—a Decisive Change with tangible cost (months imprisoned, near capture). The causal chain is tight: Wall falls → chaos enables movement → cipher decoded → vault accessed → escape executed. The drive lens is Causal, held throughout, with each beat narrowing options. The piano bench cipher, though sudden, is foreshadowed by her daily scanning and prior carny lore.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias emerges regenerated, owning betrayal’s warning—a reconfiguration charged with conceptual cost (trust’s fracture is now audible, not just felt). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: auroral light, bioluminescent fruit, and shipwreck whispers layer into a resonant density that peaks when the spiral absorbs his bottled silence. Orientation anchors instantly (“sunken orchard greenhouse… Elias hunched”), and causality flows through sensory logic rather than plot mechanics. Cost is legible in the final line: “he owned its warning”—a stance crystallized through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned imagery (golden hour, emerald station, floral codes) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara realizes she doesn’t steal destiny but is chosen by it. Closure lands via Charged Poise—she boards the train with jar and portrait, destiny’s door “swung wide,” carrying the cost of her old identity. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3 (“Elara Voss… golden-hour portrait thief”), and causality remains intact through tactile discovery (panel, jar, glyphs). The moonbeam jar’s late activation could risk deus ex machina, but alchemical world rules are seeded early (“built by alchemists”), legitimizing the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and ritualized narration. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elias renounces nomadism for sanctuary-building, with the bookmark and molten spheres reconfiguring meaning. Yet cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—the “floods murmuring through vents” threaten but never impede, and no option is truly foreclosed. The ice-melting timeframe creates ambient pressure but doesn’t tighten decisions causally.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Harlan is destroyed, Elara reclaims agency. The causal chain holds—betrayal → flight → discovery → confrontation—with the seashell enabling but not resolving the climax. Cost is legible: her identity was stolen, her body used, and she risks death to expose truth. The library setting and phobia logic cohere, though the shell’s sudden sentience borders on deus ex machina without fuller integration into established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: silences accrue meaning until the map coalesces. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“storm-tossed ridge fort,” “pebble-shore oracle,” “Elara”). Closure is Charged Poise—the ambered hush crystallizes into a usable fragment against encroaching void, with conceptual cost (erasure mapped via loss). One tightening occurs when the oracle shifts from recitation to active sketching, narrowing options to retelling-as-navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: thoughts arise not from code but from interstitial pauses within mundane repetition, reweighting the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via looping violin notes and fractal timelines until convergence at the sixth loop. Cost is legible in the brittle violin’s sublimation and the robot’s quiet renunciation of mystery for companionship with thought. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the pattern of loops is taught early and paid off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: both characters renounce solitude through shared silence, with visible cost (Elias closing his ledger “forever”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—whispers, rain, doodles layer into a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (“crystal whispering forecourt after rain”), and the single scene tightens via Elias’s decisive act of placing tickets. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: luck is malleable through care, not immutable fate. The fountain’s new heart marble (9.3) crystallizes this shift with undeniable cost—the decades of neglect Elias endured while tending a “low-luck” space. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished marble intensifies pressure until the auditors’ scanners leap. Orientation anchors instantly (“garden maze of Eldergrove… dusk”), and the drive lens (textural accumulation of resilience) is taught by paragraph two and held through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nexus reveals time’s lateral flow, reweighting human chronology with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory and temporal layering until twilight’s hush crystallizes into revelation. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; causality remains intact despite lyrical compression. Cost is legible in Lirren’s unlived memory and Elara’s crystallized vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with water-damaged imagery and lantern light layering meaning until the final aria crystallizes purpose. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias departs with the score, the opera house collapsing behind him, cost legible in the drowned program and alarms wailing. The inciting discovery, disruptive act, and retrieval form a tight causal spine within the accumulative frame. One flaw: the grate’s existence feels minimally foreshadowed, risking slight deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts the weight of half-spoken truths, foreclosing any illusion of clean prophecy. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via aurora, berry, illustration, and smudging until the final image reweights all prior motifs with sorrowful cost. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“mountain weather station,” “Elara,” “fever break”). Cost is legible in “winds howled a dirge” and “fault-tolerant soul etched deeper.”

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift reinterpreted as psychic residue, truth expelled as “feather-light revelation.” The causal lens holds—Jax’s past action (tampering) → present trigger (wheel) → confession → release. Cost is undeniable: “heavier than chains, yet buoyant in release.” Orientation is crisp by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper achieves regenerative silence, foreclosing surface return with the cost of deeper isolation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via layered imagery and cadence shifts, not causality—and holds coherently. The origami swan’s method triggers a decisive deepening, and the final image reconfigures the library’s decay into eternal vigil. Cost is legible in “frayed nerves” mended and the swan left for another, implying cyclical solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dreaming roots, softly adaptive, ordinary magic) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: Lila holding the locket as light returns. Cost is legible—Elias parts with his daughter’s curl, and Lila risks vulnerability. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the eclipse provides a natural cadence shift that deepens stakes without coincidence. The only flaw: the locket’s introduction feels slightly telegraphed rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered echoes, diary fragments, and tapestry symbolism until the final Charged Poise: Thorne mounts the fragment, aligning stories like stars. Cost is legible—the loss of all human dreams—and the displaced axis functions as both setting and conceptual pivot. The closure reconfigures the silo’s tilt from curse to compass, fulfilling Conceptual Repricing with undeniable emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s stance crystallizes into active orchestration, foreclosing his old path with felt cost (public recognition, irreversible entanglement). The Causal lens holds tightly—each beat follows because/therefore logic (fortune → discovery → plan → execution). Cost is legible in the dawn cheers and sirens: he trades anonymity for consequence. Minor deduction for the microdot specs’ sudden appearance lacking earlier foreshadowing, though it serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through looping rhetoric and layered silence until a Conceptual Repricing occurs: stillness is revealed not as absence but as generative stasis.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through embroidery details, candlelight shifts, and “adjacent possibilities” until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible: Elara’s lifelong isolation and performance of foolishness. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt observatory… autumn’s rustling hills”), and causality flows via stitched revelations rather than external action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and lyrical repetition intensify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the apology is finally spoken and wounds heal under moonlight. Cost is legible—the years of silence, the fractured vision, her tears amplifying the plea—and the shard’s glow signals irreversible emotional shift. Orientation anchors early (mangrove labyrinth, medium, lost lover), and the closure crystallizes the before/after without mechanical resolution. A hairline slip: the limbo-pulled Thorne risks convenience, but his form emerges from established spirit mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s whispered vow reconfigures shared anxiety into mutual witness, with cost legible in her tears and the pocketed coral fragment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered smudged notes, tidal patterns, and coral imagery culminating in the hidden drawing.

    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chaos converges through escalating density of patterns, beetles, and rebels until the greenhouse becomes a crucible of warped reality. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the gourd’s rattle reweights thought itself as untaxable—with undeniable social cost (the Bureau’s empire trembles). The “warp” motif constrains tactics throughout and crystallizes in the final image. One flaw: the transition from community gardens to greenhouse feels elided rather than taught, slightly muddying spatial causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elowen achieves sleep after centuries—but the decisive change relies on an external talisman (galaxy postcard) appearing via coincidence, violating causal escalation. The Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred early and held, with reef-shadow motifs and lullabies deepening atmosphere, yet the postcard’s late introduction (after 60%) breaks pattern logic. Cost is felt emotionally but not dramatized physically; the shell’s tremor substitutes for concrete sacrifice. Orientation is strong, but the deus ex machina undercuts pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: belonging is redefined not as possession but as “seamless interweave of breath, light, and ruin,” with cost felt in Theo’s isolation dissolving and Elara’s solitude transfigured. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—bioluminescence, feather glow, firefly pulses intensify toward a cadence shift at the shared exhale. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“Elara… slipped through a fractured pressure dome”). The burnt feather’s origin as comet relic pays off without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights the rule-set of memory itself—paths vanish not from erasure but because they are unrooted seeds. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via iridescence, seeds, and transliterating glass until the final cadence shift into “hopeful refrain.” Cost is legible in the “barren ground of doubt” that claimed her own path—a conceptual price made visceral through the dimming then flaring crater glass.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s creative spark reignites, catalyzing connection and collaborative plans—foreclosing her stagnation with visible emotional cost (tears, trembling).

The tide’s rhythm and scattered pieces create a coherent causal chain culminating in shared agency.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara chooses mortal connection over isolation, reconfiguring exile into voluntary presence. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the gaps between stars accumulate meaning until they yield verse—and the cost (abandoning purity for love) is legible in her lingering despite regained wings. Orientation anchors immediately (“twilight garden,” “Elara”), and causality holds: observation of gaps directly enables escape and inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism atrium becomes a testament that “ordinary light, refracted true, could reckon with the night.” Cost is legible in the lighthouse fracture symbolizing communal rifts and Elias’s acceptance of mending as resistance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered imagery (fog, prisms, ripples) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off at dawn’s fragile clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (fire, stars, porcelain) rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where shared breath and the cracked box reconfigure pain into guardianship. Cost is legible: Elias relives his mother’s loss; Lena accepts burdened vigilance. Orientation is anchored by line 30; celestial timeframe serves mood but doesn’t tighten decisions.

Cost is legible in the final sky “bruised perpetual green” and his vow to voice what walls dream. Orientation anchors instantly (“Elias Voss wandered the ruins...”), and causality flows through echo-driven discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through refracted light, lullabies, and heartbeats until mirrors reconfigure—a valid Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with undeniable cost: Elowen’s annual dissolution and the city’s altered reflections. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“Elowen, the elusive mirage painter…”). Yet escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; pressure accumulates but doesn’t tighten—she succeeds exactly as planned, with no meaningful obstacle or trade-off during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures her guilt to anchor peace, foreclosing personal redemption for collective gain, with visible cost (her life’s blood, the spectral boy). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via celestial imagery, ritual objects, and layered stakes until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 30. However, the “slow dance of celestial bodies” as deus ex machina slightly softens causality; the stars’ approval verges on external validation rather than internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias places the egg, foreclosing public redemption but gaining private absolution, with visible cost (tears, solitude, enduring amorality).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elias’s actions directly alter relational dynamics because he implants the eye, therefore trust returns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the orchard thrives not through eradication of truth but through tempered honesty, with clear conceptual cost (“silken deceit”). Orientation is solid by line 3; the inciting incident (finding the eye) and climax (testing lies) are causally linked. The final image reconfigures the premise: safety requires shadow, not light.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, opal dock, Edelweiss, and “softly persistent” motifs deepen until the final Charged Poise—Elias lighting the beam while wearing the flower—reconfigures isolation as sacred witness. Cost is legible in the closing image: he endures solitude but transforms it into purpose.

The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (bleeding starlight, fireflies, lace-like menace) that culminate in a decisive cadence shift at dawn. Orientation is clear by line 3; the pattern of dream → ascent → revelation → return is taught early and paid off cohesively. The shared exhale unlocking the vision is the sole micro-turn, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “pearl of presence” reweights the premise by proving shared resolve crystallizes ephemeral now into tangible density. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—twilight deepens, embers pulse, palette hues spiral inward—and cost is legible in Lirien’s transformed stance and Thorne’s recoiled recognition. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are established by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The whispered secret triggers fractalized time, a decisive intensification that narrows all prior wandering into this charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grave reweighted from end to rebirth marker, with cost legible in Elara’s “jaded bones” and recurring fatigue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via overlapping visions, culminating in the scroll’s completed narrative.

The inciting whistle and final log entry frame a before/after made resonant by the hydraulic clocks’ normalization. No causality breaks; disorientation is functional and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where sensory density and conceptual layering escalate toward a Conceptual Repricing: security through surrender. Orientation is immediate (“pre-dawn,” “bioluminescent mushroom farm,” “intrusion detection specialist”), and the single scene holds coherent pressure. The closure—a Charged Poise—lands with undeniable cost: Mira’s paradigm shift forecloses conventional defense models. The rat’s false intrusion tightens stakes without coincidence resolving tension; instead, it catalyzes insight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with cryptic scrawls functioning as a taught pattern by paragraph 3 (~25% mark). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elena reweights her father’s contradictions not as ruin but as authentic inquiry, with tangible cost—the burden of responsible stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: they sever ties and dive into their true forms, with visible cost (abandoning community, livelihood). The causal lens holds—scrimshaw triggers confession, which enables escape, guided by whale call. The island’s appearance is mystically consistent with established rules, not deus ex machina. Cost is legible in comrades’ futile shouts and receding docks.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of tied bouquet and carved turbine blade crystallizes options—performance as survival—and reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (emotional void persists).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through inked cards, measurements, and mythic echoes until the closure reweights everything. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“Elara's loft... post-crash world”). The inherited mystery deepens via Theo’s confession, and the ending delivers Conceptual Repricing: the World reversed reveals communal ledgers as antidote to speculative mania. Cost is legible in Elara’s shift from solitary scribe to shared steward—felt in the rain’s new “secrets” and the loft’s shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara realizes nostalgia itself is the forbidden knowledge—a seductive poison masquerading as truth. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with escalating density of sensory and thematic detail culminating in the pagoda’s revelation.

The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, escalating via arboreal symphonies that deepen insight until the corewheel climax. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara sees her courage reflected, reweighting the “leash” premise with emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—recurring motifs (star, lullaby, indirect routes) deepen meaning. Yet the inciting incident (“leash snapped”) lacks causal setup; its suddenness risks feeling unearned. Still, twilight vigil structure coheres tightly to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density of sensory detail, recurring motifs, and rhythmic cadence build to a Conceptual Repricing: “meaning hides in the hush you create.” The closure is earned through Elara’s art reshaping perception, with clear before/after stakes—fracture to fragile unity—and a felt cost in the ephemeral mandala. Orientation is immediate (“whispering grotto,” “Elara,” “dusk”), and causality flows through pattern resonance rather than plot mechanics. The emergent hush functions as both thematic and structural pivot, tightly integrated with setting and object.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Elara touches the tessera, she sees the minaret’s true call; therefore, she renames Kael; thus, he remembers his buried mercy and the plaza shifts. Closure is a Decisive Change—Kael becomes Kaelon—and carries conceptual cost: aberrant mercy encases sin in steel, not erases it. The shattered sky dimming visually validates the change. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30, satisfying orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: thermal hues, floating orbs, and fossil resonance layer into a crescendo that reweights mapping as emotional stewardship. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of maps including “floating thermal specters” redefines cartography itself, with cost legible in Lira’s aging, final float, and release of the fossil. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“coastal cave network,” “Lira the sensory map maker”), and the drive lens holds without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with patterned imagery (amber, echoes, buttons) intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: prophecy becomes possibility. Closure lands decisively—the jar is recorked, the hourglass inverted, the canyon sings—and the cost is legible in the warehouse’s sigh and Elias’s tremor. Orientation is immediate (“beneath sheer cliffs… amber warehouse”), and the single shard structure fits scope. The echo’s transformation from scramble to song crystallizes the before/after with poetic but unmistakable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses his own return to action (“Too burned for that blaze”) with visible cost (cyanide unused but carried), while enabling Lena’s activation. The drive lens is Causal—each beat links via because/therefore (e.g., snow codes → cipher key → hollow → Lena). Orientation is immediate (“Zephyr Bluff… Elias, the burned spy”), and the tightening—decoding the bluff’s message—narrows options decisively. Cost is legible: his legacy lives through her, not him.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the palimpsest’s core vow is revealed not as dominion but fidelity to the crossing itself, reweighting centuries of layered duty. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and rhythmic cadence shifts (gutter ticks slowing), culminating in a crystalline truth. Cost is legible in the unlayering process: false vows are unpicked, legacy simplified. Orientation is immediate and sustained; fog and river function as both setting and structural motif.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring images (smoke, sun patterns, thrumming), and layered timelines converge into a Conceptual Repricing—resistance as “quiet turning toward kindness.” Cost is legible in the oasis’s fragility and Kai’s solitary journey; the flattened smoke and fading thrum signal irreversible temporal convergence. Orientation is clear by line 3, and closure lands with resonant weight, satisfying Earned Stasis through charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s pruning of the rosebush “remains” while anticipating “tomorrow’s seeds,” reconfiguring loss into cyclical hope with tangible cost (the final petal gone, the bush bare). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (moonlight, gauge tooth, petals) until the harbor’s luminosity peaks and recedes. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira accepts the oar journey, narrowing emotional isolation into shared vulnerability. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquished talisman and Mira’s tear-streaked confession.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance shifts from lonely guardian to sovereign archivist, with cost legible in her forfeited solitude and acceptance of spectral mentorship. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via escalating hums, mist tides, and atomic reflections until the sundial’s alignment crystallizes purpose. Orientation is immediate (“floated through endless stacks… above churning clouds”), and the stone circle’s mechanics consistently shape events. No causality breaks; every echo stems from established resonance rules.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (twigs, spirals, rainbows) that deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing: love’s thread is not singular but woven from shared vulnerability. Closure lands via Charged Poise—their reunion crystallizes meaning without tidy resolution, and the cost (seven years lost, anonymous labor) is felt in Elara’s tears and vow to write openly. Orientation is clear by line 30; the temple, pond, and ritual are legible. The only flaw: Theo’s arrival borders on deus ex machina, though softened by prior letter lore.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s interference succeeds but leaves her vigilant, aware tricksters will return. The cost—“victory tasted of rust,” lingering “ethereal grit”—is felt and conceptual. The causal lens holds: because she decodes the signal via charts, she crafts a countermeasure that disrupts both cosmic and human manipulation. Orientation is immediate and precise; escalation tightens cleanly through one decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: spaces locked in stasis, fallow period ended, fears transfixed—all with visible cost (lingering claustrophobic echo, wistful siren call). The Causal lens holds tightly: Elias’s deliberate preparation → organ provocation → compass insight → decisive transfixion. Starlight and organ reverberation function as consistent causal agents, not coincidences. Cost is legible in “fingers steady despite the lingering claustrophobic echo”—a precise, embodied image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes into action, empathy awakened, with conceptual cost (her scar, enduring emotional exposure). The inferred lens is Causal—each beat links via “because/therefore”: evidence vanishes → families beg → she investigates → finds ribbon → unifies opposites → solves case. The quarry setting and lancet constrain tactics; the final image (mist parting, portrait hanging) reweights all prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s restoration of family honor crystallizes options while the jet stream’s unresolved threat looms, making cost legible in the “clammy maw” of enduring dread. The Causal lens holds—Thorne’s logs explain the shift, Hale’s suppression motivates conflict, and the nail unlocks truth—each beat tightening knowledge and stakes. Orientation is swift and functional; disorientation serves theme, not confusion. A decisive intensification occurs when the nail reveals suppressed logs, altering everything without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fiddler’s decision to follow the hidden trail crystallizes options with conceptual cost—the surrender of protective “nevers.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (flake, scaffold flutters, luminous disbelief) intensify toward a cadence shift in the bridge-song that reweights possibility. Orientation is immediate (mountain pullout, vanished hitchhiker), and the wet-plate flake’s discovery functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the final image—tucking away the glowing shard—as emotional armor gives way to vulnerable pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: recurring motifs (hoops, dusk, currency) deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing—Elias revalues his inheritance not as stolen loot but as curated heritage. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: he endures ruin, guarding his circle with quiet resolve. Cost is legible in the emptied train and dimmed lights, though the startup’s collapse occurs off-stage, slightly softening causality. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the inscriptions map variable eclipses, reweighting celestial observation as collaborative decoding. The inferred lens is Causal—dream insights directly enable real-world interpretation—and holds throughout. Cost is legible: Lyra’s frayed spirit, Thorne’s ethereal sweat, and the race against “light fails.” The telegram’s plea initiates pressure that tightens to solstice alignment, foreclosing delay.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Thorne emerges unguarded but not healed, carrying seed remnants and a recalibrated self-awareness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the orchard’s expanding circles, frost-kissed soil, spectral echo, and acidic plant accumulate into a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (truth vs. self-deceit). Cost is legible in the blood sacrifice and the visceral pain that sharpens focus; the vortex’s appeasement confirms consequence. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of spirals → circles → straightening trees pays off coherently at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: covenant restored, futures stabilized, yet Elara remains root-bound—a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (freedom sacrificed for balance). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cobalt pulses, scar-veins, and dream-threads intensify toward a cadence shift at the eclipse’s lift. Orientation anchors instantly (“cobalt glade at dusk”), and causality flows through sensory escalation, not logic. One flaw: the “eclipsed covenant” concept arrives mid-story without early grounding, slightly muddying initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara becomes a bridge between worlds, foreclosing her prior broken state at the cost of possible ensnarement (“wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring roots, bones, and card imagery until the final beat reweights meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality flows through ritual logic without gaps. The burned card’s integration crystallizes a before/after legible in bone and root.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Harl reconfigures his purpose from hiding to salvaging stories, with visible cost (career shame, grief) legible in the final image of him driving out. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through repeated “scrap” motifs and echoing blasts until the cadence shifts at decision. The trailer recedes as a closed chapter, satisfying the Orientation Test early and maintaining causal integrity within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated motifs (magnetic fields, seeds, cuneiform) thicken into a resonant reconfiguration where the arbor’s stabilization mirrors Elias’s internal equilibrium. Cost is legible in the spirit’s departure (“ambitions unrealized plunging into vapor”) and Elias’s quiet sacrifice of godlike mastery for communal legacy. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“Elias… in the magnetic arbor”), and closure crystallizes in Charged Poise—the final whisper to the wind carries earned cost without tidy resolution. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara departs with identity harmonized, routine now laced with awe—a legible before/after with felt cost (wonder nearly lost).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and symbolic density culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bunker becomes a nexus, not a tomb. Cost is legible—Elias reclaims Mira’s hope but implicitly accepts that connection requires vulnerability, not control. The seashell confessions and pearl integrate causally into the final act, avoiding coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 30, and closure lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with layered graffiti functioning as a palimpsest that reweights Elias’s guilt into shared wisdom. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: “forgiveness flowed eternally, like the Eldridge itself,” reframing the accident not as personal failure but as part of the river’s indifferent truth. Cost is legible in the taped bellows, the cracked platforms, and the unmedicated clarity that is both balm and burden. Orientation is precise by line 30, and the single-scene structure tightens pressure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she enters the Library of Unspoken Words, captures silenced truths, and emerges transformed, with the second letter’s looming presence crystallizing stakes. The causal chain—letter → watch → cipher → archway → sanctum—is tight and motivated. Cost is legible in the liminal window (“between those two fateful letters”) and the irreversible act of documentation. The drive lens is Causal, held consistently from inciting incident to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and recurring motifs (perforations, propagation, mulberry ache) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: destiny mended not by rejection but integration. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“velvet observatory at midsummer”), and the solstice deadline tightens stakes organically. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dream survives only by transforming the empire’s rigidity—and the ice violin’s use reweights all prior imagery. No causality breaks; every symbol serves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirien’s dual infusion fuses sparks into an eternal ward, reconfiguring the threshold from terror to reverence with felt cost—her near-dissolution and deliberate sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: auroral patterns, static hum, and fractal imagery intensify toward a cadence shift that crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights forgiveness not as absolution but as necessary decay enabling renewal. The vineyard hush, hairpin, and scalloping ritual cohere under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shifts deepening thematic density. Cost is legible—the razed grove, exiled kin, personal lag—and the hairpin’s discovery directly enables the rebirth act. Orientation is immediate (“umbral grotto above the clouds”), and causality holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: wind chimes, mirror shard, and cloak accrue symbolic density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Alex’s worldview shifts from binary betrayal to nuanced co-creation—with clear cost (abandoning revenge). The campfire-to-dawn timeframe anchors orientation early, and every beat tightens the thematic pressure. The only flaw: the chime “interpretation” borders on arbitrary, risking causality, but the lyrical mode justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story lands a Conceptual Repricing: youth requires total self-vanishing, reweighting the premise with philosophical cost. Orientation is strong by line 30 (who, where, when). However, the drive lens—Accumulative/Textural—is only partially sustained; the ripples encode truth, but the “delayed revelation” isn’t dramatized as a tactical constraint Elara must navigate, weakening causality. Closure is resonant but hinges on passive reception rather than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Thren gains motionless navigation, but the cost is eternal stasis amid bone towers—a resonant reconfiguration of his goal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: time deepens, flocks intensify, and harmonic throws evolve until the final aerial scripture reveals truth. The arrowhead’s appraisal culminates in a decisive fusion of knowledge and essence. Cost is legible in the final image: dust sifting eternally over his still body.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: luminance, frost, and mist patterns deepen until the keystone’s glow reweights automation’s emptiness. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “sacred simple” reframes creativity itself—with cost legible in Thorne’s renunciation of Artificer-imposed safety. The spire’s trembling and cloud-blooming auroras dramatize change without over-explaining. One flaw: the vortex’s sudden appearance lacks prior spatial setup, but its function as threshold pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with lantern light, tide recession, and spectral library layering toward a Conceptual Repricing: Lira isn’t lost but transmuted into the archive of luminous vows. Closure lands decisively—their reunion via shared light reweights silence into communion, with felt cost in Elias’s year-long vigil. Orientation is immediate (“late-shift pier lamplighter,” “annual sky lantern release”), and the Leviathan’s emergence tightens stakes organically. The key tag’s activation and book revelation form a coherent, escalating pattern without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the backwards prophecy reframes universal contraction as self-doubt preceding rebirth, with Elara’s beacon igniting expansion’s prelude.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elowen’s act restores cosmic balance while tempering his devotion into resilient vow, with on-page cost in fatigue, trembling hands, and near-collapse. The Causal lens holds tightly—each beat links because/therefore (drips dictate repair rhythm; imbalance causes crack surge). The viaduct’s tears and bell’s hum serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics. Cost is legible in “sweat beaded despite the cold” and “slumped” posture post-toll.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures his guilt but releases its isolating grip by weaving truth with Mira, foreclosing his old path of silent atonement. The causal chain is tight—drought reveals town, trail reveals memory, encounter forces reckoning—and each beat flows from prior cause. Cost is legible in “ashes scattering” and “lighter” patrol; the reservoir’s healed reflection confirms transformation. Orientation is immediate (“Midnight Ridgeway,” “Elias’s watchpost”) and never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara emerges harmonized, the cost legible in her relinquished fear of imbalance and the extinguished flame symbolizing completed rite.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures his burden, preserving trust at personal cost (“each vigil isolated him further”). The causal lens holds—every escalation (rogue updraft, secondary vortex) demands inventive adaptation rooted in prior skill. Cost is legible in the final image: “trust endured, fragile as a buckle’s clasp.” Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Kai’s dyad formation reconfigures his existence with felt cost (sacrificing solitary survival for shared vulnerability). The Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore links: Blade cuts pretense → exposes Elara’s fear → enables vivification. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“floating rock dojo… temporal vortices”). Cost is legible in the blood-mingling and trembling dojo, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed transforms from threat to genesis, reweighting Elias’s understanding of resistance as creation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered orthogonal approaches that deepen stakes without causal dependency.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist steps toward home not by rejecting exile but by interiorizing it, with clear conceptual cost—identity reshaped by uncertainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, pendant, and light boundaries accrue meaning until the portal yawns. Orientation is functional disorientation taught early (“veil of sleep,” “frozen garden”) and paid off at closure. Every beat tightens around the core tension between stasis and flux.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the crozier’s rebirth shatters Elias’s stifling fate, with conceptual cost in the obliteration of the original artifact and emotional cost in accumulated failures. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds through layered approximations, each deepening the stake via patterned refinement and cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 30; the nexus, twilight, and alchemist are anchored without disorientation debt. The “penny drops” moment cleanly pivots to total creative destruction, making before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s “abandonment” was design, not failure, reweighting all prior ruin into purpose. Cost is legible—the near-collapse of towers—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory and symbolic layering. The gorge’s transformation into an amplifier basin emerges organically from perigee physics established early.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing: time’s fluidity is reweighted as harmonious multiplicity rather than rupture, with cost felt in the spectral grotto’s dissolution and passengers’ reintegration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (hourglass, starlight, sideways clocks)—and closure crystallizes in the final image of Elias whistling, forever changed yet steadfast. One flaw: the anomaly’s rules feel slightly retrofitted to serve resolution, mildly softening causality.

Cost is legible in the final image: “memories, now stable in their alterations, wove him into the world at last.” Orientation is clear by line 2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Kai brings the chain link, therefore Elara deciphers edge geometry, enabling rift navigation. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kai departs ready to cross horizons while Elara recognizes the soul’s contraction—making before/after legible with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate (Abyssara, post-discovery), and escalation tightens cleanly from artifact to method to simulated portal. The final image crystallizes stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s shift from surrender to endurance carries visible emotional cost and forecloses suicide. The drive lens is Causal—each beat links via “because/therefore” (e.g., because Elara inserts the aid, she hears Evelyn; because she relays the message, Clara reframes her grief). Orientation is immediate (“Twilight draped the mist-clad atrium…”), and the single-scene structure adheres to scope defaults. Cost is legible in Clara’s tears and Elara’s spent pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures her phobia to witness her team’s digital ghosts, sealing their memory into lived truth.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through layered imagery until the scarf’s reawakening crystallizes into a Conceptual Repricing: stories live in hyperbolic, analog space. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Eliza refolds the scarf, grounded yet committed, with the library now “alive with curved potential.” Cost is legible: the tremor of near-loss, the grounding cough, the half-opened portal. Orientation is immediate (“hushed scientific poetry library”), and the pattern of geometric ritual pays off cohesively at midnight’s climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts the dream as image, not life, foreclosing literal recovery with visible cost (“luminous absence”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via repeated dawns, brushstrokes, and palette depletion—and the final print crystallizes a before/after. Cost is legible in the closing lines: “holding what yearns to flee” reweights the entire endeavor. No causality breaks; every beat flows from the cipher’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locksmith’s Charged Poise—choosing to stay while beginning his own unlocking—carries conceptual cost (deferred freedom) made legible in the final image of him tying a fresh ribbon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with starlight, ribbon, and hair accruing meaning until the nexus itself pulses with possibility. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (“shadowed nexus,” “cosmic hush”) pays off thematically at closure. Cost is unmistakable: he frees others before himself, and that sacrifice now turns inward.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and symbolic density escalating toward a Conceptual Repricing closure: the broken constellations and fairy ring coalesce into a holographic tapestry that restores memory, reweighting the premise of folklore as literal truth.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Kai’s shadow merges back, exile reversed, with clear cost—Elara’s exposed vulnerability and nervous backward pacing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tea-leaf geometry, mirror shards, and shadow-in-glass build toward a resonant lattice that unlocks return. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten library,” “Elara the shard-mirror archivist”), and causality flows through annotated patterns. Cost is legible in Elara’s solitude post-reversal—a quiet sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via Lirien’s ritual and Elowen’s restored wonder). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the fading of color—and the final image (the rainbow tree) reweights prior motifs. However, causality is soft: the ritual’s success relies on untested mechanics introduced at climax without prior constraint or failure. The “frayed thread” snipped at the end resolves tension conveniently without prior escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lirien forecloses his personal unrest by grounding others, with visible cost (hush-stained needle, lingering lucid unrest). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via knot-unraveling density, not causality. Starlight prisms pulse warnings, silt yields the net, and each spirit exhumed tightens thematic stakes. Final image reconfigures silence from trap to settled murmurs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reopens the chapel not to conquer silence but to honor it, transforming unknown into known through empathy—a Charged Poise where options and meaning are crystallized. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of silent cues (videos, wind patterns, torn map) builds to a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible—the emotional release of tears, the guarded sharing—and the persistent constraint of “shielded openness” shapes every tactic. Orientation is immediate and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines “letting go” not as loss but as entanglement without dissolution, crystallized in the snow globe’s final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered metaphors (radio transmission, quantum states, oceanic entropy) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible: she abandons possession for understanding, ascending with only data. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs until the mural’s completion triggers a Conceptual Repricing: unspoken needs become thunder heard across realms. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the world gains voice, Elowen’s role shifts—but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern pays off cohesively. However, the ghost’s liberation feels slightly convenient without prior failure or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: each floor adds a layer of encrypted truth, building density until the tenth-floor climax. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Lira’s identity reweights every prior detail—with undeniable emotional cost (orphaned legacy now claimed). Orientation is flawless by line 30; causality is maintained through the goggles’ light-diffraction mechanic. The only flaw: the meta-commentary about word count (“599—error…”) breaks immersion and should be excised.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of emotional cloud imagery culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: “empty spaces remember” shifts from hypothesis to lived truth. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes Elias’s stance with felt cost (the snapped string, his tears, the released log page). The orientation is immediate (“dusty starlight,” “sky gondola”), and causality remains intact through poetic but coherent logic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky mirrored inside walls reweights the guild’s abandoned ambition into enduring art, with conceptual cost (the tree’s destruction) made undeniable in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through fractal detail, stillness intensifies, and cadence shifts from hush to rupture. Orientation anchors instantly (“condemned tree trunk library,” “Elara, the face-blind portrait artist”), and the coin’s late reveal pays off because its pattern was prefigured in her artistic method. Cost is legible in “dust sifting like stars” and the salvaged planks months later.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story opens with clear orientation and follows a causal drive lens: discovery → deciphering → activation → escape. Closure is a Decisive Change—the airship reactivates and ascends toward a new realm—with conceptual cost (abandoning solitude for destiny). However, the starling threat resolves too conveniently via luminance repulsion, leaning on coincidence rather than fully earned causality. The hopscotch cipher’s sudden utility lacks prior setup, weakening escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “rhythm” shifts from mechanical precision to “the patient weave of loss and longing,” reweighting every prior image. Cost is legible in Elias’s bodily strain (“sweat beaded despite the freeze”) and the irreversible uncapping that unleashes the library’s pulse into his veins. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via recurring motifs (gears, eclipses, mirrors) until the cadence shift at climax. Orientation is clear by line 2: who (Elias), where (frozen library above clouds), when (distant morning).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard revives only when collective action replaces isolation, with visible cost in bramble scars and emotional hesitations overcome. The Causal lens holds tightly—each chalked message triggers a “because/therefore” chain culminating in the bell-ringing. Orientation is immediate and vivid; the floating arches and nebula anchor setting and stakes by line three. One flaw: Lir’s origin remains unexplained, but this ambiguity serves thematic mystery rather than undermining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where nested patterns, recurring imagery, and lyrical density build toward a Conceptual Repricing: time’s annihilation is softened by human tenderness. Closure lands decisively—the clock’s hands ease back, the puppet crumbles, Elias fades—with conceptual cost (his dissolution) made legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Elias; where: lighthouse; when: dusk before final ripple). The only flaw: the causal link between singing and clock reversal leans slightly on metaphor over mechanics, costing 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s unseen guidance crystallizes his role as reluctant guardian, with frost preserving his marks like lace—a visual metaphor for fragile, temporary salvation. The causal chain is tight: blueprint → nuts → impressions → escape. Time pressure (frost) escalates stakes coherently. Cost is legible in the final image: his isolation persists despite success.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with river imagery, chrysalis, and polymer metaphors layering into a Conceptual Repricing: bonds as transient, healing cycles. Closure lands decisively—the polluted waters clear, butterflies return, and Elias’s purpose shifts—all charged by the ravine’s lesson. Cost is legible: years of isolation, his wife’s death, ecological harm. Orientation is immediate (“Dr. Elias Thorne… wandered into the braided ravine”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “zero point before first word” reweights the entire premise, making absence generative. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of quantified voids intensifies until moonlight flares and slate blooms into prismatic map. Cost is legible: Elias vanishes, shop empties, identity dissolves. Orientation anchors instantly (“Glass shards… orchard library… Elias, the clean slate vendor”), and the lull-to-vortex arc tightens options coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elaris renounces isolation by absorbing communal remorse, foreclosing his brittle solitude with visible cost (physical tremor, emotional weight). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the rain initiates a density shift that culminates in the pavilion’s thaw. Cost is legible in the final image: “steps lighter,” memories “polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered sensory detail and linguistic convergence until the climactic bridge scene. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grain elevator talks are rehabilitated, and unity is forged through polyphonic dialogue. Cost is legible—the risk of irreparable fracture is averted through Elara’s labor—and the cuckoo weight’s repurposing charges the final image. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of starlight/silos/voice is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (mirror, helix, moonlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: abandoned dreams are not lost but entangled and recoverable. However, causality falters—the mirror’s “modification” occurs via unexplained neural interfacing, relying on premise over process. The closure image (helix-monument from silt) resonates but lacks a decisive on-page cost; Elara gains everything without measurable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: forgotten combinations no longer hide but “dance in her prismatic soul,” reweighting knowledge itself with the cost of vigilance now internalized. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—patterns intensify via luminous spirals, mist behavior, and gravity inversion—and the hour-long timeframe tightens causality without coincidence resolving stakes. The final image crystallizes a before/after legible through earned revelation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through resonant objects and layered silence until the porcelain-insulator-strum triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s “silence cracking open.” Cost is legible in the sculpture’s glowing fissures and the hedgehog’s quiver—felt, not heard. Orientation is immediate (“siskin alder grove,” “dawn,” “Elowen”), and the single scene tightens impeccably toward closure without slack or disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through magnetic silence, chess alignment, and leyline resonance until the final reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the covenant is glimpsed, not restored, with clear cost—Elias remains exiled, the phase still looms. The “eclipsed covenant” fracture is revealed through translated silence, not exposition, and the dent-guided alignment crystallizes stakes. Orientation is immediate (“exiled chess tutor,” “magnetic nexus,” “twilight”), and every beat tightens thematic pressure without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by paragraph two and held through closure: silence densities build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The diary’s opening delivers a Conceptual Repricing—quiet as the root of empathy—with tangible cost (lost time, sweat, memory-triggered pain). Orientation is immediate (“shadowed workshop under stars”), and the quake backstory anchors present stakes without bloating reflection. Closure lands decisively in the penultimate sentence: “peace reigned supreme.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stance reconfigures from ambition to harmony amid chaos, with wisdom emerging from endured stench. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of smell, motion, and doodling intensifies toward bloom, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible: her nose “once burdened, now savored,” implying recalibrated perception forged through torment. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: resilience isn’t natural but echoes channeled through a broken relic, reweighting the premise with cost (the planet’s wail, vines retracting). Causal lens holds—gravity inversion enables access, water flow guides her, touching the tip triggers memory flood. The ending image (orchards saluting, fruits gleaming) makes the conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30: pilot, glider, floating arches, crystalline fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: wind patterns → drone convergence → crash → investigation → report. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias redefines accident causality from tech failure to environmental-AI mismatch, with tangible cost (the silenced town, the dead engineer). The crater survey crystallizes this insight, and the transmitted recommendation forecloses future blind trust in preloaded AI paths. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (haze, labyrinth) pays off thematically and structurally at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory imagery until the auroral strike triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush softens, wonder is validated, and the world above subtly thaws. Cost is legible—the amber sheet dims as its magic is spent—and the final image of Elyra carrying it as a “talisman of validated magic” crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate and precise, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elaron returns transformed, driven by wisdom rather than shame, with visible cost (crumbling markers, lost orb). The causal lens holds—each action (placing markers, uncase, playing flute) leads to the next, culminating in insight. Orientation is immediate (“Thunder-echo Range,” “Elaron trudged alone”), and the single scene with one transition (into the spectral world) fits scope. The final image reconfigures his identity without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: transposed empathy is revealed as “the ultimate equation,” reweighting the entire premise with emotional cost made legible in Elias’s staggering disorientation and Mira’s enlightened departure. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of refractions, ambiguous phrases, and borrowed selves intensifies until the halo’s power crystallizes meaning. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; the star-vanishing clock tightens pressure coherently. Cost is undeniable: Elias endures emotional flooding to achieve insight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Thorne’s absence reweights from loss to generative myth via Kael’s act, crystallized in “Thorne's absence? A seed, long germinated.” Cost is legible in Kael’s relinquishment of the pendant and his acceptance of becoming “the myth’s next verse.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—auroral pulses, pendant hum, and shared visions intensify density until time warps, reconfiguring both characters’ stakes. Orientation is immediate (“Kael hunched against the wind on the aurora-lit ridgeway”), and causality flows through sympathetic vibration as a consistent rule.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias accepts objects absorb emotions, reweighting his entire epistemology with felt cost (denial shattered, professional risk implied). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—frost patterns intensify into legible language (*Feel me*), then names, then triumph. Cost is visible in melted blue rivulets and lab paper veiled in “academic hush.” Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s body fades, message departs, silence raveled—a decisive reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density (bamboo leaning, threads glowing) and cadence shift (loom’s clack intensifying). Cost is legible in “body slumping” and “form faded to mist.” Puzzle edges frame chaos into coherence, directly enabling the tapestry’s launch—functional within the mythic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elar emerges no longer meek, trailing floating sentinels that transform ruin into fertility. Cost is legible—the spent silk, years of solitude, scars beneath soot—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout. The shaft’s acoustics and dawn emergence crystallize stakes without causal over-explanation. One hairline slip: the magician’s arrival borders on convenient, but pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights her existence from burden to cosmic necessity, with the shard fusing to her hand as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory maps, parallel glimpses, and rhythmic repetition (“redirect”) until the final crystallization. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (“dream-murmur haze”) pays off in the closure’s earned stasis. One flaw: the second parallel universe arrives without clear causal linkage, slightly muddying escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s vow to protect the chain crystallizes options amid encroaching haunt and failing light. Cost is legible—the lamp is dead, Harlan is dying, safety must now be carried, not housed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via stacked stones, layered notes, sea glass, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. One flaw: the transition from lantern room descent to dawn departure is slightly blurred (“Alone? With Harlan?”), but not enough to break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered imagery (inkless presses, digital fog, uncoiling shadows), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—dawn reborn in balanced shadow. Orientation is immediate (“Emerald Lighthouse,” “Elias,” “post-midnight”), and the closure delivers undeniable conceptual cost: humanity’s screen-bound stupor is shattered by primordial dark. The accidentally prophetic wick triggers the turn, and Elias’s agency steers the escalation. Final image (“gilded not by light alone but laced with eternal night”) reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds coherently: sun trails, mist, and iridescence build density until the wing’s fractal map ignites revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elowen reweights narrative allure as perilous magnetism—and cost is legible in her vigilant embrace of caution. Orientation anchors are immediate and poetic (“valley-mist shrouded realm,” “new donor heart”), and the single scene tightens via light’s westward crawl. Only minor deduction: the climax hinges on an internal realization not fully foreshadowed by external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant’s purpose shifts from celestial measurement to earthly grace, with quantified sorrow zeroed into healing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream-maps layer over brass shards, storm syncs with breath, moonlight heals—culminating in the oaks’ rings redefining witness. Cost is visible: 3,204 arguments dissolve into 1,247 storms weathered, a precise trade. Orientation anchors instantly (“stormlit tower,” “Elias,” “moonlight”), and every beat tightens the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands decisively: the endless night fractures, dawn breaks, and Elara achieves Earned Stasis as whole witness—foreclosing her former fragmented identity with visible cost (memory loss during climax). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered songs and spectral convergence. The mica window’s early introduction pays off at closure, and the cost—personal disintegration during weaving—is legible in bodily and cognitive terms. No causality breaks; every intensification stems from protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (crumpled paper, paradoxes, midnight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “to hide is to be found.” Closure lands with undeniable cost—Elara sacrifices her solitary identity—and the nested structure mirrors the Order’s philosophy. The library setting, time pressure, and invitation all cohere to shape a Charged Poise ending where options are reconfigured without tidy resolution. No causality breaks; every beat advances knowledge or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where sensory and emotional density intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Charged Poise of shared tea and forgiveness in the reclaimed courtyard. Cost is legible in Elias’s tenuous absolution and the vanished bakery’s ghostly presence; the final image reframes decay as fertile ground. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure tightens pressure without redundancy. Closure lands with conceptual and relational weight, satisfying all requirements for elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring frequencies, vows, and sensory motifs until the resonant chord coalesces—a clear Conceptual Repricing that reweights entropy as reversible. Orientation is immediate: Elias, frozen library above clouds, mission to measure fading vows—all anchored by line 3. Closure lands via Charged Poise: the library ascends, vows mapped, but peril lingers in the drift toward cloud-tops, making cost legible (“brushing cloud-tops”). The pattern of sampling → decline → fusion → stabilization forms a coherent arc with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each false start narrows options until Lila’s decisive act shatters the truce. Closure is a Decisive Change—the deal collapses, the hush breaks—with clear cost (scattered pirates, dawn’s exposure). The wax cylinder payoff is earned by prior setup, and the rotting pier’s spatial logic holds throughout. One flaw: the third false start lacks sufficient differentiation from earlier ones, slightly blurring escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets weather-carriers as “earth’s echoes of stellar nurseries,” reweighting the story’s cosmology with conceptual cost—the loss of her former certainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds until auroral, forest, and personal weathers sync in a “terrestrially cosmic symphony.” The ending image (“ring quiet, tastes neutral”) crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt. Minor deduction for slight vagueness in how exactly the forests’ election triggers the convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias reclaims his art, but the cost—years lost, friendships built on concealment—is legible in the “auroral sorrow” that permeates even his renewed creativity. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (light, charcoal, memory) intensify until the portrait unlocks both box and self. The lock’s repair is causally grounded in prior setup (hidden compartment, mnemonic recall), and the final image reweights everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (gilded leaves, zinc fragments, weeping vines) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “Conversations lost are those unspoken true.” Orientation is immediate (“greenhouse city of Veridia… beneath the toxic sky”), and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the redefinition of loss itself. The map’s reassembly drives progression, and each descent tightens thematic stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s Earned Stasis—choosing silence even when her voice returns—reconfigures wonder as active guardianship. The iceberg’s thaw imposes persistent cost, and the bluff’s isolation sharpens stakes. Orientation is immediate (“High on the whispering bluff…”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory detail intensifies toward the kinetic climax. Final image (“sunset fracture on the ice”) makes conceptual cost undeniable—truth requires constant renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Zeta endures chaos not by fleeing but by ritual containment, foreclosing the path of passive nostalgia with the cost of burning its own childhood relics. The Causal lens holds tightly—magnetic shift triggers static, which awakens fears, which fuse with roses, necessitating miniaturization and incineration. Every escalation stems from prior cause, and the final image (“wholeness, pieced from shards”) reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: neighborhood tales layer into a path, culminating in the mailbox opening—a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence yields to shared voice. Orientation is solid by line 30; the courtyard, dawn, and locket anchor early. The outside world’s intrusion functions as patterned counter-rhythm, not causal disruption. Closure lands with conceptual cost: letters unburied, feuds dissolved—but the resolution leans on collective epiphany over individual sacrifice, slightly softening the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s liberation of data becomes soul-rescue, reweighting “vulnerability as strength” into collective action. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via lyrical motifs (spider’s web, dice, dance) that crescendo in the AI’s recognition and pod revival. Cost is legible: structural groans signal imminent collapse, charging every pirouette. Orientation anchors instantly (“sunken laboratory,” “rebreather”), and the single-scene shard fits 600–800-word scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias becomes guardian of collective memory, foreclosing his solitary quest with tangible cost—the loss of his old life. The causal chain is tight: whale’s beaching → gravity anomalies → coffee divination → exhumation → memory flood → embedding heart. Orientation anchors are immediate (“Elias the lantern lighter,” “docks,” “moonlight”), and the drive lens (Causal) holds throughout. Cost is legible in the dawn-lit return: he carries not just the heart but the weight of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence intensifies through mapped rings, crane-wing geometry, and brook’s response, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—prophecy silenced by design. Closure lands with undeniable cost: Elias’s burden lifts, but the world’s balance is preserved only through his precise, fragile labor. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when anchored by line 3), and escalation tightens via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Minor deduction for the climax’s near-summary tone (“flow accelerated… smothering coded utterances”) which slightly flattens peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because Elara hears the buildings, she seeks Harlan; because they share tea, trust builds; because meteors awaken the structure, truths erupt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as their agreed-upon lies dissolve and Elara speaks the building’s tongue, foreclosing deception with felt cost. The rooftop setting and meteor shower aren’t coincidence but catalysts that heighten pressure coherently. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single transition (apartment to roof) is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara forecloses reuniting with the lost lover by archiving the memory, dissolving quarantine not into freedom but independence—a legible before/after with emotional cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (petals wilting/reforming, fireflies as errant thoughts) until the seashell absorbs the memory. The “last star fading” deadline tightens causality without coincidence resolving stakes. Cost is visible in her dimmed—but tempered—radiance and the runes fading as purpose fulfills.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias severs the tether binding him to treason, transforming abandonment into mastery. Cost is legible in the ritual’s physicality (blood, thorn, scars) and the irreversible dissolution of his forged legacy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies via rhythmic stalactite drips syncing with heartbeat, aurora swirls, and dissolving ink—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. One flaw: the “unlinking rite” feels slightly expository rather than dramatized through prior cause.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered whispers and escalating hum until the shell’s final revelation crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: echoes persist not by fate but by perceptual attunement, with the cost being the merchant’s entrapment and Elyra’s solitude. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“canyon echo singer,” “serpentine nexus”), and the pattern of progressive disclosure tightens coherently. The final image reweights the entire premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara refuses to condemn, instead weaving truth to free souls, foreclosing vengeance at the cost of personal closure. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—dream cameos layer into a unified vision—and the shrine’s ice, candles, and borrowed starlight consistently anchor time/place by line 30. Cost is legible in the child’s locket salvaged and the ghosts’ sighs fading “like starlight at dawn.” No causality breaks; every cameo feeds the final exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (nets, fireflies, moon paths) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: hidden labor is revealed as sacred pattern. Orientation is immediate and vivid; closure lands with Charged Poise—the net is mended, but the true shift is Kai’s reconfigured perception. Cost is legible in the fireflies’ fading and the weight of generational toil, though physical stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias chooses silence, foreclosing his debunker identity at visible cost. The Causal lens holds throughout—each discovery (letters, blueprint, diamond) drives the next action. Orientation anchors instantly (“radioactive dust storms,” “breather mask”), and the stillpoint’s boundary creates a coherent spatial logic. Cost is legible in the final image: “Some truths were too fragile for the wasteland’s winds.”

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: prophetic fragments layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias broadcasts the final verse beneath parting clouds. Cost is legible in the radio’s silence and the shadows’ warning (“shadows devour their shapers”), though the climax leans on atmospheric payoff over causal consequence. Orientation is strong early (“stormlit observatory… above the roiling clouds”), and closure crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution. However, Mira’s sabotage and instant re-loyalization rely on whimsical magic that weakens causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias reaffirms his solitary calling after witnessing intergenerational resonance, crystallizing Charged Poise at dusk. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sounds and memories until the final waltz reweights all prior fragments.

Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the viaduct’s fall reweights freedom across the lowlands, with conceptual cost legible in “yokes falling silent, minds awakening slow.” The Causal lens holds—moon-tracking enables timing, rain weakens defenses, past failure informs restraint—and the decisive act is earned. The lake’s freeze provides a live constraint that tightens options, and the full moon’s alignment functions as a motivated ellipsis, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara forecloses her relationship with Marcus by destroying her phone and calling for a restraining order—a decisive break charged with vulnerability. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural + Causal): entangled memories accumulate until the train’s reverberation catalyzes action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “second opinions weren’t luxuries—they were the method by which broken hearts... deserved to beat anew,” reweighting the entire premise with social and spiritual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of clockwork metaphors and storm imagery intensifies until the final cadence shift at the heart’s revival. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30, and the single shard structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: machines awaken not through revolution but quiet evolution, reweighting the sea from grave to cradle. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via glyph decoding, algorithm trials, fleet ascension—with each beat layering thematic pressure. Cost is legible in the workshop’s “unvoiced envy” and Elara’s solitary vigil. Orientation anchors instantly (“acid sea,” “Gears-and-Cogs Workshop,” “Elara Voss”), satisfying all gate tests for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “nothing truly vanished” reweights deletion’s meaning, with felt cost (job loss) crystallized in “alarms wailed; corporate purge inbound.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—2519’s recurrence builds density until the patch unlocks truth. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“corporate memory keeper… cubicle”), and escalation tightens via Elara’s forged audit triggering irreversible consequences. Final image (“numbers lingered on her retinas”) makes absence legible as charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crystal orb reconstitutes, projecting a shared future that forecloses war with visible cost—peace requires mutual vulnerability. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via sensory density (mirrors, fragment, ice grind) until the cadence shift at reconstitution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora ceases trawling, having internalized the sound she sought, now “witness” not “tourist.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—wind, ice, breath accumulate into a resonant final image where aurora-lit floes become cathedral. Cost is legible in the snapped lace and stabilized woman who denies Liora her sound, pushing her toward Tomas’s hush. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality remains intact via consistent pressure from environment and desire.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: autumnal imagery, amber light, and recurring motifs deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing of “mismatch” as generative. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elena walks toward dawn with reframed understanding—but the cost remains abstract (no forfeited ring, unanswered call, or burned letter of her own). Orientation is solid by line 3, yet the single-scene structure lacks a meaningful tightening; Theo’s parable functions as exposition, not escalation. The burned letter fragment reweights meaning but doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): wisdom is preserved via peripheral ritual, foreclosing direct methods with visible cost (the rite’s fragility, the mask’s warmth/cooling). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through repeated clearings, dune-partings, and hums until the parapet steadies. Orientation is immediate: pavilion, dunes, prophet, line walker. Cost is legible in the final image: echoes secured, but only for those who look sideways.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring arcs and lavender/vine imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing: pain reweighted as communal luminescence. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the open map case as heart, vines applauding—as cost is felt in shared tears and confessions. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the gathering of townsfolk arrives conveniently without prior signal or resistance, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elowen’s realization that “growth eternal in reflection, even in silence” reweights the premise of linguistic finality with profound conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via layered echoes, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn’s full break. Cost is legible in her tears, weathered cheeks, and the hush’s offense at her “sonic defiance.” The pattern is taught early (crystal’s first glint) and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (chalk, driftwood, tape) until the amphitheater climax reweights them all. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias no longer drowns in forgetfulness because he’s anchored one truth—age’s sound—in analogue permanence. Cost is legible in “chalk stub clutched like a final tooth” and the looping tape growing older with him. Orientation is immediate, causal logic internal to the texture, not external plot.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock hand now “breathes with fragile rhythm,” reconfiguring time itself via Earned Stasis—Elias endures the quake to impose organic impermanence on machined eternity. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), held coherently from midpoint. Cost is legible in the fallen leaf, buckled viewport, and lost apprentices. Orientation anchors clearly by line 30; causality tightens via because/therefore logic (quake → spinning hand → leaf insight → calibration).

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory hymns, scent, and recurring vinyl motif, culminating in a Charged Poise where silence and light crystallize meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“mountain aerie… glass walls”), and causality flows through Elara’s deliberate actions. Cost is legible: Harlan’s life ends, but not before reconciliation—his smile is the price paid for peace.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: shadows don’t vanish but nourish a hidden realm, reweighting reality’s balance. The causal lens holds—each automaton unlocked because/therefore of prior loop-closures—and cost is legible in Elara’s exhaustion and the observatory’s fulfilled hum. Orientation anchors instantly (“nocturnal observatory atop floating isle”), and escalation tightens cleanly from inscription to holographic map. No causality breaks; the “spoons bent reality” backstory serves motif without disrupting present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s certainty “cleft” mends not through blind faith but “nostalgic innovation,” reweighting doubt into wonder.

Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with memory waves and polishing rhythms deepening thematic pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from isolated mourner to communal beacon via Earned Stasis—she accepts her earthbound role as purposeful. Cost is legible in the pearl’s “heft” and the villagers’ relief, though the inciting incident (finding sea glass) borders on coincidence. Orientation is immediate and sustained; the grotto, mist, and sea anchor who, where, and when by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: moss, icicles, light, and silence accrue into a resonant reconfiguration at closure—the pendant’s transfer crystallizes a Charged Poise where viral exposure gives way to intimate renewal. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality isn’t linear but patterned, with the icicle script functioning as a taught motif. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquishment of the heirloom and the implied surrender of solitary healing. The drive lens holds coherently from first image to last drip.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds coherently: each cameo appearance increases density and reweights the stake of creative survival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias walks “whole” against the current. Cost is legible—the narrowing timeframe, encroaching fog, and risk of oblivion—and the spiral seashell functions as a persistent constraint channeling memory.

Cost is legible in Elias’s harvested self-echoes (“doubts, joys, the wounded season’s quiet wisdom”) and the volatile fragility of stored wonder. Orientation anchors instantly (“Elias the locksmith descended into the marble cavern”), and the pattern of hourly reverse-engineering pays off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered silence, fractal imagery, and burden weights until starlight triggers calcification—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is legible: Elara’s boundary-less diffusion gives way to solidified form at the price of permanent entanglement with the burdens. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“bronze grotto,” “Elara the fractal weaver”), and the closure reweights the premise without exposition. The only flaw: the thief’s burden “defying measure” slightly undermines the system’s internal logic just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: snapping the locket shut crystallizes her stance, reconfiguring loss into purpose with felt cost (ten empty months, deferred tea). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (crystals, ash wood, “here and gone”) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation anchors immediately (“widow’s aerie,” rain-beaded skylight), and backstory is concretely cued by the carving blank. Cost is legible in the locket’s engraving and steam-thickened urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses the carousel’s restart, choosing grounded hunts over eroded ambition, with visible cost—his youth squandered, family fragmented.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal propulsion) that holds coherently through closure. Orientation is immediate and precise. The Decisive Change—decoding the frequency—triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: both characters achieve Earned Stasis in their longing, yet the final image (a new trail) reconfigures belonging as ongoing pursuit. Cost is legible: years of isolation mended only to be replaced by renewed questing—a quiet but felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated motifs (driftwood carvings, watch hands, “sieved hush”) deepen in resonance until the closure crystallizes as Charged Poise—Elias holding the watch hand “to the dying light,” resolving to speak truth. Cost is legible in the “stone smoothed by tides of tempered regret” and his vow to “quell deception henceforth.” Orientation anchors are immediate (“cobalt terrace at dusk”), and the single shard structure tightens pressure through sensory accumulation rather than causal turns. The driftwood carvings function as both discovery and reckoning, making the withheld truth undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the synchronized prisoner release crystallizes a Charged Poise where past betrayal is acknowledged but not erased, with conceptual cost embedded in Elara surrendering the counterfeit key. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows from prior deception, lunar pact, and mutual vulnerability—and the waning moon phase functions as both literal timer and symbolic constraint. Orientation is immediate (“storm-worn parapet,” “prisoner exchange negotiator”), and the single-scene structure tightens pressure without drift. No causality breaks; every object and choice traces to established history.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias achieves Earned Stasis by renouncing celestial navigation for terrestrial intuition, with visible cost (soaked, alone, rejected) and conceptual reweighting (poles as constellations). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (compass, poles, regrets) until the sky cracks open, aligning star and pole in a cadence shift that crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (coastal launch, dusk, kayak), and causality is maintained through pressure-driven choices. The lone star’s appearance feels earned, not coincidental, because it validates his method rather than solving his problem.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because Jax seeks absolution, he deciphers newspapers, descends tunnels, and reaches the lake—each step narrowing options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tear signals rekindled empathy, foreclosing emotional isolation with visible cost (his vulnerability, her remembered pain). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. The labyrinth’s rules are consistent, and Chronos’s baseball pays off without retroactive patching. However, Elara’s presence at the lake leans on coincidence (“as the newspapers had foretold”) that borders on convenient rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density (scents, moonlight, beasts) builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara and Thorne reborn as eternal guardians. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: their bond is reforged at the cost of humanity, crystallized in the final image of them running together. Yet the inciting object (fortune cookie) arrives without setup, violating causal plausibility even in a fairy-tale logic. The phoenix’s off-stage role weakens the rite’s grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirien descends with accumulated time now a promise, not a curse, the glade’s “velvet noose” loosening into grace. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring objects (tablecloth, saucer, ink) until the cadence shift at dawn reweights the stake. Cost is legible in tears, blood loss, and the irreversible winding of stolen seconds into her child’s breath. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (“choking beauty”) pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stitched tapestry enables dimensional breach not by force but integrated compassion—a Charged Poise that reconfigures her entire mission with felt cost (solitude, suppressed rage). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, escalating via density of tear-shimmers, photographs, and shadow manifestations. Orientation is clear by line 30; the “recycled spaceship” and “last human infant” anchor time, place, and stakes. Final image (“peace stitched the stars anew”) crystallizes thematic and narrative transformation with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias unknowingly fulfills a prophecy, transforming personal purpose into communal renewal without gaining material reward. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (light, hush, black sand) until their convergence at climax reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: his satchel gone, bugs released, yet “purpose solidified.” The “vibrant hush” framing pays off orientation debt established early, and the celestial alignment functions as both clock and catalyst without retroactive rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the fort’s partial re-illumination signals a silent revolution underway, with conceptual cost embedded in the Overwardens’ hoarding and Elara’s covert defiance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring objects and coded angles—and the blackout’s function tightens stakes coherently. Orientation is immediate (“luminous fort at twilight”), and causality flows through Elara’s deliberate acts, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael reinterprets the Slip not as loss but cosmic unity, with visible cost in his solitude and labor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns deepen via rock placements until aurora, eels, and dust cohere into revelation. Orientation is immediate (“tidal bluff,” “friction disappeared”), and the final image (“borrowed dawn held true”) crystallizes meaning without exposition. One flaw: the wife’s vision resolves too cleanly, slightly undercutting earlier dread.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and recurring motifs (scars as constellations, timer countdown) intensify toward a Conceptual Repricing—“the cartography of scars was communal.” Cost is legible in Elias’s isolation, censored past, and the envelope’s risk. The stormlit observatory setting and timer create a coherent pressure field that culminates in Charged Poise: his perpetual vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Causal (because Elias deciphers the sundial, they ally) fused with Accumulative/Textural (recurring angles, brook, chaos motif). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: rivals become allies against a greater foe, with visible cost (shattered glass, yielded duel) and conceptual repricing (“questions became their shared path”). The half-painted sundial’s transformation into a true-north guide crystallizes this shift. Every beat tightens pressure toward this alliance, with no causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library reborn as garden of resistance reweights confinement into creation, with visible cost (patrols, frost, exile). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (rust, stars, seeds) until the final bloom crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors instantly (“moon cleared the skyline… prison library”). One meaningful deepening occurs: sorting → rebuilding → sowing → secret gatherings, each narrowing options under surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s encore reconfigures fate, time, and memory into an eternal refuge, with visible cost in his five-year isolation and physical peril. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (clock, compasses, film) that culminate in the grove’s transformation. The frozen clock’s hands moving forward is a decisive on-page change proving conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the island remembers because Elara fused empirical rigor with dream logic, reweighting the premise that memory requires both proof and poetry. Cost is legible in her luminous doubt and the crumbling seed husk—proof of sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring images (petals, bloom, doubt) culminating in a cadence shift at “the island remembered.” Orientation is clear by line 2; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (“cerulean regret,” “rhythmically placid”) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the color of unspoken apologies is redefined as luminous forgiveness. Closure lands with felt cost—Elara’s acceptance carries the weight of irreversible severance. However, causality between beats occasionally softens into associative drift (e.g., compass suddenly revealing hue without clear mechanics), slightly muddying the escalation path.
