  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the canyon stillness, frost patterns, and ledger strip are meant to build density toward a reweighted stake. Orientation is anchored early (canyon, stars, Elara), satisfying the test. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Elara "decides to use this knowledge not for revenge, but to create something new" without forfeiting a live option or facing a visible price. The ledger's reveal of the rival artist arrives as convenience rather than earned discovery, and the final image ("drifting resonance of her own soul") asserts thematic resonance without reweighting prior material through a concrete, costly act or image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through the conservatory, layering heat-mapped emotions until the final tapestry reweights her grief into "harmonious" visual music. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—she steps back and views the completed work, feeling peace, but no option is foreclosed and no tactical price paid. The "rectify" repetitions gesture toward atonement, yet the text never dramatizes what she renounces or risks to achieve this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when clarifies only after the journey begins, past the 120-word gate. The piece follows a clear causal chain (package → coast → library → lens repair → closure) under a Causal lens, but the closure moment—souls dissolving into peace and Elijah's weariness lifting—lacks visible cost; the final image declares arrival and satisfaction without forfeiting a live option or paying a felt price. The "impossible space" solution appears convenient rather than earned by prior constraint. One meaningful tightening occurs (lens repair), but the stakes-test feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (arbor, Elara, sanctions period). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a declarative climax: Elara's speech crystallizes collective resolve and shifts from survival to future-building. However, the closure lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no dissenting voice silenced. The declaration feels aspirational rather than earned by prior reversals, and the final paragraphs summarize outcomes ("they began to leave small tokens") rather than dramatizing a single charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern does not meaningfully tighten or deepen—each strand released is identical to the last, creating additive repetition without escalation. The closure (releasing sparks, feeling healed) lands as summary declaration rather than a decisive image with visible cost; "she had healed herself" tells the outcome rather than showing a before/after state through concrete choice or renunciation. Orientation is present early, but the causal chain relies on convenient discovery (the tear) that solves a problem it did not help create. The Orientation Test is satisfied, so no additional penalty applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the story oscillates between causal setup (halo fragment causes visions), lyric abstraction (texture of time as fractal), and a physical act (bridge disintegrates) without teaching the reader how these modes connect. The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied by ~120 words, but the closure—bridge dissolving, visions flickering—occurs through summary rather than dramatized pressure. Cost is asserted ("trap loosen") but not shown in a concrete choice or foreclosed path. The ending lists outcomes ("new understanding bloomed," "profound peace") without an on-page moment where stakes visibly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors are delayed: carnival location and Elara's imprisonment history are established, but the wall's collapse trigger arrives abruptly without prior setup (−0.4). The arrow-to-piano-keys mechanism is introduced and resolved within two paragraphs, offering no meaningful escalation or narrowing of options. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the chain-loosening image, but the cost is symbolic rather than felt on the page—no decision forecloses a path, no visible price is paid. The lens reads Causal in execution but relies on convenience (guard lunges, Elara trips him, vault opens) rather than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (Elara), where (sunken greenhouse), and when (undefined present) are signaled early, but the spatial anchor remains vague—knee-deep water and a stone slab under aurora do not clarify whether she is indoors, outdoors, or how the greenhouse and forge relate spatially. The lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery, metaphor of cellular division, collecting absences), but no pattern is taught by the first third; instead, the piece delivers linear exposition ("Her journey led her," "She worked while," "Finally, she succeeded"). The ending offers a summary statement ("absences, when collected, could fill the emptiest spaces") rather than an on-page reconfiguration with cost; the "strange peace" is asserted, not earned through a decisive image or renunciation that forecloses a path. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.3 and lens-ambiguity penalty −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and follows a clear causal chain: flower code → portrait swap → trap signal → moonbeam escape route. Closure is a Decisive Change (she escapes with the stolen portrait) with stated emotional cost ("luminous disbelief"), but the cost feels asserted rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or tactical sacrifice. The black-orchid reversal arrives as convenient setup rather than pressure earned from prior choices. Drive lens reads Causal with situational accents; it holds through the ending, but the final cost is more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the window (glassblower, control room, thaw). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ice melting parallels emotional thaw—but closure lacks visible cost: Elara simply packs and leaves, with no on-page decision that narrows options or reweights prior material. The sphere and bookmark are left behind, but this gesture is asserted as "testament" rather than dramatized as renunciation with felt price. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the thaw progresses in parallel summary without a causal or textural turn that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: "Leo, a stunt double" and "rusted library under stars" establish who/where by the opening, but the timeline ("Only days ago") and the Silas-hunt stakes remain abstract until the child appears mid-story. The closure—Leo "outwits" Silas by declaring his fears are strength—is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off. The dominant lens (causal) breaks when Leo's "plan" and the tower confrontation occur off-page, then are summarized. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and closure validity failure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed; who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the first ~150 words, causing drift (−0.4). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs: the Oracle begins meditating, continues meditating, and finishes without reversal or reweighted cost. The closure claims success—"her work complete"—but the booklet's glow and the map's existence are asserted, not dramatized as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible price. No cost proof sentence is legible at the ending beat (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but "after the procedure" remains vague, never specifying when or how much time has elapsed, weakening temporal grounding (−0.3). The looped timelines are asserted rather than causally motivated; J-7 decides to "amalgamate" them tonight without prior failure or obstacle that would necessitate this attempt. Closure arrives as conceptual repricing (thoughts come from questioning and uniting fragments), but the cost is told rather than shown—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density via looped visions coalescing), but the final image does not reweight prior material through a concrete image or action; it delivers an abstract thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with investigation structure, but the core reversal—Marco's confession—arrives through coincidence (he emerges from shadows) rather than Elara's agency forcing it. The closure unit exists (mistrust thawed, artifact explained) but the cost is abstract and asserted ("freed by honesty") rather than legible in a decisive image or forfeited option. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when anchored by paragraph two). The investigation sequence relies on summary telling ("she pieced together") rather than dramatized discovery beats that narrow options with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or visible cost at closure; Elara's thesis is validated by convenience (vines curl, blossoms open) rather than earned struggle. The "mended deception" remains abstract—no on-page moment shows what the lie cost her or what she risked to correct it. Orientation is delayed: who she is and where she stands emerge gradually through exposition rather than anchored action. The drive lens reads as thematic accumulation, but the ending summarizes rather than reweights prior material with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Kael pulls the lever → hologram projects → equations resolve → validation occurs. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options; the demonstration succeeds on first attempt without complication. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance and wonder), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—what did Kael forfeit or risk to reach this moment? The before/after shift in their relationship and knowledge is present but feels delivered rather than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Elara explores, decodes stains, disrupts the water, and the ghost releases. Orientation anchors are present early (flooded opera house, orchestra pit musician, lanterns). The closure—ghost fading after she slaps the water—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (release from stagnant sorrow), but the cost is conceptual and implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. The causal chain is loose: water stains reveal notes, she disrupts stillness, ghost smiles and fades—each beat follows but doesn't tighten options in a way that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when early (Elara, mountain station, post-fever dawn) and pursues a coherent stake: confronting avoided truth about the Bloom's rarity. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts imperfection and updates her methods—but the cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt on the page. The midpoint unpinning and end re-pinning of the illustration provide structural symmetry, yet the causal chain between these acts consists largely of reflection: "she realized," "she saw," "she decided." Under an Accumulative/Textural lens (inferred from the lyric repetitions and thematic density), one meaningful deepening occurs when she correlates the flower's cycle to weather patterns, but this discovery is narrated in summary, not dramatized as a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens with clear linkage: tunnel exploration → valve discovery → radio confession → realization → symbolic closure. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (who/where/when anchored). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Kaelen reweights the "ghost shift" from supernatural to collective trauma—with the felt cost being the "immense weight" and "strange reverence." One meaningful deepening occurs when the radio confession transforms his understanding. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, and the final act (placing the valve) feels contemplative rather than decision-driven, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks an on-page closure unit with felt cost. The keeper walks to the refuge, sits, reflects, and returns unchanged; no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing occurs. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric-accumulative or situational?), never clarifying by closure, which caps Q2 at 7.2 and all others at 8.0 per cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no meaningful on-page closure: Leo's shift happens off-stage across years, and the final paragraph recycles the opening premise without cost or decisive change. Causality is absent—events are strung together by "and then" rather than "because/therefore" linkage. The eclipse session itself is decorative; nothing Leo or Elara does during totality alters options or forecloses a path with visible consequence. Orientation is delayed until line 11 (day of eclipse, oak setting), missing the ~120-word anchor gate, though spatial grounding eventually arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test passes narrowly—silo library, historian, post-human setting anchored early—but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: causal linkage is weak (diary fragments → tapestry code → device activation proceeds by declaration, not because/therefore pressure), and accumulative texture does not deepen or shift cadence to reweight the stake. The closure unit—"he had mended the rift in time itself"—is told rather than shown, with no on-page cost: Elian activates a device, hears stories, and the axis "settles into a new harmony" without visible forfeiture, relational loss, or tactical constraint paid. The "displaced axis" functions as thematic backdrop, not a problem that narrows options or forces a trade-off on the page, leaving no legible before/after in his situation or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early (lighthouse, Elara, after last orders), so no penalty applies. However, the piece offers outline-level sequencing—Elara encodes, Leo decodes, they meet, they expose secrets—without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis. The closure unit is announced ("transposed their lives") rather than landing as a visible change in options or stance with felt cost on the page. Inferred lens is weakly Causal, but key turns (Leo's arrival, the decision to collaborate) are narrated as summary rather than dramatized beats that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation arrives late—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract description, triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit (possession fragments under exposed assumption) reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains assertion rather than on-page consequence: no trade-off, forfeiture, or visible alteration in Elian's state. The lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered sound, color, silence build toward a conceptual collapse), but the final image ("simple, unadorned reality, secured") deflates rather than reweights prior pressure, and the cost is summary ("its form dissolving") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when by the opening lines and follows an accumulative texture: memories are charted, the nautilus guides, dawn approaches. However, no decisive on-page change or visible cost lands at closure; Elara completes her task and rests "content," but the reader cannot identify a before/after in stakes or stance. The ending offers affirmation without friction, failing the closure gate under any lens. Accumulative designs require at least a cadence shift or reweighting with cost; here the final image simply confirms what was declared at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece announces a stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—but never dramatizes what Kaelen loses or gains on the page; the closure ("stood whole") is asserted without visible cost. Orientation is vague: who, where, and when remain abstract past the 120-word threshold; "glowing viaduct," "timelines," and "procedural generation" are labels without spatial or causal grounding (Orientation Test penalty applied: −0.4). The inferred lens is murky—part causal (runes generate paths), part accumulative (cycling through timelines), yet the ending simply tells us integration occurred. No decisive change is shown; the tablet becomes "inert" and rain stops, but the before/after is not legible through dramatized action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (reawakening through backward vibration) with Elara's final teaching stance showing altered options, and the cost is visible in her journey from isolation to communion. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (cavern, Kael, Elara's deafness by line 4). The accumulative/textural lens holds through the phonograph experiment, building density via vibration-as-language. However, the final third multiplies declarative theme statements ("defeat emotional numbness was not about drowning out silence") that summarize rather than let the image speak, weakening the closure's resonance by ~0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story attempts a Causal lens but several links strain: the pigeon's arrival, the follower's identity, and the woman's sudden appearance at the gate feel coincidental rather than motivated by prior pressure. The closure unit—Elara learning that "integrity could flourish in communion"—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; no visible path is foreclosed. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalties, but the because/therefore chain weakens in the second half when external solutions (pigeon network, collaboration) resolve problems Elara's data alone could not.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-seeking, layered imagery, and a final reconfiguration where Elian channels his memories into the rope to free the beings. Closure lands on the page with cost (erasure of his past) and the texture-of-time realization crystallizes in the final beat. Orientation anchors quickly (grotto, starlight, rope). One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy beings' distress is recognized and Elian must choose. The causal link between rope-as-conduit and freedom is asserted rather than mechanically shown, relying on the reader to accept symbolic logic; this slight hand-wave keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is met. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara's final realization ("true beauty lies in the unfinished") is asserted rather than paid for through renunciation or foreclosed option. The "chronic hush" shifts from oppressive to companion via declaration, not dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the story cycles through nightly performances without a turn that narrows options or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who and where early (Elara, amber grotto, dusk) but lacks a causal sequence of because/therefore linkage. The transformation is repeated in summary loops ("the transformation completed" appears three times) rather than a single decisive turn with on-page cost. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration claim but the cost remains abstract—dropping the petal is gestural rather than a forfeiture that alters options. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but the pattern is not taught early; the static electricity method and blotter petal never constrain a choice or create friction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough, but the piece violates 600–800 word scope by covering weeks across multiple events and locations without teaching a mosaic pattern or maintaining a single contiguous window. The closure unit is diffuse: weeks of gatherings and cascading effects are summarized rather than landed in one decisive image with felt cost. The Drive Lens wobbles between Causal (mistaken envelope sparks investigation) and Accumulative (cycles of compassion ripple outward), never crystallizing at closure. Cost is asserted ("filling a void," "inspiring others") but not made visible in a final on-page moment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story orients adequately (who/where/when by ~150 words) and offers a Decisive Change (acceptance into community), but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains everything she wanted without meaningful sacrifice. The search-and-find structure reads as outline sequencing ("After days… One afternoon…") rather than because/therefore linkage. The arbor discovery is coincidental convenience rather than protagonist-driven causality, undercutting the earned quality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers poetic images and echoes "born" as a thematic motif. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara completes her task, smiles, returns home with "peace," and the world "resolves into harmony." The "aged her slightly" is summary-only and does not foreclose a path or reweight prior stakes on the page. Orientation is present early (rooftop canals, giant's nap timeframe, infinity pendant) so the Orientation Test is waived, but the ending offers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable pressure or felt price, failing the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard session builds density through ritual action (calibrating the eyes, observing patterns, recording data) that culminates in Lyra's image appearing and Elian's acceptance. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of mystery rather than solution), with the conceptual cost legible in his shift from desperation to curiosity. However, the turn feels more declared than dramatized—"Elian realized" summarizes rather than enacts the reweighting. The cost (abandoning the solve-it drive) is conceptual but muted, lacking a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes spatial anchors (library, crawl spaces, dawn) but never creates a meaningful tightening or reversal under any lens. Kaelen retrieves the tape without complication, plays it, and watches others respond—no decision narrows his options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The closure relies on telling us he "felt more visible than ever" rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration through action or image. Under a Causal lens, there is no because/therefore chain that escalates; under Accumulative, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake; the ending reports satisfaction without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (nursery owner under trellis during storm) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's shift from imposing control to observing flexibility, crystallized when she releases the leaf and chooses not to tie down the tree. The cost is legible—she forecloses her old methods and accepts vulnerability—qualifying as Earned Stasis with visible price. However, the midpoint restates the same realization multiple times without escalating pressure, and the because/therefore linkage between storm damage and her internal shift remains abstract. The closure lands but the path to it loops rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening moves and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen's insomnia-fueled isolation transforms into fragile connection with visible emotional cost (trading the brooch's private mystery for shared history). However, the escalation is largely reflective—"he realized," "he began to see"—rather than a because/therefore chain that narrows options through on-page pressure. The convergence of artifacts and the exchange with Elara feel more like accumulative atmosphere than causal tightening. Cost is present but diffuse; the exact sentence where the price is legible at closure is the painting exchange and the line "left them both feeling less alone," which reads more as relief than foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors adequately (pilgrim arrives at cave, Kaelen inside). The piece attempts a Causal lens but key turns feel coincidental: Elara's pure heart unlocks forces Kaelen overlooked, yet no prior scene dramatizes her purity beyond a brief memory of rain. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara becomes part of the cave, Kaelen accepts mystery), but the cost is abstract—"once troubled" shifts to "witness"—without a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. Causality is sketchy; the pearl amplifies magic because the plot needs it to, not because prior pressure narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments compile toward a ceremonial revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—the trumpet sounds, community bonds renew—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path accompanies the resolution. One tightening occurs (the logbook discovery), but the narrative remains linear accumulation without meaningful pressure or a decisive turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but causality is weak: the arrows "converge at a dead end" by coincidence, the doorway materializes without prior constraint, and the phantom punch solves each problem on demand without dramatized cost or trade-off. The closure unit—thrusting the punch into the sphere and emerging "renewed"—lacks felt consequence; the "inert" punch and vanished cracks erase all prior stakes rather than reweighting them. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the quest structure and tool-use), the because/therefore chain breaks repeatedly, and the ending offers summary transformation ("her own redemption") instead of a legible before/after with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test passes (who/where/when established early), but the closure unit lacks visible cost. Elara completes the transcription and shares it with villagers in a sequence of convenient successes without forfeiting anything or facing a genuine dilemma on the page. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural but the final "sculpted space" is asserted rather than charged through prior pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the whales migrate, she transcribes, villagers arrive, everyone finds peace—outline sequencing without felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, satisfying the gate. The drive lens reads as Causal early (amulet + storm → rift) but drifts toward Accumulative in the second half (intrigue deepens, whispers echo) without a taught pattern, creating ambiguity at closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (immortality feeling "terribly new") but the cost is told rather than shown on the page: "the amulet fragment gone" is summary, and we do not see what Kaelen forfeits or how his options narrow. One meaningful tightening occurs (the rift's pulse revealing it as trap/test) but linkage weakens when the fragment's "will of its own" introduces a late rule without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Leo, prep room, ink pot), but causality is fragile: the ink pot's "uncanny attribute" is asserted rather than discovered through dramatized trial, and its mechanism (staring into depths → ideas flow) never accrues cost or failure before the climax. The "solution crystallized" moment is a narrative shortcut—Leo's plan appears fully formed without on-page escalation or a narrowing choice that forecloses alternatives. The security chief's abrupt shift ("his tone shifting from stone to stream") constitutes a decisive change, but it is enacted by Leo's object and rhetoric rather than Leo's own stakes-altering choice, and the cost (asylum granted off-page) remains abstract. The lens reads as causal-intending but undercuts itself with convenience plotting: the chief arrives "for a routine check" precisely when needed, and the ink pot solves the breach without Leo risking his honesty or facing a genuine trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately but offers no on-page closure with cost. Elian performs his ritual, descends, and returns to repeat the cycle; the final paragraph summarizes his ongoing work without a decisive change, renunciation with visible price, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear orientation, but the ending ("his work was never done") summarizes stasis without felt cost or a moment that forecloses a path. Under an Accumulative lens, no cadence shift or density break charges the final image; under Causal, no because/therefore linkage narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers overheard fragments toward a final synthesis; the poison-bottle label acts as a causal key that focuses the search. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge reweighted), but cost is asserted ("painful story") rather than shown through a choice or forfeiture that narrows future options. Orientation is clear early. The accumulation pattern is coherent, but the closure image remains static—standing and knowing—without a visible price paid on the page, which limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with legible cost. Elara arrives at the observatory already defeated, plays cello, recounts past myth-busting in summary, and concludes with thematic assertions ("the riddle is you") that do not emerge from a decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing grounded in scene action. The orientation test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but no reversal or tightening narrows options—she simply restates her journey in reflective mode. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with felt cost at closure; the ending offers philosophical comfort without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Aqualia, Elara, pre-privatization carnival) land early. The drive lens reads Situational: corporate encroachment pressures Elara's stance, crystallized through graffiti as coded resistance. However, closure lacks a decisive change or visible cost on the page; the story ends with her walking away to "paint again tomorrow," which announces continuation rather than foreclosing a path. The final image (raft cradling foundation stone) offers thematic resonance but no legible shift in options or felt consequence—Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure reweighting the moment, and that pressure dissipates into hopeful intention rather than a cost paid now.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is immediate (crater inspector, Mons Huygens summit, lunar night). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through vials, grain, and dawn approach, culminating in the photograph. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara achieves her goal without sacrifice or renunciation; the "dawnlit melancholy" is asserted mood rather than a dramatized price. The chemical vials provide a countdown mechanism but no reversal or deepening alters her stance. One meaningful tightening (dawn's arrival) occurs, but the ending resolves to completion rather than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive quickly. The piece follows a causal sequence: drone broken → Elara diagnoses → patches → tests → success. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the patch "takes hold" without complication, and the test flight succeeds on first attempt. Closure lacks cost: the drone flies, the ship sails, Elara returns to her shop fulfilled—nothing is foreclosed, no price paid, no option narrowed. The ending delivers satisfaction without sacrifice, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (atlas editor, outpost, frozen lake, after falcon's return). Causality follows a causal lens: falcon brings token → condensation pattern matches phrasebook → Elias finds fissure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (discovery of the geothermal source) but the cost is underspecified—his worry about altering nothing is told rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible trade-off. The final beat ("further enigmas waiting") suggests continuation rather than a decisive reweighting, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates ritual actions—footsteps, tuning fork strikes, rhythm adjustments—but no single beat meaningfully tightens options or raises cost; each step adds texture without narrowing what Elian can do next. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the town revives, balance returns), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page sentence identifies what Elian sacrificed, risked, or lost to achieve this state. The final image ("faded into the dawn") gestures toward departure but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure (ticking clock). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first lines; no Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (captured hush + self-rescue realization) present on the page, but cost is conceptual and soft—surfacing with the vial feels like mission success rather than a path foreclosed. The because/therefore chain is clean (dwindling oxygen → careful mechanism work → door opens → hush captured → escape), yet the final paragraph's reflective summary ("he had become his own rescue") tells the reweighting rather than letting the image land it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (story-threading, mythic sustenance), but closure lacks felt cost—Kaelen weaves his truth and the labyrinth reshapes itself, granting escape without dramatized sacrifice or trade-off. Orientation is delayed; who/where/when coalesces only after ~150 words ("lighthouse prison," "three days prior"). The timeframe (bodies found "too late") deflates rather than tightens the stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (freedom via narrative integration), yet the hush and repose feel asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the bead's repeated presence and memory-charging function accumulates toward the final dissolution). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost bride's debt is settled, she dissolves into light, and Elian gains peace), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—her freedom is told, not shown through a forfeited option or visible price on the page. The bead warms and "its task complete" reads as exposition wrapping up stakes rather than an image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraphs, meeting the orientation test. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture (recurring "overlapping sleepwalking paths," "broken precedents," "orchid solace") yet also attempts causal progression (she sews, pathways form, the labyrinth awakens). At closure, no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost occurs on the page—Elara completes her task and walks out unchanged, the restoration asserted rather than earned through prior causality or a visible price. The "broken precedents mended" and "path from ruin to reverence" are told outcomes, not dramatized closure beats with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece attempts Accumulative pressure through repeated images (bones, roots, interrupted journeys) but lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Elara's discovery of the scrolls functions as a convenience resolution—the sundial points to the answer with no prior setup of this mechanism, no false leads, and no cost to the search. The closure unit (reading prayers aloud, achieving peace) is present on the page but the felt cost is absent: what path did she foreclose, what did she sacrifice or endure to earn this restoration? The final image asserts completion without demonstrating the price.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Situational (clandestine resistance work under surveillance pressure), but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs—Elara discovers no obstruction, makes no adaptation, and seals the letter as planned. The ending ("ready for the next challenge") is pure momentum statement without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; no felt cost appears on the page. The single mention of a suspected compromise ("Orion's identity might be compromised") is told in reflection and does not alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal: the embroidery work uncovers conspiracy fragments, the captain's lingering gaze creates discovery threat, and Elara's final act (extinguishing the candle) decisively shifts from listening to acting with visible cost (abandoning the eternal flame, plunging the dome into darkness). The closure is a Decisive Change that forecloses her prior method and signals open confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the captain's identity as conspirator crystallizes, narrowing her options and forcing the candle choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of poetic images and spirit messages accumulates toward the final release of unsent letters with conceptual repricing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening beats. The closure—Elara choosing forgiveness and releasing the letters—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis qualified by her renunciation of the prison she built), yet the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; the "unsent letters finally sent into the night, their power dissolved" is told as summary rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that forecloses a live path. One meaningful deepening occurs (spirit messages revealing Kaelen's fear, then the realization that the decision is hers), satisfying the length requirement, but the causal linkage between evocation, shard-healing, and final choice remains elliptical—evocation seems to summon messages but does not visibly narrow her options or force a trade-off until the ending declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the decryption beats layer meaning toward a final reweighting when the two-figures symbol is revealed. However, the entire sequence occurs in drugged memory without a present-frame constraint or cost that narrows options; the "completion" and catharsis are asserted in summary rather than dramatized as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page friction. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing (understanding as action), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than viscerally legible in a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through light-painting that projects ghostly images, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the fog "felt less like a prison and more like a canvas." Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the skeletal apple tree beat. Weakness: the closure unit lacks visible cost—Elara finds warmth and lighter steps, but no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The "promise of future displays" undercuts finality rather than crystallizing a stance with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what she wants remain vague past the opening third, though the garden anchors "where" early. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through recurrent motifs (coin, sound waves, nested awakenings), but closure is a Conceptual Repricing without legible cost—the mural heals itself and Elara watches, with no forfeited path or visible price. The "exchange" premise is asserted in summary ("exchanged a single truth for infinite wonder") rather than demonstrated through a causal turn or renunciation that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story opens with adequate anchors (who, where, when) but the causality is loose. The enforcers' arrival feels coincidental rather than earned by prior action, and the resolution—sound waves confuse scanners via "warping energy"—introduces a late-breaking rule without setup. The closure attempts Charged Poise ("her resolve sharper than ever") but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible option is foreclosed. The inferred lens is Situational (resistance under pressure), but the ending disperses rather than crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no clear inciting pressure, escalation, or decisive change—only a static poet in a shell across vague "centuries" until voices echo back and he feels "warmth." The claimed armistice outcome appears without causal linkage: no on-page action by the protagonist creates the returned lullabies or fields bursting into color. Orientation anchors (who, where, when in concrete terms) arrive late and remain hazy; the accumulative texture does not teach a coherent pattern by midpoint, and the ending delivers assertion ("Blossom armistice was no longer a dream") rather than a legible closure image with felt cost. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—the closure unit is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (opal library, Elara, caretaker ritual). Causality is mostly clean: crack threatens echoes → search for tablet → song heals chime. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara's "foxglove regret" is stated but not dramatically altered or deepened by the success. The ending restates her vigil without a decisive change in her stance or a visible price paid, landing as summary rather than a moment that reweights prior material. Lens reads Causal with a weak RR attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: each promise triggers a glyph response, building toward revelation. However, the escalation is mechanical rather than motivated—no genuine obstacle tests Elara's method, and Kaelen's arrival at the exact moment of completion reads as coincidental resolution rather than earned convergence. The closure (trust restored) occurs on the page but the cost is abstract; we don't see what Elara risked or lost in the process. Orientation is clean early.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines; the piece holds a single POV across one continuous scene in the amphitheater. The closure—Elara's subtle recalibration that harmonizes utility and reverence—lands on the page, yet the cost remains abstract: "slyly heartfelt adjustments" are told rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or visible consequence. The inferred lens is Causal with an Accumulative tilt (the breathing cycles accumulate meaning), but the final image of balance and joy does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and why she trains pigeons remains abstract until paragraph 19. The inciting incident (Leo's arrival) occurs halfway through, leaving no room for escalation. Leo's discovery of the letter is coincidental convenience that solves rather than complicates; the meteorite's micro-engravings appear as a retroactive patch with no prior setup. Closure declares emotional change ("learning to trust and love again") but shows no decisive on-page cost or foreclosed path; the ending summarizes partnership and mission rather than landing a felt reversal or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation or reversal occurs; Elara examines wood grain, correlates it with the logbook, and arrives at insight without opposition or cost. The "butterfly effect" premise remains decorative worldbuilding never causally linked to her present choices. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague through the opening paragraphs. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("necessary distances weren't voids but bridges") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized, and no before/after options are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the piece follows a single continuous night in one location. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. Elara's realization that "belonging is a rhythm we dance to" is an asserted epiphany, not a choice that forecloses a path or alters tactics. The ending is a summary of theme rather than a moment where options narrow or meaning reweights with undeniable pressure. Closure form fails the required test.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the ending lacks cost—Kaelen simply understands and smiles, experiencing no loss, forfeiture, or reconfiguration that changes his options. The "discovery" is told rather than dramatized: "paths disappear when their emotional foundations are sacrificed" arrives via exposition, not scene pressure. Orientation is delayed (who/what/where emerges slowly across the first 150 words) but eventually legible; apply −0.3. No meaningful tightening occurs; the protagonist moves from gathering to understanding without obstacles or trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (tidal arcade, Elara, evening performance). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and reflections to build a portrait of Elara's method, with a quiet cadence shift at the end when she returns ready to repeat. However, no meaningful closure occurs—the story ends exactly where it began, with Elara preparing another performance, and no visible cost or path foreclosure. The final paragraph ("tomorrow would bring another chance to order randomness into joy") confirms the loop without transformation. The bishop's warmth and her smile are asserted emotional states, not decisive changes in options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who and where early enough, but causality is nearly absent: Elara begins a ritual, completes it without obstacle or reversal, and collapses in satisfaction. No meaningful tightening occurs; the "agonizing yet exquisite" process is asserted, not dramatized through setback or forced adaptation. The nostalgia ban functions as thematic backdrop rather than a live constraint that narrows her options. Closure reads as a mood statement ("she was whole") rather than a decisive change with felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (harbor glazier, Pearl Bay, dawn before dredging project). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist → atrium → pond ritual → sun breakthrough. However, the closure unit—a resonant reconfiguration where Elara "understands" change as natural propagation—lacks visible or felt cost on the page. The final line ("She smiled, ready for whatever came next") asserts resolution without dramatizing a forfeited path or a crystallized choice. The inferred lens holds, but the ending delivers thematic summary rather than a legible price or stance shift that makes a before/after undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, when are anchored early; no penalty. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural (meditation, reflection, pattern). However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page. Elara begins seeking enlightenment and ends "lighter for having shared its story with the stars," but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no before/after legible with felt cost. The closure remains aspirational summary rather than an on-page shift that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but when remains vague ("this cycle"). The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara releases balloons, reads the gauge, adjusts patterns, and observes effects across timelines. However, the closure—placing a final pearl and reading the gauge in the green—feels declarative rather than earned by prior causal pressure; the story tells us "a serene upheaval washed through" without dramatizing the cost or showing a before/after shift in Elara's stance or options. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) is asserted but not legible on the page with felt cost. The sequence is because/therefore within her ritual but lacks a tightening that narrows her choices or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: density increases as Elara moves deeper, discovers the diaries, reads the negative strip, and pieces together the scientist's story. However, the closure unit—her decision to document and carry the burden—lacks a decisive turn or visible cost; she smiles and walks on with purpose but no path is foreclosed and no tactic altered. The inferred lens holds, but the ending offers declaration ("she would ensure") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is present early (terrace, spring, waiting for bells), but no causal linkage drives the narrative—each sentence adds descriptive texture without because/therefore pressure. The closure unit is a passive fadeout: "the mirages held for a breath longer" then Lyra departs with "her work complete," offering no decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration of prior stakes. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in method but delivers no pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Inferred lens: Accumulative, but closure does not land with cost under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure—Elara fading into light as peace is forged—lands on the page, but the cost is told rather than dramatized: "her strength waned, her body growing lighter" reads as summary of a process we don't witness in scene. The lens is situational (ritual pressure forces stance crystallization), but the final image doesn't reconfigure prior material; it confirms what was narrated from the start. The peace requiring "continued effort" is asserted in epilogue summary, not felt in a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes who and where by ~80 words (passing the Orientation Test), but the closure unit—releasing the echo—operates through unexplained metaphysics: the egg "seemed" to emit light and the echo "flowed into the cracks" without prior setup of how this works or what obstacle it overcomes. The "map drawn by cracks" guides him to a starburst epicenter, yet no choice between paths or cost of following this map appears on the page; he simply arrives. Lens is Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and echo motif), but the final image asserts transformation ("acknowledged the cost," "unburdened") rather than showing a before/after change in options or knowledge. Cost is declared ("cost of his ambition") but not demonstrated in a forfeited path or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear goal (unlock the sanctuary) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change (she steps back transformed), but causality is thin: untangling threads releases chimes and voices, then the sanctuary simply "materializes" without meaningful resistance or cost-bearing choice. The escalation from kneeling to tracing to pulling a final thread reads as procedural steps rather than because/therefore pressure. Orientation is prompt (courtyard, Elara, tonight) but the mechanics of the prism sanctuary remain metaphorical convenience rather than earned discovery. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, as the piece accumulates echoes and images toward a final reconfiguration, but the reconfiguration lacks felt cost—no on-page price paid for defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change occurs on the page; the piece ends with Elara packing materials and walking out with "peace" already achieved in reflection. The argument with Marco is backstory; the dome scene is static contemplation punctuated by summary intentions ("she would return," "she planned"). Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first third without urgency, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure (−0.4). The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is undercut by the absence of a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending asserts readiness without on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elian prepares, builds, waits, witnesses, releases. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he completes his homage and descends—but the cost remains abstract ("transiently rooted no more"). The orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the butterfly brushes the moth wing, reweighting the gesture, but the change in options or stance is faint; the piece accumulates atmosphere more than it tightens choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test is satisfied (who/where/when established early), and the accumulative lens is inferrable by midpoint. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elara succeeds without forfeiting anything, and the rope transformation occurs through smooth execution rather than through a tightening that narrows options. The "street organ scrap crumbled to dust" arrives as convenient erasure rather than felt sacrifice. Under an accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material with pressure, but instead it delivers triumph without friction or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative building to a conceptual turn). Orientation anchors arrive early (bunker, storm, protagonist). The closure—stepping through the gateway and merging with the path—occurs on the page, but the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized: what exactly does she forfeit by transcending "keeper" to "part of the flow"? The wafer seal dissolution and wall-shimmer provide physical markers, yet the emotional or relational price remains abstract. One meaningful deepening is present (dream interpretation → realization → gateway), meeting minimum scope, but the resonance lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story provides early spatial anchors (palace, observatory) and a ceremonial sequence, but causality remains thin: Aris's tile placement triggers a voice and then "seals a covenant" without meaningful obstacle or tightening of options. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (devotion = universe itself, encrypted in math/art) that reweights the premise, yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. Under a Causal lens the because/therefore chain is weak; under Accumulative the final image reconfigures but without felt price, landing the piece in mid-functional range.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure attempts a Decisive Change (Kael releases resentment) but the turn is told rather than earned through on-page causal pressure. The cylinder "repairs itself" symbolically, not through Kael's agency. Orientation is delayed—who Kael is and what he's angry about remains abstract past the 120-word mark. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (repeated mentions of shifting grace, cellular memory) and Causal without committing, and no meaningful cost appears on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fog, mirrors, twilight frost building to a final reweighted image), but the ending substitutes a tidy capture and retreat rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The claimed transformation ("left him changed") is told in summary, and the new hope in the final line is generic rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material. Closure form fails the cost-proof test: no exact sentence at the ending beat shows visible, felt, or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit—Lyra's return and their reconciliation—occurs after a "weeks passed" ellipsis that elides the escalation; the critical reversal happens off-page. Orientation is present by the second paragraph, but causality is weak: Elara crafts quartz eyes and leaves them on an altar, then weeks later Lyra conveniently appears holding the box with full understanding. The journal's "deciduous vows" passages provide the insight, but the protagonist's agency at closure is passive—she waits, then embraces. No visible cost forecloses a path; the breach is healed without sacrifice. The drive lens appears Causal but collapses into summary and coincidence at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through the orchard's shimmering responses and Elara's layered inquiries, but the closure—placing the cameo back—lacks a decisive before/after that reweights options with visible cost. The final image offers thematic resolution ("curate, not conquer") but does not land a felt price or foreclose a path on the page; Elara's journey reads as philosophical arrival rather than stakes-altering reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is hybrid causal-accumulative: the diary decode → floating books → doorway sequence follows because/therefore linkage, while the "unheard symphony" motif and meditation pause gesture at textural deepening. Orientation anchors arrive late (the Glimmering Stack's nature and spatial logic remain vague until midpoint), triggering a −0.4 penalty. Closure lands on-page—Kael reads the book, the timeline heals—but the cost is asserted in summary ("the library was now a part of her, its lessons silently echoing") rather than felt in the final image. The constraint (library shifts based on seeker's intentions) shapes one turn but is introduced and resolved within a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with vivid anchors (fog, carnival ship, bay) but orientation wavers: who Elara is and what "chimera twin discoverer" means remain abstract past the 120-word mark, costing −0.4. The closure unit—seeing the garden as "a tapestry of light and sound"—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("unkindled solace finally kindled") rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or trade-off. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric-accumulative patterns suggest Textural, but the quest frame implies Causal); this ambiguity persists at closure, triggering an additional −0.4 and capping Q2 at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: door appears → seal unlocks → rope reconfiguration → void stabilizes. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (absence filled, diplomat completes his signature), and cost is implied in the permanence of the bridged years. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant; we do not see what Elara forfeits or how her present stance shifts. The ending tells us "the complex made clear" rather than showing a before/after in her own options or knowledge. Orientation anchors early (archivist, clock tower, tonight), satisfying the test.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through expanding "bloom of hush" and cave harmonics stabilizing into new pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: peace forged through struggle), but the cost remains vague ("exhausted but fulfilled") rather than a specific forfeiture or visible trade-off on the page. Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/stakes). One meaningful deepening occurs (energy beings shift from chaotic to cooperative), but the final image—Elara walking away, leaving the stone—lands softly without sharp conceptual or felt cost that the reader can point to in a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens—Elara gathers fragments, tracks star paths, aligns the prism—and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when the beacon ignites. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the escalation is smooth and uncontested: no reversal narrows options, no obstacle forces a trade-off, and Vega's zenith arrival reads as convenient timing rather than earned pressure. The closure image is present but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("she had ignited a belief") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist moves through three monuments, each offering whispers that deepen his understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure moment—"he had sculpted his identity not from stone, but from the echoes of experience"—asserts conceptual repricing but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or renunciation demonstrates what was foreclosed. The solid fog "began to shimmer" in response to his thought, a convenience that undercuts earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesces only after ~150 words of chant and metaphor, triggering a −0.4 penalty and the Q3=7.0 cap. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (chant → mosaic → fireworks), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elian encounters no resistance, makes no adjustment, and the fireworks simply execute as planned. Closure lacks felt cost: the "gravity of hopelessness" lifts off-page for "unseen watchers," and Elian's own stakes remain abstract. The mosaic note "reveals itself" without prior groundwork that made discovery conditional on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (grotto, Elara, Kael, stars). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (cicada, hermit crab, pools) and reflection layers build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in which Elara reframes leaving as transformation rather than abandonment. The closure is legible—she achieves clarity and they walk from the grotto—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture, no tactical constraint overcome on the page. The "difficult conversation" pauses and resumes "transformed," yet we never see what Elara or Kael concretely gives up or what option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the third paragraph (bunker, father, Elara, gravity inversion imminent). The drive lens reads Causal with elements of Accumulative (the "flavors of silence" collection). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bunker "felt just a little less like a prison"), but the cost is conceptual rather than visible—no on-page sacrifice or forfeited option materializes in the ending beat. The inversion window provides external pressure, yet the vial's capture proceeds without complication, flattening escalation and undermining cost legibility at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who and where within the opening lines (Elara, gondola, prism terrace), satisfying orientation. However, no meaningful causal chain or tightening emerges: Elara begins monitoring silence, continues monitoring silence, and ends monitoring silence with no reversal, deepening, or narrowed options. The claimed transformation—"silence was a comfort"—is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a visible choice or cost. Under any drive lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), the ending reconfigures nothing on the page, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The dominant stake—claim the throne before sunrise—is signaled early, but escalation is largely geographic transit rather than causal tightening. The closure unit (sitting on the throne, holographic displays activating) occurs on the page but the cost is declared rather than felt: "weight of responsibility but also joy" is label-speak without a visible forfeiture or reconfigured option. The piece reads as a causal-accumulative hybrid, but the lens wavers between quest-completion and lyric reprise without committing to either at closure, and no persistent constraint shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the keeper is, where exactly he stands, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—two people breathing together—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (expansion of sanctuary) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (poetic density), but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt cost, only declares hope without dramatizing the price of re-connection.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as causal but the climax breaks causality: the bolt-to-diamond transformation is resolved by willpower and convenient dimensional messages rather than earned protagonist agency. The "Now" text triggers the change, making Leo a passive conduit. Orientation is delayed—character, setting, and stakes aren't anchored until ~15% in. Closure occurs (a physical change) but the cost is declared ("weight of his past truly gone") rather than felt through forfeited options or visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague—who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The closure unit is told rather than shown: "hidden truth was now uncovered" summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive change, and no visible cost appears on the page to validate the transformation. The gramophone's "standing waves" create a "bridge of intuition" through assertion, not causal progression. The lens is ambiguous (neither Causal linkage nor Accumulative pattern is legibly taught), and the ending declares change without proving it through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Alaric is and what the orchard's rules are remain vague past the opening third, though spatial anchors (greenhouse, bench, trees) appear early enough to avoid a full penalty. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered mystical imagery, but the closure unit is weak: the orb of possibility materializes without on-page cost or a choice that forecloses a path; the program crumbles conveniently, and Alaric's doubt "unsnaps" via assertion rather than dramatized renunciation. No meaningful escalation tightens options—each beat adds texture but does not narrow tactics or raise stakes. The "capture" succeeds on first attempt with no friction, and the final image reconfigures little beyond restating the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara unfurls archival layers, building density through discovered letters and cross-references until the ending reweights her heartbreak via the Jonah-Miller kindness. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the file room "once a place of sorrow, now hummed with... stories waiting to be unfurled"), but cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible—what path does peace foreclose? The dust-pattern method and veteran's archive research provide causal links, yet the final paragraph moralizes theme ("dust would continue to accumulate, but now it would tell stories of hope, not neglect") instead of landing on a charged image that makes cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—"the city's vast library" and "urban outskirts" remain placeholders past the 120-word threshold without grounding who/where/when concretely, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The drive lens is ambiguous: the puddle-map and auric lagoon suggest situational pressure, but Kael's actions follow a linear fetch-quest with no narrowing of options or live cost at closure. The "final stand" is asserted but not dramatized; ghostly historians deliver revised histories without Kael sacrificing a live alternative or facing a credible obstacle. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, when by the opening paragraphs) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern, ritual repetition, and atmospheric density build toward a moment of achieved stasis. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Elias completes the ritual, the prophecy is hushed temporarily, and he accepts the cyclical burden—but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than dramatized on the page. The phrase "vested hush prevailed" and "legacy" are thematic declarations rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The escalation is a single sustained pressure rather than a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options, satisfying the Accumulative lens minimally but without a decisive image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a clear closure unit with felt cost: Elara decodes leaves, builds monuments, and the arbor greens, but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the ending recounts her ongoing cycle without a before/after that forecloses options. Causality is decorative rather than motivated: the moonstone speck appears, is placed, and effects follow without obstacle or choice that narrows her path. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage, accumulative density shift, nor situational crystallization dominates—and the final paragraph summarizes her legacy rather than landing a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—the workshop, unease, and admiral's compass exposition consume the opening third without clear spatial or temporal grounding. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara returns transformed, hangs the compass), but the cost is conceptual and stated ("beneath the ashes of her old self") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice. Causal linkage from greenhouse key to cave to grotto reads as conveniences aligning rather than because/therefore pressure, and the compass "pointing into shadows" as guide feels like mechanical plot service rather than motivated escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the alchemical exploration and kintsugi repair, culminating in a cadence shift when the gold-veined coin glows with "internal light." Orientation anchors cleanly (alchemist, rain-washed foundry, after the search disbands). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the coin transforms from a failed tool to "a testament to the search itself," and Elara's regret becomes "luminous peace." Cost is conceptually legible—the coin is fractured, the search abandoned—but the emotional or tactical price remains diffuse; the final image reweights prior material without a sharp before/after in Elara's options or stance beyond the meditation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative decoration (recurring "luminous ache," harp notes). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4, waiving the penalty. However, no meaningful because/therefore linkage tightens options: Elara sets the harp, Lyra appears, Elara asks for joy, Lyra laughs, soul dissipates—each step is narrated consecutively without opposition or cost that narrows tactics. The closure unit (Lyra's laughter dissolving pain, lines 19–22) reads as Decisive Change under Causal lens, but the cost is asserted ("pain dissolved") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price Elara pays. The final paragraph loops opening phrases without reweighting them, diluting closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: repeated bracing, trauma-response anchors, and the ultraviolet forest motif build toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—Kaelen realizes mercy is "the interruption of a cycle"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeit or tactical shift occurs on the page. The strap discovery feels seeded for thematic payoff rather than earned by causal pressure, and the final stance does not foreclose a live option with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story orients who and where early (Elara, alchemist's market) and establishes a causal chain: she seeks painting → finds it → vision triggers → she returns with intent to document. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara's situation at the end is identical to the opening except for possessing knowledge she will "document." No path is foreclosed, no price paid, no option reweighted with felt consequence. The vision sequence is a receiving event, not a choice-driven reversal. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image ("anchors of intuition held fast") repeats the opening frame without meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative lens: dust patterns, hidden compartment, and gathering ghost stories build toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first ~100 words. The closure—Leo's promise to honor the clockmaker and the ghosts fading—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he accepts his role), but the cost remains abstract ("weightless burden now a quiet pride") rather than showing a foreclosed option or visible trade-off on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of ledgers and ghost backstories), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (frost patterns, bottled whisper, glass orchard) toward a closure moment. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, though "after reality became negotiable" remains vague as a when-anchor. The rupture at line 16 functions as a decisive event, but the closure disperses into summary mode ("became a weaver," "her work continued") rather than landing a single charged image or renunciation with visible cost. The final cost—library instability—is told rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes Elara's goal (reimagine the civilization) and tests it through the storm experiment, delivering a Decisive Change when holographic images validate her theory and she compiles a treatise. However, the closure moment—"she found peace in having reignited a spark of creativity"—summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost; we're told she remains "defunct" but don't see what specific option or relationship she forecloses to achieve this peace. Orientation is clear early (baroque asteroid, visible time, archaeological dispute), and the causal chain holds under a largely Causal lens, but the final beat lacks the on-page felt cost required for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "resonance chamber" and "midnight" remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The covenant wilting when the townsman lies provides one micro turn, but the resolution—man confesses, song strengthens, light returns—unfolds in a single unbroken causal chain with no felt cost or foreclosed path on the page. The ending offers Decisive Change (light reclaimed) but the price is externalized to the townsman's confession rather than Elian's sacrifice or trade-off, weakening closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening paragraph). The piece follows a clear descent-and-discovery arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered psychometry, the lagoon's stillness, and the final reweighting of petrichor from collectible to presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (she leaves the compass, accepts the ineffable, carries memory instead of vials) with visible cost—her vocation is renounced. One minor causality question: the compass needle spinning to point "into the heart of the water" feels convenient rather than earned by prior rules, slightly weakening the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by paragraph two). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: archway hum → slide discovery → projection viewing → carving → completion. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she joins the chain of makers, her "true coordinates" internalized), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page action she must renounce, no relationship or resource spent. The GPS flickers back and she ignores it, a told gesture without visible weight. The slide "dims, its purpose fulfilled" by authorial fiat rather than Elara's sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (postcards, cathedral glass, night flowers) toward a thematic realization. Orientation anchors arrive early (Elara, pavilion, autumn). However, closure operates as conceptual repricing without felt cost—Elara simply "understood" and walks home with "heart light." The cathedral discovery (hidden glass reveals night flowers) functions as information delivery rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; the "reckoning" remains abstract, and the final image ("her mural stood as testament") asserts meaning rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    The retrocognitive vision provides the dominant frame, but causality is weak: Elara arranges debris and the diary simply unlocks without meaningful resistance or cost that forecloses options. The closure—sitting quietly with resolved findings—lacks a decisive change or visible price; her "resolve to share" is declared intention, not on-page action with stakes. The vision dissolves automatically rather than through protagonist agency. Orientation is delayed (zeppelin library context arrives late, lagoon mechanics unclear until midpoint).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive early, waiving that penalty. However, the piece operates as extended summary rather than scene; the entire "revival" unfolds in past-tense narration ("He began gathering materials," "He taught the few returning settlers") with no single dramatized beat where Elian faces a concrete obstacle, makes a choice, and pays a price. The ending asserts that the town thrived and Elian found community, but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page with legible cost—only thematic summary. Drive lens is indeterminate; the text reads as summary-driven rather than Causal, Accumulative, or Situational.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the phonograph captures layered sound, a new voice emerges, Elian adds the prophecy to his archive. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—his archival work now aims to predict destiny—but the cost remains abstract ("weight of the accidental prophecy") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The causal link between recording in the garden and the voice's emergence feels coincidental rather than earned by prior rule-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early (icebound atrium, starlight, egg about to hatch). Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through ritual imagery and recurring phrases toward a portal-opening climax. Closure unit: Elara steps through the reopened gateway (Decisive Change), but the cost is abstract ("journey had only just begun") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that reweights prior material. The causal chain (egg hatches → vortex emerges → acorn cap stabilizes → portal opens) functions mechanically but lacks a tightening that narrows options or forces a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors late (~150 words before "windblown sanctuary" and "storm siren tester" coalesce clearly); apply −0.3 for delayed spatial/role clarity. The switch from siren to bell constitutes a Decisive Change, and the villagers' preparation shows cost, but the closure moment itself—"After the glue dried, everything held together"—leans toward summary rather than a charged final image. The causal chain (microclimate data → bell pull →村 preparation) holds, but the ending diffuses into reflective recap rather than landing a single resonant beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost. Kael arrives already enlightened and simply confirms his state through observation; no decisive change, renunciation, or foreclosed path appears. The story is a static meditation with no causal pressure: watching stars → feeling connection → continuing to sweep. The orientation test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but the accumulative lens never tightens or reweights the dominant stake. The final paragraph ("cosmic janitor had become a star") is declarative summary, not a resonant image that reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the beekeeping oasis context and ghost visibility timeframe emerge piecemeal across the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (ghosts dissolve, oasis revives), but the cost is asserted—"their silence lingered"—rather than shown through a forfeited choice or tactic shift. The drive lens hovers between Accumulative (mood-driven) and Causal (covenant → box → release), but causality remains vague: why does opening an empty box untangle the covenant? The link is thematic decoration, not motivated action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; we learn "emerald silo" and "after the Great Shift" but remain unclear on concrete who/where/when anchors. The closure unit—Elara's realization that "time's texture was not in its measure, but in its experience"—is told rather than shown through a decisive change or visible cost. The drive lens wavers between accumulative (texture, atmosphere) and causal (the stranger's arrival solves the mystery), never stabilizing. Leo's arrival and the micro-engraved equation resolve the central mystery via exposition, not protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the closure effect is a Conceptual Repricing without legible cost—the poet's core belief is affirmed rather than tested or reweighted. The kite incident functions as illustration, not reversal; the protagonist encounters a moment that supports his existing philosophy and leaves unchanged. No foreclosed path or felt price appears on the page. The ending recapitulates the opening stance in slightly varied phrasing, creating a circular confirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and teaches a pattern of copper-oak-pillar iterations that deepen interspecies connection. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Elara's final entry and her seated death in the remodeled orchard with the legacy intact—but the cost remains primarily asserted ("body growing weaker") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that alters her final days. The escalation reads as density increase (repeated wiring, stone response, fauna changes) with one meaningful deepening when the stag bows, yet no on-page moment forces a trade-off or narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Elara designs a pilgrimage, follows footprints, places the amber, and receives a holographic revelation. Orientation anchors who and where by the tower paragraph (~200 words), acceptable under the window. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"home was not a place but a chemical memory"—but the cost is implied rather than on-page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical shift occurs, and the final walk back feels like affirmation rather than a decisive change. The lens holds, but the closure lacks felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (character role and location emerge gradually across the first 6 lines) and the dominant stake—garden reclamation—is stated rather than tested. The piece operates in a summary-accumulative mode: the coachman works, scatters seeds, and departs, but no reversal or deepening narrows his options. The ending offers Earned Stasis (he has completed the task and departs), yet the cost is asserted ("wounds of the earth") rather than felt on the page. The drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (lyric density) and Causal (planting seeds to restore life), never fully committing to either, and closure reads as atmospheric summary rather than a decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the phonograph attempt gathers density through the leaf-overlay epiphany, culminating in coordinates that reweight "distance into closeness" from emotional longing to physical journey. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the walk begins with the gap bridged internally, options crystallized, cost visible (leaving cabin, entering wasteland). One causal knot: the leaf's function as "lens" is asserted poetically rather than dramatized through failed attempts, slightly weakening the turn's necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Kaelen faces isolation and silence, uses a family custom to find direction, and crystallizes a plan to journey toward the star. Orientation anchors arrive early (observation deck, post-shutdown, solitary vigil). However, the closure lacks visible cost on the page—his departure reads as fulfillment rather than renunciation, and no prior option is demonstrably foreclosed. The ending offers Charged Poise potential but the cost remains implicit rather than legible in a specific image or action, preventing entry into the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal chain: climb → arrive → swap pieces → place sundial lid → sky mends. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Kaelen retrieves the white queen and descends, the world "unaware," with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. The ritual succeeds exactly as planned without complication, making the ending a completion rather than a transformation. Orientation is clear early (icebound spire, wrong sky, Kaelen climbing), and the lens holds as causal, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—words spelled by footsteps and echoing gallery acoustics accumulate toward a final pattern ("peace"). Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what the interregnum entails remain vague past the ~120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (healing via pattern completion), but the cost is asserted ("heart lighter") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. The pawn-less chessboard and walking motifs recur but never constrain a choice or narrow options. Linkage is thematic accumulation without causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to acceptance), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—"painful remembering softened into acceptance" summarizes rather than dramatizes the forfeiture or trade-off. The nightly sessions accumulate density, but the final turn lacks a sharp image or action that makes the before/after legible with undeniable pressure. Causality within the accumulative frame holds, yet the ending drifts into thematic summary rather than landing a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The story follows a causal lens: Elian decodes the tapestry, applies the solution to the labyrinth, and achieves internal release. However, the closure effect—"he forgave himself and chose to move forward"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete choice or image that reweights prior material. The cost (exile, shame) is backstory; no on-page forfeiture or alteration of present options occurs. The ending tells us redemption happened rather than showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered echoes and refractive repetition. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the pattern is taught and the final image (multiplied truths in the air) achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and stated ("it was not a single act, but a lifetime") rather than dramatized on the page through a visible forfeiture or changed stance, and the bell's urgency never tightens options in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure arrives as a Decisive Change (memories quilted together, hope rekindled), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"exhausted but fulfilled" tells the price without showing what Elian forfeited or what path closed. The causal lens holds: descent → charm alignment → memory narration → surfacing, but each step feels preordained with no meaningful tightening or narrowing of options. The statue crumbles on cue, the charm glows, and success is delivered without friction. One continuous scene is maintained, but the escalation is mechanical rather than earned by protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The wrong-turn discovery → painted shell → realization sequence builds coherent pressure and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she places the shell back, foreclosing the nostalgic grip with visible cost). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. The closure image (cracked mirror becomes "new pattern") reweights prior material, though the cost could be more viscerally immediate rather than reflected upon.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a clear causal chain: heat breaks → Elara enacts ritual → brother feels pull → changes course. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (the brother's course correction) paired with Elara's felt confirmation, and the cost is legible as her year of waiting and the risk that the whisper might fail. However, the brother's response feels convenient—he smells the garden and "knows" without dramatized friction or doubt—undercutting the earned quality of the turn. The inferred lens is Causal, held consistently, but the brother's段 lacks motivated resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through ritual assembly and lunar-keyed intensification toward a final image that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to grief. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the station shifts from prison to sanctuary, grief becomes "charted map"), but cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible on the page—no specific forfeiture or trade-off anchors the transformation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening beat), but the accumulative pressure lacks a decisive tightening or sacrifice that would make the "before/after" undeniably felt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world detail and backstory toward a ritual closure; the glass-eye charging and ritual constitute an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the occlusion creates a new barrier, forecloses involuntary speech, and the cost—unknown but stated—is felt). Orientation is clear by paragraph one. The causality is thin: Elara waits, performs, succeeds without complication or reversal. No meaningful escalation tightens options; the storm peak arrival feels convenient rather than motivated by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details, remembered fragments, and the recurring Edelweiss build density toward a final reconfiguration where Elias accepts solitude as "a choice." Orientation is clear (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he chooses reflective solitude and mails the letter as symbolic completion). Cost is implied—he releases the borrowed memories and accepts isolation—but the final image ("Elias smiled") does not make that cost viscerally felt on the page; the ending tilts toward affirming mood rather than undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (glimmers, rising creek as timeframe), but closure steps back into thematic summary rather than a decisive on-page act or image that reweights prior material with visible cost. The doorway fades when he steps back, yet the final beat ("no longer lonely but resolved") tells the change rather than showing forfeiture or a charged moment that makes the cost undeniable. Orientation is prompt (~120 words) with shop, Mara's vow, midsummer timeframe. The ants-to-cavern sequence coheres causally, but the climactic choice at the archway deflates into acceptance-statement rather than a scene beat where options narrow or a relationship to the promise visibly alters.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a quest structure with clear spatial progression (palace → ridge → grotto) and the bleeding starlight mystery seeds early expectation. However, the closure relies on a voice-over epiphany ("You have come to understand the balance") rather than a decisive action or renunciation that changes Elara's options on the page. The cost of revelation is asserted in the final paragraphs but not dramatized through a concrete trade-off or foreclosed path, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the nexus awakens, Elara becomes "guardian of moments"), but the cost is conceptual only—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or visible consequence that alters her path forward. Causality is weak: Kael's revelation ("it's dreaming") instantly shifts Elara's understanding without resistance, and her subsequent actions (channeling energy, releasing it transformed) proceed without obstacles or failed attempts. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (palette shifts, nexus pulses, twilight deepens), yet the final intensification lacks a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (lucid dream chronicler), where (mountain ranger cabin), and when (after seeing own grave) by ~15% of text. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (grave, soaring, past selves, scroll), and the final act—filling the scroll with symbols and accepting the grave as "just another part of the story"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where chronicling the chaos forecloses panic with felt relief ("the weight had lifted, just a little"). The cost is legible: endurance of grim knowledge and acceptance of imperfect narrative. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dream-soaring returns him to the cabin and he commits to marking the scroll despite disorientation. Minor slip: the causal link between "filling the scroll" and emotional shift could be tighter; we see the act but the mechanics of relief feel slightly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear closure unit. Elara receives metaphorical advice, then the text summarizes her later practice in general terms without dramatizing a single encounter that narrows options or imposes cost. The woman's grief scene is recounted, not shown. Orientation is present early, but causality dissolves into summary after the shop visit, and no before/after change is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece attempts to build pressure through layered reflection and metaphor, but causality remains loose—scars "transform" via repeated declaration rather than through dramatized actions that narrow options. Orientation is clear (floating platform, tea ceremony, rune-scholar). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she completes the ceremony and "discovers the power to transform"), but the cost is asserted ("shed the last of her crystallized doubts") rather than made visceral on the page. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; anchors are present early.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and ritual build toward a reconciliation image that reweights the haunting. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the word "forgiven" and the softened melody), with felt cost in the orchard's imminent destruction and Alistair's sorrow. However, Isabella's forgiveness arrives via deus-ex-blossom rather than through dramatized resistance or complication, undercutting the cost's bite. The because/therefore linkage is present but soft: Elara's device works as intended without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where anchored, but "when" remains abstract throughout), triggering the test penalty. No legible drive lens emerges by midpoint: the piece cycles through repeated synonym statements ("unraveling," "unifying," "dissolving") without causal linkage or accumulative deepening. The ending asserts transformation ("cosmic illusions were unraveled") but offers no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost—only declarative summary that reality now "stood pure and bright."

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly, but no causal escalation occurs—the shepherd performs a ritual, counts, observes, then declares an epiphany. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing ("clocks measure the human desire to carve permanence from flux"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in method but never tightens or deepens pressure, violating its own lens at closure. Applying the Cost proof test: no sentence in the ending demonstrates a visible, felt, or social price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is beyond "daughter" and where she begins (subway? home?) remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—deciding to teach—is told in summary ("Elara decided to teach others") without a scene that dramatizes the choice or its cost. The causal lens is undercut by coincidence: cryptic scrawls conveniently point to the library where her father's journal waits, resolving a problem the scrawls did not help create. No visible cost at the ending; the lantern swings as symbol, not constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (subway tunnel, phone booth operator, night) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift in perspective via the "loop." However, the closure mechanism—the glass disc initiating a memory loop that allows Elara to "hear one's own story with new ears"—is told rather than dramatized; we do not witness her recounting with changed perception on the page, only the narrator's assertion that "her voice changed" and "she noticed the small joys." The cost remains implied rather than visible: we see no forfeited option, no trade-off, no on-page consequence beyond the thank-you and hang-up. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (the harmonica's melody, the motif of wrong numbers, the cultivated estrangement), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it restates the premise rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation is functional—archivist, jetty, twilight, locket—but the central causal sequence breaks: Elara performs a ritual (steep locket, write story) and the covenant "takes hold" and "is saved" with no on-page resistance, cost, or change in options. The story declares that the jetty is "saved...from being forgotten" rather than demolition, collapsing the stated external stake (town council vote) into an off-page abstraction. No meaningful turn or tightening occurs; the ritual simply works, and the ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing legible on the page. Under a causal lens the piece lacks because/therefore linkage; under an accumulative lens no density shift or pattern break reweights the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear who/where anchors and moves through Leo's arrival, Elara's proposition, and the station's transformation. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration—the station becomes "a living heart" and Elara's loneliness abates—but the cost remains abstract and asserted ("imperfect and endless") rather than felt in a specific on-page moment. The escalation is a deepening via rumor-chain spread, yet the final image elides the stakes test (what did Elara forfeit to achieve this?) in favor of thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, dowsing for stillpoint) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of absorbed sound, musical notes, and ultrasonic history build toward the threshold where Elara kneels and achieves acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she transforms sorrow into structured composition—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible path is foreclosed on the page, and the "quiet blaze of acceptance" is asserted rather than shown through a decisive forfeiture or altered option. One meaningful deepening occurs (trail of notes → sustained chord in earth), satisfying the lens, but the closure effect lacks the sharp cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (Elara, Outpost, anomaly, console). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered data queries, the anomaly's mirrored response, and the final stabilizing rhythm. Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the anomaly hums, Elara "threshed a profound meaning," connection replaces monster—cost is felt as ongoing uncertainty ("forever listening") rather than a decisive forfeiture. The causal chain is clean (wrong seeds → provoked anomaly → data network → mirrored pattern → synthesis signal → stabilization), and the ending reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through pattern (silence mapped into music) and ends with a resonant reconfiguration (Elian carries the "timeless harmony"). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is legible (the advisor fades, Elian retains the camera and its meaning), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: we're told he feels "joyful sorrow" without on-page forfeiture or a trade-off that alters his options moving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative aspiration but fails to hold coherently. The story opens with adequate anchors (archive, six months off-grid, tapestry fragment), satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the central discovery—portrait-as-map—arrives through convenient analytical leap rather than motivated linkage. The closure unit (mending the tapestry, becoming "keeper of the promise") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice forecloses a legible path or alters his external situation in a felt way.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece attempts a lyric-accumulative design but fails to teach a coherent pattern or anchor causality: Elara perches, drums, the lagoon responds, a vision flares and fades, then she rests—no because/therefore linkage, no narrowing of options, no decision that alters the next beat. The "shared dream" is declared, glimpsed, then summarized as dormant without on-page cost or change in her stance. Orientation is delayed (who she is and where she is are clear, but the stakes and the mechanics of "entangled memories" remain abstract past the first third), and the closure offers repetition ("she would be ready to continue") rather than a decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—Elara demonstrates her philosophy through encounters. Orientation anchors by line ~60 (who/where/storm). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "she had changed one loud world, one soft step at a time" crystallizes her stance with visible demonstration (dockworkers soothed, Kael convinced). Cost is conceptual—her night's labor and risk—but felt rather than decisive. One meaningful deepening (Kael's shift from suspicion to awe) occurs, sufficient for this length under the Situational lens, though the final paragraph tells the thematic payoff rather than showing a decisive forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece presents a Resonant Reconfiguration—the child's fear softens and the darkness "learns to cherish the stars"—but the cost is asserted, not shown: no on-page sentence reveals what Elara or the spirit forfeited. Causality is weak: the spirit's transformation follows directly from Elara's light-weaving without a reversal, complication, or moment when her method fails. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchor by the opening lines), and the accumulative lens is held, but the closure beat lacks the felt price required for credible Charged Poise. The final image ("the patterns remained, a testament to the calm") restates theme without reweighting prior material through a concrete action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation is vague through the opening third: "cobalt library," "perpetual mist," and "hush where past meets prophecy" remain atmospheric labels without clear spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4 per Orientation Test). The story presents a sequence of actions (pacing, retrieving, organizing, watching) linked by "and then" rather than "because/therefore," failing causal escalation. Closure claims success ("forests of second thoughts grew deep") but this outcome is told, not shown with on-page cost or a decisive change. No legible closure unit (DC/RR/CR) lands; the final paragraph summarizes aftermath rather than crystallizing a moment with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara steps onto the island and achieves peace—but the cost remains largely conceptual and asserted ("the world she left behind seemed to fade"). The final image of the scrimshaw dissolving is evocative but the because/therefore linkage from call to island appearance to stepping ashore feels more accumulative than causally tightened. Under a hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural, one meaningful deepening occurs but the escalation is gentle and the felt cost at closure is not sharp on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, Happiness Mandate) arrive early, but the piece offers no meaningful tightening or reversal—Elara begins whittling and narrating, continues whittling and narrating, and ends whittling and narrating with the bouquet still on the table. The turbines' shadows "swallowing the farmhouse" in the penultimate paragraph gestures toward Conceptual Repricing, but no on-page cost or decisive change is legible; the final lines reiterate the opening stasis without reweighting options or meaning. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break charges the closure image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the poet approaches, speaks, crosses threshold, reaches pool, composes verse, and departs in a sequence that deepens atmosphere but lacks a because/therefore linkage or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Closure unit is ambiguous—crossing the threshold, gazing into the pool, or the final departure could each serve, but none reweights prior material with visible cost; the ice thaws as symbol, not consequence of choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first few lines (waive penalty). The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (boundaries dissolve, beauty in change) but the cost remains abstract; I cannot point to an on-page sentence where a foreclosed path or price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens early (barter for awakening) and anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraphs. However, the central turn—Elian's shift from seeking color vision to appreciating form—occurs through passive painting and a convenient magical vibration rather than a choice that narrows options. The concertina reed's awakening feels coincidental (it vibrates in response to his art) rather than earned by protagonist agency. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (he gains "a new way of seeing") with conceptual cost (he does not gain color vision), but the cost is stated rather than viscerally felt on the page, weakening the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through bell-by-bell iterations, and the closure reweights "connection" from isolated analysis to living tapestry. Orientation anchors (Laboratory of Lost Sounds, Elara, post-grid-stabilization) appear early enough. However, the causal chain between "questioning assumptions" and the decision to project outward is thin—Elara's epiphany ("What if the sounds needed a living context") feels asserted rather than dramatized through prior friction. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the laboratory becomes "a living organ"), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story unfolds as a retrospective summary spanning an indeterminate period ("Days passed," "One evening") rather than a continuous scene or two-shard sequence with clear transitions. Orientation anchors who and where early, but the temporal scope remains vague past the 120-word mark and never tightens into a bounded window. Closure reads as a thematic declaration ("grief was not a full stop, but a comma") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost in a final image or action. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is signaled by recurring images (origami, rose stencil, curtains) but the ending delivers exposition about transformation rather than a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when emerge slowly), triggering −0.4. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens but provides no meaningful tightening or deepening; the card readings never narrow options or change knowledge on the page. Closure is asserted in summary ("had woven a new narrative") rather than landing as a visible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The final image—measuring tape lying still, light breaking—gestures at resonance but lacks dramatized cost or a before/after legible through action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Causal (purification ritual) but relies on Accumulative phrasing ("steadily unpredictable," lyric repetition) without teaching a pattern or achieving a decisive tightening. Closure reads as summary ("she had sacrificed her innocence") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The "atoms of nostalgia" purification is told in abstract steps without narrowing options or revealing a visible price at the moment of success. Orientation is present early, waiving that penalty, but the ending lacks a legible closure unit under any single lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure unit—Elara's regret that preserving hope erased authentic pain—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated: no on-page sentence shows what path is now foreclosed or what specific choice she can no longer make. The causal chain (compare footage → identify shadow → channel hope → metamorphose shadow) follows because/therefore linkage, but the final beat substitutes thematic summary for visible consequence, weakening closure legibility under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clear: Elara in her workshop after discovering the theft. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (refined compassion with self-respect intact), and the final image of future readiness carries felt cost—her trust has been tempered. However, the "shedding layers" sequence functions more as extended contemplation than causal escalation; the piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the density increase is modest and the cadence shift at the end is gentle rather than sharp. The closure lands with visible stance crystallization and cost, satisfying the requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: coffee-ring observation → root-guided tunnel → crystal discovery → acceptance. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of his wound as gateway), but the cost remains abstract—"accepting the narrative woven into his flesh" tells rather than showing a path foreclosed. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture; it holds, but the final image ("frosted hourglass...gave a soft click") feels staged rather than earned by prior pressure, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Elara in the projection booth), satisfying the Orientation Test. A single turn occurs when the vision clarifies the letters' location, but this is delivered to Elara rather than caused by her agency. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the role of guardian), yet the cost is conceptual and told ("the search had just begun") rather than felt on the page through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint. Under a Causal lens the linkage is weak; under Accumulative/Textural the pattern does not deepen with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The stated liberation of creativity arrives through assertion ("Her trapped creativity shattered its bonds") without prior causal escalation or a decisive choice that narrows options. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only gradually across multiple paragraphs, though the effect is ultimately legible. The dominant lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with felt cost; the ending restates the opening premise without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "after the last forest burned" timeframe and "divergent archive" remain atmospheric rather than concrete until midpoint. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via spark-tending repetition, final lullaby smoothing), yet the closure—sparks ignite, Elara "no longer empty"—lands as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with visible cost. The chess clock "promise, not a prison" reweights prior material but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation penalty −0.4; closure RR is present but felt cost is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens: accumulative/textural (journey through symbolic forest toward enlightenment). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. The closure unit—placing the gear to unlock consciousness—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("forever changed") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or felt sacrifice. The translocations function as scene-change devices without causal pressure or tactical constraint. One tightening occurs (the jammed machine), but it resolves instantly with no visible price, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vigil structure gathers symbolic weight through the ridgeway traverse, indirect routes, and the star stamp, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara stands at the shore with newfound resolve. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraphs. The closure unit—standing alone at the water with the gleaming star—reweights the "unused courage" premise with felt emotional cost (terror and vastness of untethering), though the conceptual price remains somewhat oblique. One minor causality slip: the guides' task completion and withdrawal feel unmotivated by any on-page test or turn.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a situational lens: Elian discovers a historical tragedy and comes to understand the fortress's willful ignorance. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—he reweights the fortress's safety as a "terrible cost"—but the cost remains abstract and interior. No on-page action, renunciation, or decision alters his situation or forecloses a path; the final lines assert warming resolve without demonstrating what changes or what he loses by holding this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (cycles of seed-planting culminate in activation). Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The closure unit—Theron's "graceful collapse" triggered by the rune—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; Lorian's stance crystallizes without visible price or narrowing of options. The scholar's discovery functions as an off-page convenience that accelerates the confrontation rather than a dramatized pressure point. One meaningful deepening occurs (the rune activates), satisfying baseline escalation, but the turn feels more like a triggered mechanism than a choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: descriptive density around the station, atlas, tapping, and data builds toward a thematic reconfiguration at closure. The "delayed revelation" functions as Conceptual Repricing—nature's cyclical renewal reweights the atlas and prior loss—but the cost remains abstract (years of doubt "cleansed," drifting "moored") rather than a specific forfeiture or tactical change on the page. The closing image gestures toward resonance but does not crystallize a decision or price that alters Kaelen's options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph, meeting the baseline test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and the stone circle's hum—but causality remains weak: Elara's agency does not narrow options or create a meaningful turn; she walks, observes, steps into the circle, and receives visions without a decision that forecloses a path. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted ("spark the dormant hearts") rather than legible on the page—no specific forfeiture, tactical shift, or price paid in the final image. The hum fades and "the quiet of a universe holding its breath" replaces scene pressure with thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a linear causal chain: kite discovery → decoding → cave journey → unsealing → vision → community dialogue. Closure arrives on-page with the vision sequence and subsequent community shift, but the cost remains abstract—Elara gains visions "not as a dictate, but as a catalyst" without visible forfeiture or foreclosed option. The final third summarizes years of thriving rather than landing a decisive image with felt weight. The drive lens reads as causal with light situational elements, held consistently but resolved through summary rather than a charged final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (arboretum, cliff, Elara tending plants). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: somatic cues and botanical motifs layer toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Elara integrates grief rather than erasing it—but the cost is asserted ("released its grip," "no longer a chain") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic. The lens holds, yet the final image lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse library, Elian, tarot cards, present despair). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates memory-threads and intensifies through density until the final paragraph reconfigures Elian's purpose and the tarot box's meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (a redesigned self-concept, moving from failed portraitist to "cartographer of souls") with felt cost visible in the phrase "embraced the necessary darkness." The causal linkage between memory examination and self-redesign is present but somewhat thematic; the piece leans on pattern and cadence shift more than because/therefore pressure, which fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Kael seeks to understand time dilation, performs an experiment, observes the phenomenon, and reaches a conclusion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. However, the closure—Kael's realization and thin smile—lacks felt cost; he "had his answer" and "no longer searching" reads as satisfaction rather than a trade-off or foreclosed path. The experiment's success and the tidy epiphany do not impose visible price, making the Decisive Change more conceptual assertion than on-page reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The piece follows a causal lens: Elara receives letter → decides to act → uploads data → networks respond. However, the closure lacks visible cost—alarms don't sound, the council hasn't reacted on-page, and Elara's "strange peace" and "conscience clear" deflate stakes rather than crystallize a price paid. The ending asserts change ("new chapter began") without dramatizing a decisive alteration or forfeiture that the reader can trace.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The story summarizes Elara's ongoing work across an indeterminate span ("days passed," "one evening") without a single causal turn that narrows options or alters knowledge. The wanderers' arrival could provide pressure, but they are welcomed, rest, receive cuttings, and leave without complication—coincidence decorates rather than tests. The ending asserts legacy and continuity but offers no before/after moment where cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving the Orientation Test penalty). However, closure relies on assertion rather than dramatized cost: "He had succeeded, not by conquering, but by harmonizing" tells the outcome without showing a foreclosed path or felt price. The causal lens is attempted but undercut by passive phrasing ("the echo responded," "constellations stilled") that removes agency from Kael at the pivotal moment. No clear before/after stakes shift lands on the page with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: journalist's call → assumption of innocence → archive investigation → discovery of guilt → decision to publish. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The proof-by-contradiction structure provides clean escalation as each file deepens the contradiction until it collapses. Closure lands on the page with Elara writing the confession, a decisive change with felt cost (ending the family legacy). One weakness: the final beat tells us she "found her own freedom" rather than showing the cost of that freedom through a concrete forfeiture or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never crystallizes into coherent pressure; time-folding and firmware glitches serve as atmospheric decoration without narrowing options. The ending claims resolution ("hushed the dissonance") through summary assertion rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is vague past 120 words (laboratory setting and timeline remain abstract), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Causality is weak: letters explain backstory but do not alter present tactics, and the amber's "frequency" solves a problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mandala accumulates meaning through layered whispers and the emergent hush functions as a cadence shift that reweights communal dread. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "The Unlearning was not an end, but a beginning"), but cost remains abstract—no one pays a visible price, and the final state ("hope," "possibilities") reverses anxiety without on-page friction. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by ~50 words), and the two-shard structure (work → response) fits scope, but the lack of felt sacrifice at the ending caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words and follows a single continuous scene. The closure—Elara renaming herself and feeling the retrocognitive trap loosen—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: the visions "did not vanish, but their hold loosened" without showing what she sacrificed or how her options narrowed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (retrocognitive visions → tessera warmth → name whispered → trap cracks), but the tightening lacks a visible price that forecloses a path on the page. The phrase "aberrant mercy" names the effect without making the conceptual or felt cost legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layering echoes, building harmony). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (theater, hedge maze, orchard, Elara). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—"timelines snap into place," "a gentle acceptance"—but the cost is asserted rather than made palpable; no specific sacrifice or foreclosed option appears on the page. The coin's "work done" and Elara's smile tell us resolution without showing what she gave up or what path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered light-painting as memory map). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Alex completes the visual network and prepares to show Mara, reweighting doubt into "delicate promise of connection"—but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful deepening occurs (the light painting crystallizes his method), yet the final image ("fragile yet radiant") asserts hope without showing what Alex forfeits or risks losing if the bridge fails.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors by line 2 (Kaelen, coastal caves). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: heat-mapping builds toward a mystical event and final reweighting. However, no meaningful tightening or reversal narrows options; the fossil floats, Kaelen floats, the goal is achieved without friction. The closure image ("the world...had found its voice") is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or visible cost. The before/after is declared but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost. The prophecy shifts from red to gold, but no on-page choice, renunciation, or crystallized stance forecloses a path with visible consequence—the change simply happens as a result of cataloging. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, with "amber warehouse beneath cliffs" offering little spatial anchor and "hourglass turner" reading as a role rather than a grounded individual. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught or held to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spy context). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias decodes snow patterns → reaches Anya → broadcasts evidence → pays the price. Closure lands on the page with Elias wounded but smiling, mission accomplished, which qualifies as Decisive Change with visible cost. However, the escalation is linear rather than deepening through reversals; enemy agents arrive conveniently late, and the transmission completes without meaningful friction or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across multiple paragraphs without urgency. The closure—forgiveness starting with himself—is told rather than enacted; no on-page action or renunciation demonstrates cost. The drive lens reads accumulative-reflective, yet the final moment asserts resolution without reweighting prior material through image or choice. Causality is present but thin; the ticking gutters function as a timer without forcing tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: sun patterns, chimney smoke, thrum, and ghostly beekeepers layer toward a final image of kindness as anchor. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—Kael holding the glass aloft and the oasis feeling "whole"—lacks visible cost; the thrum "subsides into a peaceful silence" without foreclosing a path or imposing a felt price. The final paragraph's summary ("Because kindness, like light, could anchor a soul...") tells rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual performed, bud discovered. Orientation anchors by ~120 words. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bud's promise, but no felt cost or option-foreclosure lands on the page—the cycle simply continues as stated. The "invitation to begin again" is asserted rather than dramatized with pressure, and the final image recycles the mirror motif without reweighting prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (Elara, Tidal Library, post-reincarnation), satisfying the Orientation Test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum intensifies, projections appear, and the final image reweights her stance from isolation to guardian. However, the closure unit—"she found independence in the duty to preserve and learn"—is told rather than enacted; no on-page choice forecloses a live option with dramatized cost. The hum "steadies her" and visions "settle without breaking her," but these are asserted states, not micro-decisions that narrow tactics or alter relationships. A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation is prompt: who, where, when anchored early. The closure gesture (kneeling, hand on nest, understanding "the thread") is on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and not concretely legible—what exactly has Elara forfeited or altered? The dominant stake ("find the thread that connects all things") is philosophical and never tested against a competing want or fear. Under an Accumulative lens, the spiral-building and visitor contributions accumulate texture, but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt price; under Causal, the because/therefore chain is weak (storm → twig → labyrinth → epiphany lacks motivated pressure). The piece hovers between lenses without teaching a pattern or paying off disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently within opening lines and delivers an on-page Decisive Change: Aris activates the counter-signal, the trickster broadcast dissolves, and he accepts his role as guardian with visible career and social risk. The causal lens holds through the broadcast sequence (bypass protocols → subsonic burst → signal stutters → crowds quiet), but Evans's appearance and her rapid shift from fury to respect feel unmotivated—her "grudging, calculating respect" arrives without prior setup of her values or a dramatized reassessment. Cost is legible (he defied orders, risked scandal) but the resolution's ease (crowds quiet, Evans relents) undercuts the stakes declared earlier. One meaningful tightening occurs, sufficient for this length, but the convenience of the double payoff (signal gone *and* emotions soothed) softens the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers plot summary in sequential blocks rather than motivated causality: Elara arrives, hears music, charts it, meets a keeper who explains everything, then departs. The "vital key" turns out to be a harmonic pattern handed to her by exposition; no on-page choice narrows options or pays a visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early enough, but the nexus's spatial geometry is told, not shown through navigational friction. The ending asserts change without a decisive on-page act or resonant image that reweights prior material, failing the closure-cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure (the ribbon's meaning shifts from identity-clue to relationship-token). The escalation from concrete detail (ribbon) to abstract impression (life lost) to final realization is legible, and the cost is conceptual: the truth remains unprovable but narratively reweighted. However, the closure unit is told rather than shown—"she understood the tragedy was not a malicious act"—which weakens the felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern (detail → space → synthesis) early and holds it, but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, preventing higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late—weather station location, time period, and Elara's physical situation remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "reversible exile" mechanism is explained via summary rather than dramatized discovery; the copper nail retrieval happens off-page through a remote probe, denying the protagonist agency at the climax. Closure arrives as committee announcement via video link—a told resolution without visible cost or a final image that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but linkage breaks when convenience (Roy's sudden helpfulness, perfectly timed sonar data) resolves obstacles the protagonist did not create.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the fiddler's shift from confusion to illumination, but the closure is told rather than felt—"Elias felt the boundaries of reality soften" asserts the change without a concrete on-page action or image that makes cost legible. Orientation arrives reasonably (name, pullout, glass flake by ~80 words), but the hitchhiker's vanishing remains ungrounded summary, and the "bridge" she crossed is metaphor without physical or social consequence. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through most of its length, yet the final beats declare transformation without demonstrating tightening or deepening that forecloses a path. No clear cost is visible in the ending sentence or image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid with Accumulative elements: Leo follows territorial markers → finds squatter → dissuades him → spreads currency → realizes cycle. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he leaves the train, breaking the cycle), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically felt—no concrete forfeit or lived tension charges the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first third. The squatter encounter provides one meaningful tightening, but the final paragraph's thematic summary flattens the closure beat instead of letting the image land.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who and where are anchored early; when remains vague (multiple nights collapse into "tonight" and "that night" without clear progression). The piece presents as accumulative/textural but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift—beats loop through similar discovery-and-transcription moves without narrowing options. The closure unit ("dawn of this new understanding") asserts resonance but offers no visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page; the Cost Proof Test fails because no sentence shows what Elara forfeits or forecloses. Orientation penalty (−0.4) and cost-legibility failure combine to prevent mid-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is vague past the 120-word mark: "heart of the cursed lake" anchors location but "after the magic trick failed" provides no concrete temporal or causal grounding (−0.4 for orientation debt per Q2 test). The closure unit—vortex calms, confession revealed—lacks visible cost: Elara stands in "peace" with a declared emotional shift but no forfeited path or tactical constraint on the page. The drive lens wavers between attempted Causal ("to unbend… she would need to merge") and Accumulative mood-painting without teaching a coherent pattern by midpoint. The seed's mechanics are announced late and resolve a problem (frozen confession) it did not help create, breaking earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and motifs (roots, scars, clipping, portal) layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page—Elara's roots transform into "bridges of light" and the covenant stirs—but the cost feels asserted ("weight lift," "stood free") rather than viscerally earned through prior causal linkage. The portal's arrival and crossing occur without meaningful on-page resistance or tactical adjustment, reducing the felt price of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Elara, present-tense journey) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara inlays meaning across the orchard, and the keeper's intervention deepens her understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance over control) with felt emotional cost. However, the causal link between laying the card on the rib and the roots "seeming to stir" is weak—coincidence complicates but does not resolve, yet the keeper's arrival feels convenient rather than earned. The closure shifts her stance from trammel-as-control to trammel-as-surrender, but the transition bypasses on-page friction; the cost is more asserted ("quiet healing") than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical change forced by prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear (quarry office trailer, post-failure). The drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid: Leo's failure → isolation → Mara's visit → insight → new direction. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (abandoning insulation, embracing hybrid identity), but the turn from deflection to purpose arrives in a single conversation without intermediate friction or a visible price paid on the page. The framed grille cloth ending gestures toward Charged Poise but the cost remains asserted ("he found peace") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clean by opening lines (who, where, when). The piece follows a single continuous scene in the magnetic arbor, maintaining POV stability. However, closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elian realizes the physics of transition through resonance and alignment—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "never be haunted again" and "his work complete" tell us the stakes have resolved without showing what path was foreclosed or what tangible price was paid. The drive lens appears Causal (cuneiform analogies lead to magnetic resonance insight lead to lattice restoration) but the because/therefore chain at closure substitutes explanation for pressure: visions flicker, he "realized," he "whispered," the arbor "seemed to sigh." No motivated ellipsis or narrowed options make a legible before/after with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but no on-page closure effect emerges. Elian begins smelting identities and ends smelting identities with no decision, renunciation, or reweighted cost visible in the final image. The narrative is a static ritual loop: he performs the same action on multiple vessels without escalation, reversal, or a moment that forecloses a path. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, yet the final image ("the cycle awaited its next turn, forever preserved") resets to the opening premise without reweighting stakes or imposing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors coalesce slowly across the opening third, and "the crystal caves" remains a generic placeholder without spatial grounding until the stalagmite appears. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit—Kaelen's resolve to redesign bunkers—is told as future intent rather than landing on the page with visible cost; the pearl's light and his internal shift occur, but the cost (what path is foreclosed, what he loses by this choice) remains abstract. The reversal from inspector-as-technician to inspector-as-hope-keeper is stated rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that narrows options. Causality is loose: the seashell "compelled" him without prior setup, and the pearl's radiance erupts without resistance or price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates images (ivy, accordion, graffiti, map) toward a final reconfiguration where Elara plays and finds peace. Orientation anchors appear by the second paragraph (station, accordion, her goal). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance/integration), but the cost feels asserted in summary ("fragile but real," "healed heart") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The graffiti line does reweight her self-blame, yet the turn from guilt to solace lacks visible friction or a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as situational-accumulative hybrid, but the closure fails to land with visible cost: Elara reaches the threshold, the watch beeps a reversal, yet she simply trusts her notes and enters without forfeiting anything on the page. The "second fateful letter would confirm her success" defers closure off-page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive reasonably early, but the final beat lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The text teaches a pattern (cipher, reversal, delay) but does not pay it off with an on-page reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when), and a closure unit exists: Elara plays the violin, seeds burst forth, propagation begins. However, the cost remains abstract—"what was lost and gained" is told rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or consequence. The causal chain from coffee-stain divination to violin-playing feels convenient; the violin's propagation power is introduced and resolved in quick succession without prior constraint or tactical adjustment. The lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid, but the decisive change lacks a legible price beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is vague: the skyborne grotto and star-singer are introduced without clear spatial or temporal grounding by 120 words, though the fantasy register teaches some tolerance. The dominant stake—capturing the spark—is declared but never faces meaningful opposition or reversal; Elara simply performs the ritual and succeeds. No causal linkage tightens options: the infusion proceeds in a straight line from intent to completion. Closure lacks decisive change or visible cost; the chip glows, she boxes it, and reflects on past successes without foreclosing any path or paying a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Who/where/when anchors arrive early (committed caretaker, umbral grotto, after forgiving), satisfying orientation. The piece attempts an accumulative/textural lens through recurring images (hairpin, scalloping, climbing), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each beat restates the quest for contentment without narrowing options or altering tactics. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing ("contentment sprang from active participation in rebirth"), yet the cost is never made legible on the page; the final image wraps Elara in "peace" and "fulfillment" without visible forfeiture or trade-off. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear spatial anchors (lighthouse, dawn, breeze) and establishes a consultative encounter. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: wind chimes, mirror shard, and cloak recur to build density around the theme of doubt versus certainty. However, closure relies heavily on summary ("welcomed nuance into certainty," "her heart lighter") rather than a final image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The cost—Elara's rigid plans "softening into adaptable intentions"—is declared but not shown through a specific forfeiture or action that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation delayed: who, where, when remain vague past the 120-word threshold; the floating platform and "world below" are spatial abstractions. Drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation competes with a causal lesson structure, yet no clear pressure tightens or deepens until the final paragraph's summary revelation. Closure is asserted ("the lesson was complete") rather than enacted; no on-page decisive change or felt cost forecloses a path. The trance functions as a convenience device to deliver exposition rather than a causally earned event.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the piece gestures toward causal linkage (arrowhead as conduit) yet resolves through summary assertion ("the pulse was no longer wandering") without on-page demonstration of changed options or felt cost. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final image ("Elara had become one with the history it cherished") is told rather than shown, and no concrete choice or renunciation on the page makes a before/after legible. The story teaches a pattern of lyric accumulation but fails to deliver a decisive tightening or cost that the reader can point to in the ending lines.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal frame but lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elian decides to use the keystone, succeeds without complication, and the spire transforms—no resistance or price shapes the peak moment. The orientation is reasonably clear by the opening, but the closure effect (the spire becoming a sanctuary) happens to Elian rather than through a choice with legible cost. The ending summarizes legacy across time rather than landing a single decisive image where cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is anchored (lamplighter, pier, festival night) but the causal chain weakens after the key discovery: Elias inserts the key, finds the orb, witnesses color-sound synesthesia, then rows back with no complication or choice. The closure reads as Decisive Change (he perceives differently), yet the cost is invisible—no trade-off, no path foreclosed on the page. The "luminous vows" brighten in acknowledgment but do not constrain or reweight his options. Drive lens appears Causal but ellipsis replaces motivated linkage at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. However, the piece strings seventeen short summary beats in "and then" fashion without a single causal turn that narrows options or raises cost. The ending asserts that Elara "found her alignment," but no on-page event forces a choice or forecloses a path; she simply continues her work as before. The "backwards prophecy" realization ("the contraction was transformation") lands as exposition rather than a decision with visible consequence, failing the closure-with-cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reaper's nature and purpose remain hazy through the first 150+ words, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens in principle, but no meaningful deepening or cadence shift occurs—the reaper adjusts apparatus, watches crystallization, and walks away with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The closure reads as Charged Poise in intent, but the final image ("the atlas page in his hand felt like a map not of monsters, but of memories") is asserted rather than earned by prior pressure. No felt cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (dawn progression, dripping rates). Orientation anchors early (sapphire viaduct, Elian, broken bell). The closure unit—bell rings, river revives—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "fatigue set in" and "brittle devotion wavered" do not foreclose options or alter his approach. The story teaches a method (dripping rates) but deploys it in a single, uncontested application with no meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows choices before success.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (trail of photographs → memory → community gathering → memorial decision) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, the escalation is thin: Elias follows a trail, remembers, then speaks to villagers who immediately agree without friction or reversal. The closure unit—a memorial garden and restored wind chime—registers as Decisive Change but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page; no sentence identifies what Elias or the community has forfeited or risked to achieve this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density increases toward a lyric closure. Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara crystallizes her readiness—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("no longer feared") rather than felt on the page. The crystal's "transformation" and flower-blooming beat do not narrow options or create visible loss; the piece accumulates texture but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (isolated post, nocturnal arbor above clouds, post-static moment) arrive early enough. The inferred lens is Causal: incoming anomalous data → protocol revision → hybrid analysis → celestial-event discovery. However, the stakes remain abstract—"preserve trust" is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma where trust could actually be lost. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (chaos to coherent pattern, terror to hope), but the cost is conceptual only ("the burden now a mantle she wore with pride") without a visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off that narrows her future options. One tightening occurs (frayed cables, incoming anomalies force protocol overhaul), meeting the 600–800 word sufficiency bar, but the ending reweights her emotional stance more than her material situation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is established (floating dojo, Kael meditates, dawn custody battle), satisfying the early anchor test. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (merging essences to vivify consciousness), but the mechanism—"using the dojo's ancient rituals"—arrives unearned and unexplained, functioning as a convenient solve rather than a causal extension of prior moves. History's rewriting ceases abruptly without demonstrated cost or tactical constraint traced to Kael's agency. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the key turn (the merge proposal) lacks because/therefore linkage to prior on-page choices; Kael simply announces a solution mid-debate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density and pattern break intended to reweight the stake). The orientation anchor is delayed; by ~120 words we have "echo chamber tunnel" and a figure, but "household" remains abstract and off-page throughout, creating spatial ambiguity that is never resolved. Closure gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration (the laughter returns "tinged with the wisdom of loss"), but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page—no on-page choice, forfeiture, or image makes the price undeniable. The lens holds loosely, but closure lacks visible proof of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates symbolic weight through recurring phrases and the pendant's hum. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the guardian becomes one with uncertainty—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific on-page moment. The pendant shatters and boundaries dissolve, yet no prior tactic or choice is visibly foreclosed; the transformation feels declared rather than causally prepared by specific pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with motivational clarity (alchemist seeks to vivify crozier, defy prophecy). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (crozier vivified, destiny interrupted), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: "proving the prophecy wrong" tells success without on-page trade-off or foreclosed path. The crozier's destruction and reformation follow stated intention without a complicating reversal or tactical shift that narrows options. Because/therefore linkage is present but the stakes never tighten beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is functional by ~120 words. The closure unit—discarding assumptions to hear silence—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not dramatized as a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The piece teaches a lens (accumulative/textural via density and cadence shift), but pressure does not meaningfully tighten; Elara's insight arrives without prior failed attempts or a reversal that narrows options. The ending reconfigures her perception, but no on-page choice or renunciation makes a before/after legible with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation remains vague past the 120-word mark: "spectral grotto" under "cold, piercing starlight" never anchors physical space or time sufficiently for comprehension, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Decisive Change (ferry materializes), but the mechanics—holding the hourglass and turning it—lack visible cost or felt trade-off; the grotto simply "fades" and the ship reappears whole. Linkage reads as outline sequencing ("certain sequences," "interconnected patterns," "align the patterns perfectly") without dramatized because/therefore steps that narrow options. The inferred lens (Causal with Accumulative overlay) wobbles at closure when the final image delivers wish-fulfillment without on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece offers orientation (who/where) within the opening but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—hovering between Accumulative (pattern-building through weaving) and Causal (the eruption as consequence) without committing. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she was the connection, the architect of her own fever dreams") but the cost is conceptual rather than felt or visible on the page; we see no path foreclosed, no tactical constraint imposed by this realization. The "unsettling calm" that bookends the story feels static rather than transformed, failing the before/after test.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (benthic city, post-contact setting, instructor role). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lesson deepens from edge geometry → xenocartography → Kael's engagement → Elara's solitary reflection, with the chain link recurring as thematic anchor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ocean reweighted from "prison" to "launchpad"), but the cost remains felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The shift is conceptual and poetic, satisfying the RR test, but the price lacks concrete legibility on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the atrium's function, Elara's location before arrival, and the nature of her "contact tracer for hearts" role remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece accumulates atmospheric description but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Elara locates Eleanor, Eleanor tells her story, Eleanor departs—no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. The "closure" is a soft reassurance ("You will be remembered") without visible sacrifice, decisional turn, or conceptual repricing. Under a Causal lens, the linkage is weak; under Accumulative, no pattern breaks or cadence shifts at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story strings together exploration beats without because/therefore linkage: Elara moves deeper, finds cables, places the codex, sees ghosts, leaves. The tidal-change deadline is declared urgent but never tightens a choice or forces a trade-off; she simply "emerges just as the currents reversed." The codex hologram reveals safe paths, yet phase transitions remain abstract; no on-page moment shows her selecting one route over another with visible cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "healing" and "tribute" are told rather than made legible through a decisive image or forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Elara, opal observatory, post-catastrophe). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered memory fragments in ink until the final cadence shift delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she stops counting, integrates the shard as lesson, accepts the loss). Cost is legible: she releases obsessive proof-of-life rituals and acknowledges her reckless leadership. One meaningful deepening occurs when ink patterns coalesce into distinct choices rather than tragedy-blur, reweighting her stance from haunted to whole. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal drive: Elara waits, decodes the birds, enters the tunnel, confronts the diamond, and shifts from opposition to harmony. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure—harmonizing with the curse rather than fighting it—lands on the page with a visible tactical shift, though the cost of this pivot (what she forfeits by mimicking rather than translating) remains somewhat abstract. The dying language thread, introduced early, does not constrain her final choice in a legible way, creating mild thematic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—garden imagery, static confessions, and gravitational play accumulate toward metamorphosis—but the closure lacks visible cost: plants glow, bodies soften into light and shadow, Elara's eyes brighten, yet no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The arrowhead "transforms" and the garden "thrives," but these are declared effects, not felt consequences. Orientation anchors within 120 words, but the final third collapses into summary assertion ("their forms fluid," "transformation it had sparked would endure") without a decisive image or renunciation that makes before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; who/where/when remain vague until "central clearing." The closure—crystal dies, orchard renews—occurs as external spectacle without on-page cost to Elara; she plays, things happen, she smiles. Causality is assertion-driven: "the method of signaling through heart rhythms" appears as label without prior setup or mechanical grounding. The inferred lens (Causal) collapses when the Warden's transformation and crystal's death are triggered by music with no visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The story presents a single scene with one decision: Elian places the thunderstorm bottle in the drone. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the drone arrives on schedule, he loads it, it departs successfully. The closure is a mood statement ("glimmer of progress") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. Under a Causal lens, no because/therefore linkage narrows options; under Accumulative, no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~100 words. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration—the singing and glowing fragment crystallize a new state—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: what path has Elias foreclosed, what stamina spent, what vulnerability risked? The halo fragment's intensifying gleam and the horses' "straightening" read as convenient magic rather than pressure earned through prior constraint. One meaningful deepening occurs (work → song), satisfying length expectations, but the final image leans on whispering metaphor instead of a legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first quarter and follows a causal sequence: scarf → hyperbolic geometry → doorway → realm. The closure is a Decisive Change (Elara crosses into the story-realm), but the cost is asserted ("had become a part of them forever") rather than legibly paid—she loses the scarf yet gains everything she sought without visible trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, and the escalation tightens once (geometry activates scarf, wall ripples), meeting the single-tightening allowance for this length, but the final image lacks the friction that would make the transformation undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers imagery and poetic density toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—capturing the mother's image and finding peace—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (resolution of yearning), but the cost remains abstract ("the dream was finally at rest, and so was she") rather than a legible forfeiture or consequence that alters tactics. One meaningful deepening is present (the dream resolves into the mother's figure), satisfying length expectations, but the felt price is more asserted than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is withheld past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—"idea freed, now spreading its wings"—lands as summary assertion rather than on-page decisive change or felt cost; the lock of hair becomes "inert" off-stage, and Elian's internal state is unchanged. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure. The "wave of disorientation" and archway beat offer potential escalation, yet the resolution ("whispered words of release") bypasses dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the broken-constellation pattern accumulates and the final alignment delivers a charged reconfiguration. Closure is on the page—memories return, water recedes, the greenhouse "felt less heavy"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific forfeiture with stakes. The orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the central stake (recovering memories) is legible, but the resolution feels ambient: balance is "restored" without a visible price that alters Elara's later options.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of annotations and shadows builds toward understanding). Orientation anchors are present early (forgotten library, archivist, Elian by table). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian sees the connection between tea leaves and shadow, shifting his stance from frustration to readiness. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elian leaves "ready," the archivist walks forward with calm nerves, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image. The ending reconfigures the archivist's nervousness (she now walks forward), but the weight of what she or Elian sacrificed remains implied rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural mode but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost at closure. Elara performs a familiar ritual, the orchard is restored exactly as hoped, and she returns to tending trees with no option foreclosed or meaning reweighted. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear anchors, but the ending offers only satisfaction and stasis—no visible price paid, no path closed, no crystallized tension. Under the accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material; instead it decorates hope without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (silence accumulates, then disperses), but the closure lacks visible cost—spirits are "at peace," weight lifts, satisfaction replaces unrest without any foreclosed path or trade-off on the page. The net-unraveling proceeds linearly without reversal or meaningful tightening; each knot releases a spirit in identical fashion. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalty, but the ending offers relief without reweighting prior material or imposing felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers details (map tear, video comparison, fissure) toward a final discovery. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (ancient henge, map framer), within tolerance. However, the closure unit—finding the whole map in the chapel—lacks visible cost; Elara "felt the divide soften" and "empathy forever deepened" are asserted emotions without a forfeited path or felt price. The narrative arc functions, but the ending reconfiguration is conceptual claim rather than on-page image that reweights prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clear early; the Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of image and motif builds toward thematic repricing). Closure registers as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights "letting go" from loss to integration via the snow globe's cycle. However, cost remains abstract and told ("lightness," "trust in the universal current") rather than a visible forfeiture or enacted choice that forecloses a path on the page. The −0.4 Cost Proof deduction applies: no single sentence shows what Elara loses or refuses in order to "release."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece presents one continuous scene with clear anchors (misty courtyard, storm timing). However, closure lacks felt cost: Elara completes her mural and the ghost acknowledges her, but no path is foreclosed and no visible price is paid on the page—she descends "carrying the warmth" with no complication. The causal lens is established but the ending delivers satisfaction without the struggle or sacrifice required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The "driftingly alert moment" and storm timing create atmosphere but do not tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: diary entries layer meaning floor by floor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara "found the joy she sought" at the summit. Cost is asserted but not dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift results from the discovery. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The elevator climb provides a clear frame, but causality is thin; each floor simply reveals more text without meaningful reversal or deepening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the piece loops its central claim—empty spaces remember—without a meaningful tightening, deepening, or cadence shift. The string-break inciting incident occurs before the narrative window opens, leaving no on-page reversal or pressure point. The ending restates the premise ("he had proven empty spaces remember") as summary rather than delivering a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is stable (gondola, post-break, solo), so no penalty there, but closure remains asserted, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal chain: search → puzzle → creation → realization, with the closure crystallizing around the conceptual cost that replication strips infinity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the craft sequence and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. Orientation is swift (tree library, artist, impending demolition by line 2). One modest turn—unlocking the safe—tightens options, and the conceptual repricing at closure (mimicry cannot capture boundlessness) lands with felt constraint, though the cost could be more viscerally anchored in a specific forfeited action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the opening. The drive lens reads Causal: Elara decodes symbols → finds coordinates → captain changes course. Closure is a Decisive Change (new air current charted, ship enters it), but the cost is implied rather than felt—no visible trade-off, renunciation, or foreclosed path on the page. The final paragraphs confirm success and "sociable isolation" as theme rather than dramatizing a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening, waiving the test penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure: the hall of mirrors reweights "repair" from force to alignment with natural cycles. However, the closure cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no visible price is paid on the page that alters Elara's options. The causal chain from prophecy → gear assortment → hall → uncapping is present but feels mechanical, with each step unlocking the next without meaningful resistance or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard planet, survivors) arrive early. The lens reads Causal initially but shifts to Accumulative/Textural at closure when the nebula unveils and "the garden grows" becomes the resonant image. The transition is taught, but the closure unit—environmental restoration triggered by collective effort—lacks on-page felt cost; the brambled hope simply blooms without a visible price paid by any character. The pieces connect (bell → arches → nebula) but the final image asserts transformation rather than showing what was foreclosed or sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with clear causal steps: climb → place puppet → adjust → whisper → completion. However, the closure effect—Elara smiling as the lighthouse fades—lacks a legible cost that forecloses a path; the "task done" reads as fulfillment without visible price, trending toward summary rather than a felt change. Under a Causal lens, the ending delivers completion but not decisive alteration with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as causal with some accumulative texture. Orientation anchors arrive by ~60 words (Elara, orchard, labyrinth). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from reluctance to acceptance), but the cost is largely told—"feeling less like chains"—rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice on the page. The rescue sequence follows motivated steps (blueprint → assembly → projection → safe exit), but the final "quiet acceptance" lacks the sharp, legible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: ravine descent → chrysalis → foam insight → lab return builds density toward closure. Orientation anchors clearly (chemist, ravine, post-accident timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (grief loosened into acceptance, new polymer project honors Elena), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint. The foam insight crystallizes motivation, yet the lab presentation and team collaboration are summarized in the final third, flattening what should be the peak tightening. Causality holds but the ending tells transformation rather than showing a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: by line 120 we know "Elara" and "glass orchard library," but her store's actual function, the nature of "clean slate vendor," and the physical layout remain vague abstractions. The closure—Elara welcoming a seeker after discovering "the place where stories begin"—lacks visible cost; she simply opens a doorway and writes, with no foreclosed path or felt price. Causality is weak: the moonlight circle "responds" without resistance, the doorway forms because she traces air, and patrons arrive on cue once she's decided to help them. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern is taught early enough to guide comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the first paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure unit is unclear: Kaelen's "work complete" at the end is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The middle contains multiple paraphrase loops ("subsume the remorse" repeated across beats) that obscure whether any options narrow or knowledge changes. The drive lens appears intended as Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt cost—only summary statements that the pavilion "sighed" and memories became "softer, more manageable."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what the villages' actual conflict entails remains abstract past the opening third. The closure—clock chimes, villages reunited—occurs as a declared result rather than a dramatized change with visible cost. Drive lens reads as causal but key links (invitation → representatives appear; weight reattached → unity restored) are summarized, not shown. The "grain elevator talk" unfolds as cooperative description, not a reversal or tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a single static tableaux—Elara with mirror in canyon—without causal linkage or meaningful tightening. Orientation is delayed and vague (who is she beyond labels? why this night? what concrete cost faces her?). The "transformation" is told through metaphysical summary rather than dramatized beats that narrow options. No closure unit lands with felt cost; the final paragraph asserts completion ("transformation complete") without showing a before/after change in tangible stakes or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors land clearly, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between accumulative texture and causal problem-solving without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the guardian), but the cost is told rather than shown on the page; no concrete sentence demonstrates what she forfeited or what specific option closed. The "reenter" beat is set up early but the threshold crossing lacks a decisive consequence that narrows tactics. Per Orientation Test, cap applied where relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a density-building progression—silence → discovery → interpretation → music—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove reawakens) with felt cost (Elara's seasons of waiting, her careful translation of the cracks). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (grove, Elara, her practice) within the first quarter. The closure lands on the page as the trees respond and "the silent world was silent no more," reweighting the premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the porcelain's stress cracks become the key, narrowing her method and enabling the final turn. Minor causality softness: the hedgehog's uncurling as symbolic opening feels asserted rather than causally linked to Elara's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is and what he seeks emerge gradually through backstory rather than early anchors (−0.3). The closure unit—pressing the stone to the lodestone—produces a vision and a stirring of the covenant, but the cost is conceptual and off-page (the covenant "breathing again" is metaphorical). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered memory and setting detail building to a charged image), but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure; instead it offers hopeful promise without a felt price. No meaningful tightening occurs; the nexus energy and stone alignment unfold without escalation or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a single action—unlocking the diary—that succeeds without complication or reversal. No meaningful tightening occurs; the clasp clicks open and Elara reads entries in a linear sequence. The ending offers thematic summary ("the silence of fulfillment") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. Orientation is adequate but the causal lens collapses into accumulative description without a closure unit that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through sensory observation, journaling ritual, and the seed's gradual emergence to a final Resonant Reconfiguration (serenity achieved, seed sprouting). Orientation anchors (Aethelgard, herbalist, corpse flower seed) land by ~15% and remain stable. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—the seed cracks and Elara smiles without forfeiting a path or facing a trade-off on the page; the "cost" is retrospective patience, not a present sacrifice that alters options at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative coloring (water flow, arrow tip, echoes converge), but the closure effect is weak: Kaelen gains knowledge and departs with no dramatized cost or foreclosed option—he will "share this discovery" in a future scene. The arrow-tip visions deliver backstory that resolves the mystery off-stage, undercutting on-page agency. One tightening occurs when gravity inverts, but the reversal does not narrow options or impose a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (investigator, container labyrinth, post-disaster survey) land by ~15% and the single-POV continuous scene holds. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through wind data, wreckage observation, and the patch discovery toward a final image of prevention brewing. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the patch becomes "a heavy token," the silence "full of unspoken warnings"—but the cost remains abstract ("vigilance required") rather than a specific foreclosed path or tactical sacrifice on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (patch discovery reweights the survey from data to human toll), satisfying the length's requirement, but the final image asserts thematic harvest without demonstrating what Elias has relinquished or altered in his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural intended, but the piece never teaches its pattern or imposes cost. The "unfettering" happens because the aurora appears and the bells are rung—coincidence resolves rather than complicates. The parallel sculptor's chisel is pure simultaneity without causal linkage or impact on Elara's options. Closure is a declared success ("wonder was no longer a hidden treasure") with no visible forfeiture or reweighted stake; RR/CR requires undeniable cost, which is absent here.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (weaving between worlds accumulates perspectives until a cadence shift at return). Orientation anchors are present early (thunder-echo range, post-citadel fall). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he returns with insights, no longer viewing silence as oppressive). However, cost is asserted rather than shown—"the flute felt lighter," "his heart lighter"—without a concrete on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint that makes the before/after legible with felt price. The piece teaches its pattern (arranging markers, stepping through portals, witnessing failures, returning), but the final reweighting lacks undeniable pressure or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens—density and pattern rather than because/therefore causality—but the closure unit is weak: "She had not found the mathematics of emotion, but she had learned its language" is an abstract claim, not a charged image or action. The final cost ("the cost of her quest," "the mathematics were not in the feeling, but in the space between feelings") is told in summary rather than shown through a decisive choice or forfeiture that forecloses a path. The halo-fragment transfer moment ("she felt her own essence flow into the fragment") offers a potential Resonant Reconfiguration, but it dissolves into philosophical summary instead of landing as a discrete, felt change with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present (Kaelen, ridgeway, night delivery) but the closure unit is weak: the story ends with a declaration of intention rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. The encounter with the traveler extends via the pendant's magic but produces only an internal epiphany ("the germinated idea take root") that is told, not dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The lens reads as accumulative/textural (aurora imagery, pendant hum, memory-to-myth motif), but the final paragraph summarizes transformation across time rather than landing a charged moment with felt pressure. Cost is conceptual and deferred, not legible in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the end of the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara confronting her own guilt via the frost patterns—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: "her world tilted on its axis" and "weight heavier now with understanding" are asserted rather than made visceral through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density increase via layered visions), held consistently, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. Orientation is present early (orchard, bamboo forest, loom), and the closure—Elara's dissolution into the message and the orchard's renewal—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (sacrifice that reweights the world's state). However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we're told she becomes "part of the unraveling" but the moment lacks visceral pressure. The narrative advances through accretion of images (puzzle edges, amber bead, raveling silence) rather than because/therefore linkage, which is acceptable under Accumulative logic, but the final beat does not decisively narrow options or demonstrate a visible tradeoff—it simply occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but never coheres: the piece cycles through descriptive beats (forge work, mine descent, mage encounter, spreading his methods) without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Closure is asserted ("bartered awakenings can transform rubble into strength") rather than landed through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is present early, but the mage encounter and the alloy forging are summarized in adjacent paragraphs without causal linkage or felt consequence. The final paragraphs loop the opening premise without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with reasonably clear anchors (who, where, rough stakes) and follows a causal thread: shard contact → rift opening → truth revealed. However, the core closure—learning his mother erased herself—lands as exposition ("he saw his mother... making the choice") rather than a dramatized change that alters Kaelen's options on the page. The ending tells us "the truth now a part of him, woven into the very map of his being" but does not show a before/after in stance or available action. Cost is asserted ("heavier than any metal, yet lighter than a breath") but remains metaphorical rather than legible in a concrete choice or forfeiture at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elian, predawn fog, Claw Island lighthouse) arrive promptly. The closure—relighting the lamp and leaving a note—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the beam's defiant glow holds the haunting at bay with visible cost in his labor and confrontation). Causality is clean through the letter discovery, cairn building, and lamp relighting sequence. Cost is legible in the physical work and the "luminescent ache" that remains part of the light's beauty, though the haunting's retreat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure: the piece loops through atmospheric description without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes before/after visible with cost. Kael begins at the lighthouse, performs his routine, and ends having performed it; nothing forecloses a path or reweights options. The "accidentally prophetic visions" arrive without altering his stance or tactics. Orientation is present (who/where/when by ~120 words), but causality is non-existent—each paragraph restates the same thematic claim in synonym loops rather than advancing pressure. Drive lens ambiguity persists: is this causal, accumulative, or situational? The ending cannot answer.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure with felt cost. Kaelen sits, aligns a wing to catch sunlight, watches symbols appear on a wall, and concludes he now understands story-magnetism—but no option is foreclosed, no path rejected, no price paid on the page. The "illumination" is told entirely in passive observation ("he saw," "he realized") without agency or reversal. The blue morpho wing crumbles, but this is cosmetic rather than consequential, and the final image ("filled with a valley-mist wonder") is mood assertion, not reconfiguration. Under any lens, the ending summarizes insight without dramatizing change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (dream-maps, moonlight, sextant align toward a lyric resolution), but causality remains vague: the pin's clink "marks a shift in the tower's ancient energy" without prior setup or consequence, and the sextant's glow responds to dreams through unexplained magic. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph, waiving the test. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (sorrow deconstructed, protagonist lighter), yet cost is asserted rather than shown—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid on the page. The trees' "whispered memories" supply visions that replace sadness with "mundane miracles," but this exchange feels narrated rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, satisfying the test. However, the closure offers a Decisive Change (realm restored, communities reunited) that feels unearned—no on-page reversal narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The "profound stillness" and "single thread of dawn light" momentarily tighten pressure, but the resolution follows a straight because/therefore line without complication or cost. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the protagonist's success appears automatic once she begins singing, undermining closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is beyond "compassionate recluse" and where her cottage sits remain vague past the first third. The piece follows a causal thread (invitation → library → ritual → insight), but the closure—"enlarged tranquility" and renewed purpose—lands as asserted emotional summary rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The mistake backstory and elder's guidance function as exposition that tells the arc rather than dramatizing a reversal. Cost is conceptual and diffuse, not anchored in a single forfeited path or crystallized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph crystallizes Elara's stance—"her work was just beginning"—and reweights the opening void (geese departed, bakery vanished) as "a space filled with potential." Cost is conceptual and felt (acceptance of ongoing care vs. despair) but not enacted in a decisive on-page action. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; one meaningful deepening (journal discovery) tightens the thematic question. The lens holds, but the cost remains oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Elian works methodically from start to finish without a reversal, complication, or shift in options. The final paragraph asserts closure ("he had conjured meaning...his own vow to memory complete") but no on-page cost or decisive change is dramatized; the library "sighs," stakes dissolve, and the work is simply done. Under any lens, the ending lacks the felt or visible price required for valid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors appear early (market, pier, Elara), satisfying the test. However, the climax—trust breaking between Silas and the agent—occurs off-stage while Elara passively listens; her "thwarting" is observation, not causal action. The watch fob's sound-capturing mechanism is introduced as magical belief without cost or constraint, and the resolution (Silas undone by his own greed) happens independently of Elara's tactics. The "false starts" method is mentioned retrospectively but never shown shaping a live choice. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she departs with the captured sound), but the cost is conceptual at best and the causal linkage from her actions to the outcome is tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is adequate (who/where/when by ~120 words). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elara "realizes" people carry weather because they are "part of the earth's living system"—but this arrives through the man's exposition rather than dramatized discovery, breaking causal linkage. The dominant lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture (aurora, elections, ring) yet resolves via causal explanation that was never set up as a question Elara could test. Cost is asserted ("futuristic nostalgia," "bittersweet") but not visible in a foreclosed path or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (charcoal artist, crowded gallery, subterranean cave). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: descent → discovery → sketch → release. However, closure leans on summary ("creativity flowed back in a torrent") rather than a decisive on-page image or action that makes the before/after legible with visible cost. The painting-niche revelation and combination memory provide a causal link, but the final reweighting occurs off-page in "the days that followed," diluting immediate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a causal progression: map discovery → decipherment → journey → archive activation → realization. Closure arrives on-page when Aria understands lost conversations are stored and commits to inscribing them, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her purpose. However, cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option is dramatized in the final beat. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture, held consistently but not tightened with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density and metaphor build toward a final image. However, the closure moment (the symphony restores wonder) lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized, only success affirmed. The iceberg fragment "glistens more brightly than ever" as acknowledgment, but this celebratory image carries no felt price or constraint, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim. Causality within the accumulative frame is clean, but the Cost Proof Test fails—no on-page sentence makes a sacrifice or limit legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (android caretaker, domed rose farm, magnetic shift) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of metaphor and motif accumulates toward the escape, and the final walk reconfigures Kael's state. However, the closure beat lacks legible cost—Kael steps through and the static "resolved into peaceful silence" without dramatizing what was traded or foreclosed. The burn itself is "controlled," removing friction; luck (magnetic wavering) enables the breach rather than earned agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation (courtyard, dawn, Elara) within the first lines. Causality holds: locket → investigation → mailbox → letter. However, the core closure (Mr. Hemlock reading the letter and smiling) lacks visible cost—his emotional release is asserted ("the weight lifting") without a dramatized internal trade-off or forfeited path. The drive lens reads Causal (because/therefore linkage), but the final image does not reconfigure options with felt price; it grants resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs (the locket's key fits the mailbox), but the stakes dissolve rather than crystalize with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows a linear mission template without meaningful causality: Elara arrives, decodes journals, finds the key, opens the door, frees captives. No on-page reversal or deepening alters her options; each step is a success that leads to the next success. Closure reads as mission-complete satisfaction with no visible or felt cost—she stands "serene and defiant, her work complete, her heart unburdened." The orientation test is satisfied early (sunken lab, algae, viewports), but the absence of a stakes test or forecloses path disqualifies high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: coffee grounds motivate the journey, whale catalyzes gravity shifts, exhumation reveals letters that restore memory. Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, docks, dawn, whale-beaching). The closure—memory restoration and peace-making—lands on the page, but felt cost is diffuse: "she felt lighter" and placing wildflowers are gestures, not a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice that reweights prior stakes. The because/therefore chain holds through the middle but the ending drifts toward summary ("her journey was complete") rather than a decisive image or renunciation with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.8)
    No closure effect lands on the page. The prophecy dissolves because Elian performs his method successfully—no reversal, no cost, no alteration of stance or options. The piece declares success ("The prophecy was silenced") without dramatizing a before/after legible change. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the drive lens remains unclear: no causal because/therefore chain, no accumulative density shift, no situational crystallization—only a linear ritual that completes as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through weekly sessions, the seal becomes a teaching instrument, and the final transfer reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive early (rooftop, meteor shower, narrator meets ghost tutor). The closure—Finch dissolving, seal passed to narrator—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the conversation continuing silently is Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeit or tactical shift demonstrates what the narrator loses or must now endure alone. The accumulation pattern is taught and held, qualifying the piece, yet the conceptual cost at closure lacks the sharp proof sentence required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at dawn. Closure effect is present—Elara shifts from isolation to independence—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a single image or forfeited option. The archive action completes in paragraph seventeen yet the story continues for another fifteen paragraphs restating the same thematic claim, flattening the closure beat. Orientation is clear early (velvet garden, twilight, Elara with seashell), satisfying the test, but the middle twenty paragraphs loop thematic assertions without tightening options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who and where anchor early, but "when" remains vague throughout. The closure unit—pressing the thorn to her palm and "drawing it across an invisible seam"—reads as metaphorical gesture without clear stakes alteration or felt cost; the "profound peace" is asserted, not dramatized. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (aurora, stalactites, repeated motifs) but never teaches a pattern or delivers a cadence shift that reweights the stake. No meaningful tightening occurs; each paragraph restates forgiveness without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece claims "progressive disclosure" but presents a linear exposition dump: seashell whispers are decoded without friction, false echoes dissolve conveniently, and no on-page reversal narrows Kaelen's options. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("those who lived truthfully echoed eternally") but the cost is abstract; no visible choice or forfeiture lands in the final image. Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillates between causal claims and accumulative mood—without stabilizing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story is a summarized chronicle spanning years with no continuous present scene. Orientation is vague (when does the action occur? where exactly are the port towns?) and no single beat receives dramatized pressure. Closure is asserted—"restless energy finally calm"—rather than shown through a decisive change with visible cost. The piece reads as backstory plus recap, never landing in one pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    No decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs; the protagonist's stance at the end is identical to his opening frame. The piece reads as a single extended meditation without escalation, reversal, or causal linkage—paragraphs could be resequenced with minimal impact. Orientation is adequate (who, where, when established early), but the accumulative lens never tightens or reweights: fireflies, tea, nets, and moon paths are serially described without cumulative pressure or a closure image that reconfigures meaning. Cost is absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Orientation anchors arrive adequately (wasteland orchard, post-liquidation, Kaelen searching). The reassembly of letters provides a causal spine, but the leap from "letters about stillpoint" to "the orchard *is* the stillpoint" feels asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive on-page action. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Kaelen holding the diamond as winds return—but the cost remains vague ("risk another liquidation, or bear the burden alone") without a visible on-page consequence that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece summarizes years of monitoring, then compresses "descent," "council," and "final hours" into told sequences without dramatized beats. No single on-page reversal narrows options; Elara's broadcast interpretation and decree are recounted, not shown, so causality remains outline-like. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds her place between ancient and new), but the cost is asserted ("no longer lonely but not quite belonging") rather than legible in a concrete image or forfeited choice. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (observatory, radio, unclear stakes) with no payoff, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the poet captures fragments of melody in jars, accumulating a "choir of silenced voices." Orientation is clear (vagrant in feral loft at dawn), and the music-box jarring sequence provides a coherent through-line. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—he ends exactly as he began, walking toward "the next sound," with no visible sacrifice, altered tactic, or crystallized stance. The final image ("pocket full of captured dawns") is lyrical but does not reweight prior material or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the opening anchors place and character but withholds concrete stakes until well into the piece; by ~120 words we lack clarity on what "destabilize" means in actionable terms. The drive lens appears causal but the linkage is weak—rogue vibrations threaten → Kaelen hums → problem solved, with no on-page reversal or cost that narrows options. Closure lacks felt cost: the key warms, the ice steadies, and Kaelen smiles; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "vibrational matching" method appears as a label rather than a dramatized cause-effect chain with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful escalation occurs; the piece moves in a steady declarative march toward a predetermined collective ritual without reversal or deepening. Orientation is present early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake), satisfying that test. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (collective liberation), but the cost is asserted ("quiet decisions that had finally broken the old yoke") rather than dramatized—no specific renunciation, forfeiture, or visible price appears on the page. The "patient revolution" remains an abstract claim, not an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: investigation → discovery of ledger → confrontation → escape with evidence → reforms. Orientation anchors are present (Elara, tunnel, post-drought) within the opening. However, the closure—Elara walking away with the lantern glowing—reads more as summary ("the leaked evidence sparked reforms") than a dramatized cost on the page. The final image gestures toward liberation but does not make the price or consequence viscerally felt in the ending beat itself. The lens appears Causal, but the ending paragraph tells rather than shows the transformation, weakening the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increase and pattern break reweight the dominant stake). Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the chaplain's declaration to learn and the final repaired heart represent a renunciation of passive guilt with visible cost (time, effort, renewed advocacy). However, the entire middle—learning to repair—is summarized in two sentences ("over the following afternoons, she guided his hands"), eliding the on-page struggle and tactical adjustments that would charge the ending. Cost is asserted more than shown; we are told he worked with "deliberate care" but do not see a single failed attempt or trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece orients who/where/when promptly and infers Accumulative/Textural as the dominant lens. However, closure fails the cost test: the "bell ringing" and algorithm falling silent are told outcomes without a visible price—no foreclosed path, no tactical shift, no felt consequence. The algorithm's "purpose finally achieved" asserts resolution rather than dramatizing a reweighting with on-page cost. The final image (Elara soaring, smiling) offers a thematic echo but no decisive change or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: archival fragments build toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first third. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—deleted files "go into the silence between the notes"—but the cost remains abstract and declared rather than dramatized in a choice that forecloses an option. The investigation sequence accumulates clues (numbers, patch, messages) with causal linkage, but the final turn is a thematic summary rather than an on-page action or renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens infers as Causal, but key links are weak: Kaelen "senses" the solution via half-remembered lore, glides to Driftwood without obstacle, and the mirror-reconstitution method materializes without setup or cost. The orb's restoration and the leviathan revelation feel adjacent rather than because/therefore. Closure—freeing the creature—occurs off-page in summary ("directed the orb's light downward, soothing"), so the Decisive Change lacks on-page enactment. The "weighted breath before reply" with the shop owner promises a pivot but delivers none; she validates him, he succeeds, tension evaporates.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with recurring images (parasol, ice, trawling) building toward the final realization. However, closure arrives as articulated insight ("endings have a sound—a soft, almost imperceptible rustle") rather than a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The piece teaches its meditative pattern early, but the ending tells the thematic arrival instead of charging it through a final concrete moment. Orientation is clear; causality under this lens is gentle but present.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, when anchor by line 2 (pass). The piece follows an accumulative/reflective lens, but no on-page event forces a change in options or forecloses a path. The sentinel's "transformation" occurs entirely in retrospective summary; the burned letter and vines are observed, not handled in ways that alter his stance with visible cost. The ending offers thematic restatement ("embrace both the matches and the mismatches") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt price, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence shift or pattern break should reweight the dominant stake—here the repeated abstractions flatten rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes a quest (preserve echoes) that proceeds through a sequence of contemplative actions—sensing, conjuring, consecrating—without reversal, complication, or cost. The kinetic parapet rises and settles on cue; seekers arrive in summary. No decision narrows options or changes knowledge under pressure; the protagonist's work succeeds exactly as intended. The ending summarizes legacy rather than landing a closure image with felt cost, reading as thematic assertion rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: photographs accumulate, residents gather, community shifts from suppressed grief to "solidarity." Orientation anchors arrive early (lavender field, factory ruins, map case). The fatal flaw: no on-page closure moment with legible cost. The exhibition opening and Mr. Hemlock's gratitude are told outcomes, not dramatized reversals. "The collective healing had begun" is assertion, not an image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph offers lyric summary ("lavender whispered secrets") where a resonant reconfiguration should crystallize. Without visible cost or a decisive image, closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (scholar, library, dawn, post-dictionary age) and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (crystal work accumulates toward pattern revelation). Closure exists—Elara finds her voice and testifies—but cost is asserted ("reticence...daunting") rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or tactical change accompanies the speech act. The pattern of crystal tapping and fractured-echo documentation builds density, yet the final beat ("words came slowly...then with growing confidence") summarizes the decisive moment rather than dramatizing it, weakening the RR/DC legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the protagonist forgets his purpose and sits "strangely serene" without dramatizing what was surrendered or paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending abstracts the realization ("to capture the sound was to lose its essence") rather than landing it in concrete image or consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; the prophet's situation at the end is indistinguishable from his state at the start, and the cost is told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image and motif (spinning hand, foundations shaking, leaf-fall trigger) toward a reconfiguration where the clock stills and the flare is captured. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, Elara, tremors) arrive early. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the clock stops, the flare is trapped, foundations still—but the cost is asserted ("luminous ache," "transience") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page. The final third recycles thematic statements without tightening pressure or revealing new consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and maintains clear orientation. However, the closure lacks felt cost: Alistair's peaceful death and Lena's gratitude offer symmetric satisfaction without foreclosing a path or reweighting prior material with visible price. The causal chain (blood work → message → reunion → death) is linear but unearned; the vinyl and message solve the estrangement they did not help create. The final image (broken vinyl as wholeness) is asserted thematically rather than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately by the first paragraph and follows a causal chain: key → automaton → orrery adjustment → ritual → entity release → key breaks. However, the closure unit (broken key, resolve to continue) reads as setup for a sequel rather than a present decisive change or reconfiguration with felt cost. The "sealed awakenings" framework and shadow-dimension discovery unfold through exposition rather than scene pressure, and the final image of Elara smiling and resolving to continue does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost—it restates her starting curiosity. Drive lens: attempted Causal, but the ending drifts toward summary statement.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established early (secret garden, after substitute body found). However, no causal linkage drives the plot—Elara's actions (clutching tooth, gathering herbs, burying tooth, performing ritual) unfold as a ritual checklist without reversals or meaningful tightening. The closure (tooth dissolving into fireflies, "sorrow turned to wonder") is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt, but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated; no option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, but pressure does not deepen—each beat repeats the same emotional register without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the grotto descent, polishing process, and memory-resurfacing build density toward a stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening window. However, the closure lacks decisive cost—Elara's decision to share the glass with villagers is framed as relief rather than renunciation or trade-off. The ending image ("true light needed no flame") summarizes theme rather than presenting a final moment where options narrow with felt price. One meaningful deepening occurs (the glass transforms, memories integrate), but the final beat resolves through contemplation, not a visible forfeiture or reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara, data center, post-confession). The accumulative lens is signaled through the icicle-drip pattern and sustained to closure, where the pendant exchange and shared pact constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallized, cost felt in "protected vulnerability" and the future's uncertainty). The cost is legible in the line "They had taken the shattered pieces and begun a mosaic" and the acknowledgment that old wounds remain real. One minor seam: the transition from solitary reflection to Leo's presence feels compressed, though spatial logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (collecting ephemeral hopes), but the closure—stepping from the nexus "ready to write"—lacks visible cost or a felt reconfiguration; the final line asserts resolution without demonstrating what was traded or foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive immediately, satisfying the test. The piece teaches a pattern (capture → solemnize → repeat) but does not deepen or break it; each cameo is interchangeable, producing outline-like accretion without escalation. The ending tells transformation ("no longer conflicted") rather than showing a decisive image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "verdant arbor" remains generic and the motivating decay/blight is told, not shown through prior failed attempts or visible consequences. Closure reads as Decisive Change (arbor restored), but cost is absent—no path foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The inferred lens is Causal (songs → restoration), yet the because/therefore chain is mechanical: she sings, the vine glows, life returns, with no complication or narrowing of options. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara sacrificed or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is adequately anchored (orchard, crater, Elara), but no decisive change occurs—Elara begins with her craft mastered and ends having executed it successfully. The ritual proceeds as planned without reversal, complication, or cost; the "urgency in the air" dissolves uncontested. Closure reads as task completion rather than a reconfiguration of options or meaning. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the final image ("map pulsed softly") reasserts the premise without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elian gathers observations across dawn/noon/dusk and the text accumulates echoes and vessels. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure unit—timer repaired, echoes stored—lands on the page, but cost is conceptual and diffuse; no live option is foreclosed in the final image, and the coda ("In the years to come") extends beyond the ending beat, weakening the cadence shift required for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece orients who and where early (Elara ascending to the bronze grotto), but "after the first snowmelt" remains vague and the when anchor is weak. The narrative unfolds as a catalog of burdens calcified in sequence without causal linkage or meaningful reversal; each burden appears, is woven, and is placed aside without altering subsequent tactics or deepening pressure. The ending asserts closure ("her task was complete," "enriched by the journey") but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The drive lens reads as intended Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or visible cost at closure; the carving is "complete" and her heart "a little lighter" without any on-page trade-off or foreclosed path. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early). The causal lens is ambiguous—carving unfolds as a series of meditative statements rather than because/therefore linkages, and no reversal or tightening narrows options. The kettle's boil functions as a timer but does not force a choice or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (scavenger at lagoon edge, post-carousel halt) arrive early. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: fragments of overheard stories build density until the ghost encounter triggers a shift in acceptance. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance replaces pursuit), but the cost—what Elara actually forfeits by leaving the wheel—remains conceptual and asserted ("ambitions transformed") rather than felt on the page. The "because/therefore" linkage from collected fragments to final peace is weak; the ghost grants resolution without prior dramatized resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is adequate (civil engineer intern, abandoned spaceport, post-carnival) by the opening. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal hums with life, a new narrative crafted from broken pieces), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path is visible. The "equations he developed" and "blueprint for other derelict places" are told outcomes, not dramatized stakes that narrow options. The final image (sextant on a pedestal, terminal whispering possibilities) reweights prior material with thematic density but lacks a felt price that makes before/after legible with embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when anchored by ~100 words). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of abandoned dream), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—no concrete forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with atmosphere and reflection building toward the final understanding, yet the "peace" and "serenity" are declared in summary rather than shown through a decisive image or action that reweights prior material. The clock's ticking and Elara's smile function as symbols but do not carry visible or felt consequence that changes what she can or will do next.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection and insight around the sundial until Elara concludes the architecture of lies was designed to misdirect. However, the closure effect—her realization and the act of closing the sundial—lacks a legible felt cost on the page; she "feels a peace settle" and "no longer wandered," which reads as emotional summary rather than a visible forfeiture or charged crystallization. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a price is paid or an option foreclosed at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive reasonably early, and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, knots, fulgurite building toward manifestation). However, no on-page cost is legible at closure: the weavers simply grant knowledge, Elara records it, and walks away enriched without sacrifice, refusal, or foreclosed option. The "profound shift" is told, not shown through a choice or renunciation that alters her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, the ending recapitulates rather than reweights, and the cost-proof test fails—no sentence demonstrates what she paid or lost to receive this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story provides orientation (traveler, garden, autumn, post-departure timeframe) early enough to avoid penalty. However, closure relies on summary epiphany rather than a decisive on-page change: "she understood that healing was a journey" and similar reflective statements replace a dramatized shift in stance or options. The weft thread projection creates vivid images but does not narrow Elara's choices or foreclose a path with felt cost. The ending offers thematic recapitulation rather than a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material through image or action. No single moment crystallizes cost or alters what Elara can or will do next.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece establishes a causal chain—discover egg, theorize its potential, assemble device, activate—but the escalation is mechanical: each step succeeds without meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. The closure unit presents a Decisive Change (bird emerges, sings, reawakens beauty), yet the cost remains abstract ("could not last forever") rather than a specific forfeiture or trade-off legible on the page. The inferred lens is Causal, but linkage is thin; success feels predetermined rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intent, but no meaningful tightening or cost accumulates on the page. The graft procedure unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible price—Elara performs the work smoothly, the girl cooperates, and the ending delivers thematic closure via assertion ("somewhere, a scar was singing") rather than a felt reconfiguration. Closure requires visible cost; here the final image recycles the opening premise without reweighting it. The Orientation Test is satisfied early, but the lack of pressure or escalation prevents the closure from landing with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, why she alone can do this, and the nature of the box remain vague past the opening third, though the City setting anchors location early enough to avoid the Orientation Test penalty. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—fragments gather toward the Grand Fountain climax—but the closure (box opens, memories flow, fountains fill) lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The "sidereal patience" wait for stars and alignment mechanic arrive late and resolve without friction, reading as convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (sonar pings, falling petals, the gear) and a pattern of decline is layered across the narrative. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara encodes the garden's story into sonic echoes, crystallizing a legacy moment where "troubling serenity gave way to hope." Cost is conceptual and felt (the garden fades, an era ends), legible in the final third. Orientation is delayed: "who" is clear early, but "where" (a nebula garden) and "when" (timeframe measured in eons) remain abstract past the 120-word mark, warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor by ~120 words, but "when" remains vague (recent village losses, "days," dusk recurring). The accumulative/textural lens is inferred from the butterfly-ribbon-poetry pattern, but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara moves through the greenhouse observing parallels without facing a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("grief was not a void but a network") but the cost is asserted, not dramatized: no visible sacrifice, renunciation, or transformed relationship appears on the page. The phrase "her task as a carver now infused with deeper meaning" summarizes change rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring motifs (pendulum pause, inscriptions, absolution) layer toward a final image of harmony restored. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elias's decades of service are declared redeemed, but no on-page choice forecloses a live option or exacts a felt price in the final beat. The ending summarizes transformation ("a man reborn") rather than dramatizing a decisive reconfiguration, reducing closure to assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara decodes the tapestry and commits to honoring the stories. However, the orientation anchor is delayed—"who" is clear early, but "where" (cemetery silo) and "when" (after Mr. Hemlock's death) remain vague until the second paragraph, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The closure lands with thematic weight but lacks visible cost: Elara's decision to "carry that torch forward" is asserted, not tested by a forfeited option or on-page sacrifice. The causality is mostly linear summary rather than motivated turns.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a closure unit with visible cost. Kaelen writes a meta-narrative, the lake cracks, he smiles—but no decision alters his options, no renunciation forecloses a path, and the "transformation" is narrated as already complete rather than dramatized with felt price. The orientation is delayed: we learn "ignorance cartographer" and his method in the opening, but who he is as a person, what immediate choice he faces, and what failure would mean remain vague past the 120-word threshold. The inferred lens wavers between Accumulative (he maps ignorance, writes a story) and Causal (models predict outcomes), yet the ending does not tighten or reweight under either—it simply asserts success. No meaningful because/therefore linkage drives the middle; instead, we get a meditation on method followed by a declared win.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The story accumulates texture through recurring imagery (dust, mist, glow, ember alcove) but lacks a single meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options with on-page cost. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the alcove as sanctuary, dust glowing with "secret luminosity"), but the transformation is asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive beat that forecloses a prior path. The pirate broadcaster's direct address ("To the listener in the mist") provides a micro turn, yet the stakes never crystallize into a choice that visibly alters Elara's options or imposes a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the piece builds through ritual action, mixed ash, and a final portrait that reweights the mirage of safety). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance replaces the mirage), but the cost remains abstract—"weight lift" is told, not shown through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The ritual deepens symbolically but does not narrow Elara's choices or impose a felt price on the page, limiting closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who and where by line 2, satisfying the orientation test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; Elara's final action (uncovering a brass plate) is another beat in an ongoing task without visible cost or altered options. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural (layered archaeological work, recurring cog imagery), but the ending does not reweight prior material or deliver felt pressure—it simply restates her resolve. The closure unit is missing; the story loops rather than closes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elara's search for the rosette builds through reflective density toward the rehearsal's charged moment. Orientation anchors cleanly (library, autumn, Elara by ~80 words). However, closure cost is implied rather than concretely legible—"not perfect, but...honest" and "certain that harmony was possible" soften the ending rather than crystallizing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. The rosette's discovery and deployment feel inevitable in hindsight but lack a meaningful turn or tightening that narrows options; the choir's transformation is asserted ("One by one, they began to sing") rather than dramatized with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of metaphor (greenhouse, seed, pruning) accumulate toward the sprouting climax. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure moment—seed sprouts, Elara smiles—delivers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the "gentle rebellion" succeeds without friction, and the narrative simply affirms her intent. The alignment wanes but leaves "lasting glow," a soft reset rather than a reconfiguration with price. No meaningful tightening narrows options; each beat restates her purpose without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The closure unit—lights restore, Elara smiles at preserved wonder—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt, but cost is invisible: no relationship altered, no opportunity lost, no stance crystallized with felt price. The riddle's mechanics (condensation triggers reboot) are told in a single exposition exchange, collapsing causality into convenient summary. Drive lens reads Causal by intent, yet the problem-solve bypasses escalation—water spray fixes the city-wide failure instantly, no tightening or deepening pressure evident on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract description, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (discovery that displaced objects sanctify), but the cost is asserted rather than legible: Elara's "light heart" and confident continuation suggest no foreclosed path or felt price. The accumulative lens is chosen but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the orris root "remains" as a label, not a charged cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but the closure lacks cost: the statue gains community, renewed magic, and shared consciousness without forfeiting anything. The "cascading revelations" unfold as exposition blocks rather than through motivated discovery that narrows options. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent, yet no density shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake at closure—only additive gains. The ending summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where precisely she stands, and what the staircase concretely is remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "rupture" appears without prior escalation—mathematical proofs are described in summary, not dramatized as attempts that narrow options. Cost is asserted ("she had used the proofs... to accept") rather than felt on the page; no concrete forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. Drive lens drifts between Accumulative (texture-seeking) and Causal (proofs forcing rupture) without teaching the pattern or holding it at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: visions layer toward a thematic culmination. Orientation anchors late (~180 words before "rooftop greenhouse" clarifies location), though the disorientation does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (kindness echoes through time) but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: Elara descends "carrying quiet assurance" with no path foreclosed, no visible price paid. The greenhouse-to-city gaze shift provides a soft closure image, yet because no option narrows or tactic changes, the reconfiguration remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (motif-driven). Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from waiting for external rescue (beekeeper's honey) to self-reliant action (succulent honey harvest), and the baked bread materializes the thaw with felt warmth. The ledger → lens inscription → succulent note → harvest sequence holds causally. Cost is legible: the beekeeper's departure forced the pivot, and the community's near-loss of the custom is visible. Minor slip: the lens inscription discovery feels serendipitous rather than pressure-tested, slightly softening causal tightness at the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly (lighthouse, low tide, clockmaker). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spiraling grooves, yoyo puzzle, radiance flowing through circuits, clocks spinning backward—all building toward the final image of reversed rain and unmoored timeline. However, the closure lacks visible cost; Elara achieves her goal without forfeiture, and "at peace in the beautiful, terrifying chaos" signals conceptual satisfaction rather than a felt price. The yoyo's "final, precise adjustment" arrives without on-page struggle or failure, flattening the turn into inevitability rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the resuscitation context and Elara's baseline state remain vague past the opening, creating a floating quality. The closure unit—throwing the clasp to seal the shadow—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("strange peace," "whole") rather than shown through a forfeited option or altered stance. The drive lens wavers between Causal (clasp action) and Accumulative (paradox notes), settling weakly on Causal at the end without sustained because/therefore linkage in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered sound-making actions toward a final protective sphere. Orientation anchors who and where early enough, though "the one known as" delays proper grounding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wave harmonized into the symphony), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—the prophet "stands panting" yet the orchard was never truly threatened, undercutting stakes. The "restless energy" and "uneasy harmony" are asserted rather than earned through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the watchers' nod and Kaelen's new role reweight the opening dread without requiring the gate to open. The cost is visible—isolation persists, the expedition remains suspended—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with pattern-density building to the whistle sequence and vision. Orientation anchors early (city, turtles, gate, watchers). One meaningful deepening: the discovery of dissonance → whistle → vision. The causal chain is clean, though the vision's mechanics lean on the fantastical and could use one more grounding beat to make the watchers' purpose legible before the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (historian, disused station, illuminated letter) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Causal: Elara seeks proof, finds the marginal "veritas," and completes her mission. However, the central reversal—discovering the hidden word—feels convenient rather than earned by prior tactical struggle; the letter simply yields its secret when examined closely. The closure offers a Decisive Change (truth rescued, name redeemed) but the cost is abstract: no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, no tactical trade-off. The "profound peace" and mission-complete frame suggest resolution without friction, which weakens the felt weight of closure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of Elias waiting with his completed work, but the cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt—"interlaced absences" in himself is asserted, not shown through a choice that narrows future options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images of submersion, notes, and the inkwell build density, yet the ending offers restatement rather than a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with on-page consequence. The drawbridge framing promises situational pressure (locked in) but never tightens tactics or forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara builds a tactile map in darkness, and the discovery of contradictory scrolls reconfigures her understanding of the codex. Closure lands on the page—she finds fragmented origins and stamps them as a claim of rediscovery—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("her very definition of truth") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical sacrifice. The escalation is methodical but the final image ("smiled") undercuts the felt weight of what she has overturned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and murky; who/where/when remain vague through the opening third, requiring reader assembly from scattered fantasy nouns. The closure—shadow merging with her feet—arrives without causal linkage to prior gem-polishing or crane-folding beats; the piece declares the ritual complete but does not dramatize a choice, renunciation, or cost that makes the reunion legible as earned change. Drive lens wavers between accumulative (polishing, folding repetition) and causal (ritual completion) without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off the ambiguity at closure. No visible price or option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Causal lens holds: Kaelen's method (perturbation theory via geode) triggers the feedback loop, which produces the darkness that catalyzes his realization—a Resonant Reconfiguration where his understanding of loss transforms from "pooled" to "woven into reality." The cost is felt (he remains "adrift" but with "devastating emptiness filled with terrible, luminous clarity"), and the closure reweights his entire hunt. One meaningful deepening is present and the ending reconfigures options with legible philosophical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who Kael is and why he's at the observatory emerge slowly without immediate anchoring. The plot follows an and-then structure: launch drone, collect data, recalibrate, pull lever, decode frequency. The closure ("you have found what was always there") lands as a told epiphany rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The pilgrim's reappearance to narrate the resolution undercuts agency and replaces scene pressure with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (guilt accumulates through objects and shore setting until acceptance). The closure effect—Elara's decision to stop manufacturing false memories and dispose of the watch hand—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with stated cost), but the cost is told ("heavier in heart") rather than made visceral in a final image. The single-shard shore visit provides one meaningful deepening, yet the link between finding the carving and the decision to change feels asserted in summary rather than earned through causal pressure or a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbolic gestures (drawer pull, moon phase, mist) toward a quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is adequate—who/where/when anchor by the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's lightness, the symbolic weight of the drawer pull reweighted), but the cost remains conceptual and thinly dramatized; we see her "feel" lightness rather than witness a foreclosed path or a tactical price paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael admits his loss, but the negotiation itself proceeds without a credible reversal or tactical tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (coastal launch, solo voyage). The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: Kael's decision to launch despite the broken compass, the wave that costs him the tool, and his shift to utility poles form a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the broken navigator "no longer broken, just changed") with visible cost (compass lost, expectations collapsed). The cost is legible in the final image, though the ending paragraph tells more than it charges. One meaningful tightening (wave → compass loss → acceptance) is present, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece sets Leo at an underground lake by the first third and signals a journey structure, satisfying orientation anchors. However, the Drive Lens remains ambiguous: the newspaper-clue framing suggests Causal, the bioluminescent lake description leans Accumulative, yet the climax—Leo throwing the ball and speaking to his reflection—lacks because/therefore linkage or a pattern-taught cadence shift. The closure unit (Leo accepting his past and feeling "fragile empathy") is asserted rather than enacted with visible cost; no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters tactics. Under any lens, the ending summarizes change instead of demonstrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, orchard, post-phoenix). A single meaningful tightening occurs: Elara must embrace metamorphosis to cross the scented bridge. The closure—Elara's permanent transformation into a guardian of thresholds, bond reforged—lands on the page with cost (loss of human form). However, the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt; the final paragraphs summarize the new existence rather than dramatizing a moment of renunciation or choice that makes the price immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The glade setting, the saucer, the tablecloth, and the cartomancy spread accumulate toward a final image where Elara weaves a thread into the cloth and achieves peace. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early enough. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance and wisdom), but the cost is told ("no longer perplexed but accepting") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or changed stance that alters her situation. The crack-as-gateway and thread-weaving feel more like symbolic fulfillment than a tightening that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (steward, recycled spaceship, photographs). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers shimmer-traces and attempts to "stitch" them into a key. However, the closure—a door that simply opens after prolonged effort—lacks visible cost or a clear before/after in her options or knowledge; she steps through without forfeiture, friction, or conceptual price. The final paragraph asserts "homecoming" and "healing" but does not reweight the prior material with undeniable pressure, reading more as declarative summary than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, causality is fatally undercut by coincidence-as-resolution: the landslide detour, the prophecy fulfillment, and the volcano's "gentle awakening" all occur without protagonist agency or motivated linkage. The closure unit—Elara's realization and departure—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized (she leaves empty jars but gains "profound peace" with no visible forfeiture). Under a Situational lens, coincidence may complicate but cannot resolve; here it does both, breaking the lens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who and where within the first paragraph, meeting orientation minimums, but the closure unit—pamphlets distributed, revolution "inevitable"—declares success without on-page cost or a decisive change in Elara's options or knowledge. The blackout functions as convenient cover rather than a pressure that narrows tactics; once she begins moving, no reversal or complication alters her plan. The accumulative lens is suggested by the recurring images (sundial, quill holder, "cradle of sparks") but the ending asserts transformation ("the people would never be the same") instead of dramatizing a reweighting with felt cost. The "winking hush" tone and recurring motifs gesture toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final image—Elara waiting, the fort asleep—leaves the consequence off-stage and the cost implied rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: visions guide action, rock placement enables the aurora beam, energy flow leads to comprehension. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. However, the closure—Kaelen's understanding and the curse lifting—lands as a clean victory without visible cost; the "lingering promise" is fulfilled by success rather than by a trade-off or foreclosed path. The frictionless world remains unchanged, yet Kaelen's internal shift reads as pure gain, weakening the closure's felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. However, the closure depends on a stranger materializing from shadows at the timer's ding—a coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational and causal lens rules. The "vigil in pause" premise is told but never shapes on-page tactics or choices; it remains thematic decoration. Cost at closure is asserted ("masks must slip for healing to begin") but not felt—no option is visibly foreclosed, no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is prompt: philosopher, atrium, mechanical arm, sundial puzzle by ~100 words. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("we seek the same truth") but the shift from rivalry to collaboration is told rather than shown—no on-page cost, no foreclosed path, no tactical trade-off. The scroll's content ("philosophical accord") is summary, and the fencing becomes pure metaphor without causal escalation. The inferred lens wavers between Causal (sundial puzzle solving) and Accumulative/Textural (philosophical debate motifs), landing weakly on neither; the ending asserts harmony without dramatizing the price or crystallizing new options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, rusted library, moonlit night) arrive early. The piece accumulates motifs—moon, poems, coffee tin, rebuilding—but the closure lacks a decisive reweighting or cadence shift that imposes felt cost. The ending recycles the opening image ("As the moon cleared the skyline once more") and restates intent ("they would return, always") without altering options or stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; the narrative circles rather than deepens. Cost is asserted in theme ("beauty was not despite the anarchy—it was because of it") but not dramatized in a final image that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a causal chain: Elian theorizes escape → finds the frame → plays the chord → steps through. However, the closure—Elian remains in the ballroom with a "new time" on the clock—lacks visible cost; we see no dramatized price for this refuge, only assertion that "his fate successfully, if briefly, surprised." The phrase "if briefly" gestures toward cost but does not show it on the page. The drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (the arbor's failing protection, the horizon inviting night), but the ending image ("peace he had carved for himself") tells rather than demonstrates what was sacrificed or transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the plot unfolds as a because-less checklist: Elara seeks a spot, dreams, interprets, plants, harvests, stores. No genuine reversal tightens options—the tree "assists her," the fruits glow on cue, and the monsoon's threat dissolves off-page without forcing a trade-off. The closure lacks visible cost; she feels "peace" and "renewed clarity" with no path foreclosed or price paid. The inferred lens is weakly Causal but the linkage is declarative rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors setting and situation early, but closure relies on summary realization ("It was then that he understood") rather than a dramatized moment where cost is legible. The compass quest structure sets up causal linkage but delivers conceptual repricing through reflection instead of on-page action. Under an Accumulative lens, the tides-of-remembrance motif recurs but does not tighten options or impose felt cost at the ending. The locket appears conveniently to solve a problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change—Elara escapes with the portrait, feeling luminous disbelief—and cost is legible through the depleted moonbeams and imminent danger. The causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, such as the flower codes guiding her actions. Orientation is clear early, anchoring who, where, and when. No major causality breaks, but the trap resolution relies slightly on convenient moonbeam use, slightly dampening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Elara abandons the control room, feeling "weighty lightness."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative lens holds strong, building through small victories to a resonant reconfiguration where the garden's response proves her point. Closure lands with cost in the polished marbles and the visitors' realization, orienting early and maintaining coherence, but a slight ambiguity in lens persistence prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change—the axis realigns and stories flow—under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the bronze quiet now "full of whispered histories." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the displaced axis shapes tactics and the final image, ensuring coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: daily returns, observations of dust, and the flood’s aftermath build toward a quiet conceptual shift. Closure is clear—a resonant reconfiguration where the flood is re-priced as process rather than tragedy, with a modest internal cost. Still, there is essentially one extended reflective beat; structural turns and on-page choices are minimal, so momentum feels more essayistic than narratively pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is legible: an attempt on her life → retreat to canyon → use of ledger and frost → discovery of the rival → choice of future stance. Structure is simple but coherent, with a clear closure beat when she decides to use the “scorched testament” for creation rather than revenge. The rival-artist reveal feels too convenient and under-dramatized, more told than earned through concrete investigative beats. Stakes are largely retrospective, so the present-tense plot feels low-pressure despite the solid causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: moving from set-up (winterglass, tuning forks, Great Quietening) through the procedural middle (heat-mapping distinct emotions) to a closure beat where the conservatory becomes a “stage” and silence is reconfigured as instrument. Causality is internally coherent—each step (choosing a fork, mapping memory, re-framing silence) follows from the last—and the capsizing backstory cleanly motivates the present method. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to both silence and her trauma is different by the end, and the cost (living with grief rather than erasing it) is legible. Structure is somewhat monotone in action (no major turn beyond deepening of the same act), which limits the sense of decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: package → journey to the coast → descent → research → repair → transformed beacon and release of souls. Orientation is strong and the global drive is clearly causal, with a decisive change at the end that reconfigures both the world (souls released) and Elijah’s state. The main weakness is convenience: the key method arrives via dream, and the research is summarized rather than creating concrete setbacks or choices on the page. Closure still lands with cost (time, risk, and relinquishment of his old role), but the middle lacks structural complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent, with a clear frame from the arbor to the declaration and brief “days that followed” coda. Under an accumulative/situational lens, pressure builds modestly through the repeated runs and the mystery of the donations, but there is no strong tightening turn—events proceed smoothly without setback or on-page threat. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration when Elara shifts from “survive” to “build a future,” but the cost of that pivot is lightly sketched. The sanctions and secrecy remain largely static background conditions rather than engines of evolving complication.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: past-life memory → journey to viaduct → camera and breathing reveal → discovery of the tear → recognition of stored love → release and self-healing. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after reconfiguration of her relationship to the past-life ache. Closure is on the page and conceptually legible, but the path from discovery to resolution feels almost frictionless, with no real setback or complication once the premise is activated. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, and it holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is coherent: cursed fragment → trapped in retrocognition → redesign via hyperbolic geometry → bridge disintegrates → loop breaks. The story lands a clear Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing as she reframes time and gains freedom, and orientation is strong from the first paragraph. However, the path from insight to solution is smooth and slightly schematic—once she “realizes” the fractal nature of time, the resolution follows without significant complication or setback. The cost of success is more implied than dramatized, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wall fall → puzzle/guard conflict → vault access → planting → liberation, with a clear before/after anchored in the wall and the chains. Closure lands via a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration (seeds in soil, chains loosening), and the story respects its own rules. However, every problem is solved on the first attempt with minimal friction—the decoding, the guard, and the vault all yield too easily—so structural turns feel preordained rather than hard-won. The world-scale stakes are declared but the on-page test of those stakes stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure reads as an accumulative, single-arc lyric: she comes to the greenhouse, works, reframes her method, and succeeds. Causality is soft but coherent under this lens—each step (collecting absences, observing cell division, refining the device) leads to the eventual prototype. However, “Finally, she succeeded” functions as a summary leap rather than an embodied turn, and the cost at closure is largely conceptual. Closure is present (she completes the quest and reweights absences), but the decisive change is more told than felt in a specific, anchored beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: flower codes guide her to the portrait, moonbeams reveal the future, the black orchids signal a trap, and her reinterpretation of the flowers enables escape. The scene maintains a single through-line under a causal lens, and the closure—a successful theft with the jar nearly empty and quest ongoing—reads as a clear before/after. The cost is present but modest, mostly logistical (spent resource) rather than a deeper structural or relational shift. Structurally, it’s tight and publishable, if not yet startlingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: one continuous scene where working the glass leads to a reconfigured stance and departure, with no orientation issues. Causality under a textural lens is coherent—the furnace, sphere, and bookmark gradually reweight her relationship to control and letting go, culminating in her leaving the control room. Closure is a credible Resonant Reconfiguration (she exits with a newly flexible heart and ongoing mission) with a modest but legible cost. Escalation is relatively gentle; there’s no strong hinge beat where an option truly narrows in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: discovery of stolen lineage → betrayal by Silas → child with coded cast → decryption reveals trap → Leo reframes trap into stage for his own agency. Closure is a clear Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing: Leo redefines his fears and walks away from Silas’ control. However, the climax at the clock tower is rushed and somewhat expository, with the confrontation reported in a few lines rather than dramatized at the same depth as the build-up. Cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt; Leo succeeds without a tangible on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: she arrives, performs a ritual, completes the map, and departs, all in one continuous scene with no orientation issues. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens: stillness and attention lead to the booklet’s activation and the map’s emergence. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR—her obsession is fulfilled and she departs at peace—but the cost of that fulfillment is not strongly foregrounded. The piece risks feeling like a single extended beat rather than a progression with a decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-time experimental ritual framed by a brief setup about the second chance program and the memory-wipe procedure, building toward an on-page closure where J-7’s understanding of thought is reconfigured. The accumulative/textural drive (repeated loops, increasing density of recollections, culminating in amalgamation) is coherent and easy to follow. However, escalation proceeds without real setbacks or complications, so the path from intention to success feels linear and low-friction, limiting structural tension even as closure is conceptually sound.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is coherent: accusation → Elara’s investigation → discovery via tickets/lens → confrontation with Marco → public clearing of suspicion. Structure is essentially linear with some summarized aftermath, and closure is solidly on-page (mistrust to trust, lens restored as symbol). However, the turns resolve quickly once Marco appears; his confession feels convenient, with minimal resistance or complication. The overall drive is clear but lacks a sharper, more pressured pivot at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/lyric structure: rituals, images, and assertions build toward the public demonstration with the skeptics. Causality is light but present—her long-term care leads to the maze’s responsiveness, which then undercuts the luck-measuring devices at the end. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing: effort and relationship with the garden reweight the premise of measurable luck. Still, the before/after divide is muted because opposition is weak and the “cost” of her stance never feels sharply defined.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: quiet window → alignment of the nexus → lever pull → holographic proof → shared realization. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in terms of knowledge (time as sideways) and relationship tone. However, closure carries little cost beyond “now they know this,” so the decisive change is more conceptual than dramatically weighted. The scene is structurally sound but lacks a sharper consequence or complication that would make it feel fully vital.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean causal line: water on the program → emerging code/map → encounter with the ghost → disruptive act that releases him. It adheres to an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with each new image (stains, instruments, water) deepening understanding rather than introducing new rules late. Closure is solid: the ghost is released and Elara leaves reoriented toward her own composing, with the decoded program in hand. The main weakness is that some turns feel conveniently frictionless (the map and ghost’s pointing solve problems quickly, with minimal resistance or ambiguity).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wake from fever → attention to illustration → confrontation with missed details → integration of Bloom and sensor data → revised stance on prediction. Causality within this lyric frame holds: her micro-discoveries (insect, correlations) motivate the shift in method and belief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with a before/after in how she treats error and truth, and a modest cost in relinquishing the fantasy of control. The stakes are primarily internal and local, but they are coherent and fully resolved at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tunnel exploration → ghost-shift sounds → discovery of the valve → radio method → confession → realization → symbolic closure by replacing the valve. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing where the ghost shift is redefined as trauma rather than the supernatural, with Kaelen altered in understanding. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow, though the perfectly timed confession on the radio feels a touch convenient. Still, the before/after line is legible and the conceptual cost (decades of unspoken guilt/trauma) is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The circular structure (library → origami passage → refuge → return) is clean and legible, with a clear before/after stance that qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the restlessness leads to the journey, which leads to renewed perception. The closure cost, however, is soft and mostly implied—weariness and the burden of endless witnessing—so the final re-seeing of decay lacks a sharper hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The drive is accumulative/textural, building around one core event (the eclipse session) and then telescoping forward to its long-term effects. Causality is coherent—Elara invites Leo, plays, shares the curl, and this leads to his reawakened wonder and eventual return with his child—so closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is present. However, much of the narrative is told in summary (“Years later…”) rather than dramatized, so turns feel low-impact and the cost of change remains abstract. The structure is clear but safe, with little sharpening or reconfiguration in the final beats beyond confirming what we’ve been told from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure—probing deeper, finding the diaries, decoding the tapestry, building the device—reads coherent and leads to a recognizable closure where the axis is “re-aligned” in perception. However, several links feel conveniently elided: the device appears without prior set-up, the decoding of the tapestry is summarized rather than dramatized, and the causal mechanics of realignment are hand-wavy. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing (old dreams reconfigured as living memory), but the cost and constraints shaping that closure remain soft and abstract, keeping this below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is legible and coherent: prophetic fortunes → Leo decodes microdot → journey to lighthouse → joint decision to expose the network. However, the story reads like a compressed outline of events rather than dramatized scenes, so turns land intellectually more than viscerally. Closure does exist (they move from isolation to shared mission), but the cost of that choice is abstract and never concretely tested. The drive lens is Causal and holds, but escalation and consequence feel largely hypothetical.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: a creeping possession threatens the anchor; Elian deploys loops and rhetorical devices; each question conceptually weakens the entity until it fragments. The scene is continuous, well-oriented, and culminates in an on-page decisive change with the anchor settling and peace rewoven. However, the “before the possession completed” clock never meaningfully constrains tactics, and the entity’s resistance is mostly abstract, so the sense of earned difficulty is muted. The closure lands, but the cost and narrowing of options could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure—collecting and scoring memories until she conducts—builds coherently to a clear closure in which she attains her goal and reconfigures her relationship to the past. Causality is simple but intact: mapping memories → forming symphony → conducting at dawn, with the exhaustion clock and approaching sunrise giving light pressure. The piece fulfills an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, though it lacks a sharp mid-story turn or complication. Closure (her achieved conducting and eased homesickness) is legible and on-page, with mild but present cost (spent energy, collapse into rest).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—tablet → changing viaduct → progress through the labyrinth → stitching timelines—is coherent and leads to a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end. The “between the drop and the ripple” frame provides a loose structural clock that returns at key beats. However, much of the journey is told in generalized terms (“The procedural generation continued… presenting new challenges and old memories”) rather than through distinct turns, which flattens escalation. Closure is present and legible, but the path there feels more outlined than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal line—cavern visit → broken needle → backward playback → sensory/emotional reconfiguration → next-day application in teaching—with no orientation issues. Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: mounting sensory-vibrational detail and motif layering (silence, seasons, drums) reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reconceives silence and music, with a visible cost in the tears and the need to face buried emotion. The brief teaching-room coda reinforces the before/after without diluting the prior climax.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: being followed → pigeon/message → data anomalies → visitor from the zone → alliance and plan. Closure functions as a concise Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s operating mode and options are redefined by choosing collaboration, with world-level consequences summarized. The main weakness is that the unmasking of the rogue zone and associated danger are relegated to summary, so the cost and payoff feel somewhat abstract. Still, within the single-scene window, structure is coherent and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a coherent causal arc: commission → greenhouse → UV setup → vial opened → memory/pollen revelation → internal reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a causal backbone, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of what her tears mean. The Lumina Blossom’s transformation provides a simple but effective structural spine, and there are no orientation problems or broken set-ups. The only limitation is that the pressure around the “critical phase” never quite feels like it might fail, so structural stakes stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: one scene, pressure mounting from observation to recognition of distress to the sacrificial act, with clear because/therefore links (rope → memory of escape → moral precedent → new sacrifice). Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: he chooses to unravel his past to free the beings, and the before/after is legible (“empty of his past but full of a new, profound understanding”). The main slip is that the mechanism of how the rope channels “temporal essence” is asserted rather than dramatized or grounded in prior world rules, making that turn feel a bit convenient. Still, the global drive and ending are coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: world-fire → hush → her echo-collecting practice → the deliberate bonfire ritual → realization. Causality is intact and legible, with the bonfire night emerging naturally from backstory and daily routine. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing of silence and the bowl, but the price of that shift is only lightly felt—her grief and loneliness remain mostly abstract. The piece stays structurally sound but never tightens into a truly pressurized decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene with a clean before/after: she arrives as a counterfeit dealer and leaves committed to authentic connection. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: sensing the grotto’s sorrow and gratitude, plus the hollowness of the fake joy, leads to her realization and decision. Closure is clear (she chooses a new path), but cost is mostly implied—there’s no concrete sense of what she’s sacrificing beyond a summarized “cage” of half-truths. The repeated “as the transformation completed” framing slightly blurs the exact peak beat instead of sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a straightforward causal chain—symphony → library → envelope → investigation → meeting Anya → community events—without orientation issues. Closure is present in Elara’s reoriented life and the town’s new rituals, but the decisive change is told in summary rather than felt through a charged scene. Many later beats read like an outline of outcomes instead of dramatized turns, which flattens structural impact. There is no meaningful sense of constraint or risk that would sharpen the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: she hears of the artist, chooses to join the search, guides the group, discovers the tag, and is accepted as a result. Orientation is excellent and the drive lens (causal with a gentle, thematic overlay) is stable. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in social status and a reconfigured relationship to the arbor. The main limitation is that the path from desire to fulfillment is almost frictionless—no serious setbacks or competing options complicate the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: pendant → borrowing time → canals stretching → reaching the spire → uncaging echoes → repayment of borrowed time. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when are legible), and the piece holds a simple causal lens through to closure. The closure beat—echoes freed, world stutters then harmonizes, Elara pays in age and accepts the cost—offers a clear before/after with a felt, if modest, price. The main limitation is that consequences remain somewhat abstract; the world never feels in real jeopardy, so the decisive change reads more mythic than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that causally proceeds from observation (orchard/stone) to experiment (eyes/feedback loop) to payoff (Lyra’s emotional imprint and conceptual shift). The accumulative drive lens holds; each step builds a bit more informational and emotional density rather than sharp reversals, and closure is a clear conceptual repricing (integrating loss rather than solving it). Stakes and options are modest but legible, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The resolution comes a little easily, with no real risk that his attempt will fail or misfire.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine is straightforward and coherent: outage → retrieval of cache → broadcasting → quiet departure, with a clear before/after in his visibility. The accumulative/textural drive holds: each step reinforces the core situation rather than surprising it, but closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration as he returns to the shadows having fulfilled his purpose. Stakes are modest and there’s no serious complication, yet nothing breaks or feels unearned. Structure is linear, clean, and appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: relentless storms challenge her methods, observation of the moss and the tree reframes her understanding, and she alters her stance. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change: she relinquishes her controlling approach and commits to cultivating a resilient, adaptive garden, with on-page cost in abandoning a lifelong philosophy. The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative: continued storms and damage force a new stance rather than a single inciting event. Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, though escalation is more steady than sharply stepped.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: insomnia → painting/haunting → decision to follow rain → discovery of the convergence → brooch → encounter with Elara → exchange → reframed relationship to his insomnia and island. Closure lands as a clear reconfiguration: he reinterprets insomnia and isolation as resources for meaning-making and connection, with the brooch and Elara’s story as catalysts. Cost is subtle but present—he gives up the brooch, offers a painting, and lets go of some protective cynicism—but the stakes remain introspective and gentle. Structure is straightforward and appropriate for the length, though the arc verges on too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: Elara arrives, the pearl ritual begins, unseen forces manifest, and the relationship between Kaelen, Elara, and the cave reconfigures. The drive feels mostly accumulative/textural—each magical intensification (shadows, rain, spirits) deepens the same premise rather than narrowing options. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: Kaelen’s stance toward unpredictability shifts and Elara becomes integrated into the cave’s magic. However, cost at the end is conceptual and lightly sketched, so the before/after doesn’t land with the weight a top-tier piece would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: exile’s end → archival investigation → discovery about the ship and the valve’s meaning → public ceremony and renewed bond. Time jumps via summary (“Over the next few days…”) are handled cleanly, and the closure beat (the trumpet sounding) offers a clear before/after. The missing-ship mystery resolves rather easily, and the reinterpretation of the exile as “forced silence, not a punishment” feels more stated than hard-won. Structure is solid but not bracingly tight or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: dare → follow arrows → reach vault → use punch → revelation → return changed, with no orientation issues. However, the path is almost frictionless, with no meaningful setback, complication, or hard choice; each new element appears just in time to do exactly what’s needed. Closure does land—the quest goal is achieved and her stance after is clearly different—but the cost of that closure is gestured at rather than dramatized. Structurally it’s clean but feels outline-simple for the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear: discovery of the tile, ritual transcription, visionary experience, and communal sharing in the tower, all under a single continuous time-frame of the migration night to dawn. As an accumulative/textural design, the story builds through repeated acts of tracing, visions, and ambient whale-song toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara’s stance toward the “unheard symphony” shifts. Causality is straightforward—tile activation leads to visions, which motivate her invitation of the villagers—and there are no orientation issues. Closure lands conceptually rather than dramatically, with the main cost being Elara’s relinquishment of purely empirical certainty, which is present but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: solar storm + bored immortal + cursed fragment → spatial mutiny → trap revelation → battle for control → implosive reset in an “ordinary cave.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he doesn’t get the answer but his relationship to eternity meaningfully shifts, and the cost (loss of the escondite, amulet, and his prior stasis) is legible. Structural weakness lies in summarizing key turns (“he channeled…what he saw was”) instead of dramatizing decision beats, which flattens peak pressure. Still, the scene holds together as one continuous, traceable escalation under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: inheritance of the ink pot → study/waiting → decision to influence the chief → meeting → asylum. The drive lens reads as Causal with a clean closure beat when Leo redefines “breach” as mental rather than physical and receives news of asylum. However, the ink pot’s power feels like a convenient rule that works on first contact, with little on-page uncertainty or risk, softening the sense of earned difficulty. The embassy and its security are mostly gestured at rather than concretely challenged, so the operation feels relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—night ascent, dawn ritual, descent and workshop codas—flows cleanly, with a legible before/after in the charged, cyclic closure. Causality is simple but intact: he climbs to gather textures, performs the hum-charting, then translates that into manuscripts. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise image (his endless, solitary task) with some cost implied, though the price is underplayed rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wandering/collecting → poison label discovery → intensified search → overheard officials → identity revelation, with a clear before/after. Causality within the lyric frame holds, and the closure—a reconfiguration of his understanding of self—lands with cost. Some key turns (“weeks passed,” “he had a breakthrough”) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens immediacy. The overheard exposition from officials is slightly convenient but still plausible within the port setting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a coherent single-scene accumulation in the observatory, with anchored objects (cello, compass, seashell) and memories threading through to a clear closure beat. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through layered recollection and musical action until Elara conceptually re-prices the riddle and her life’s work. Causality is soft—beats follow more by thematic association than hard “therefore” turns—but the throughline (retell quest → realize riddle is her journey → lay down compass) holds. The cost is evident in her acceptance of incompletion and ending her active quest, even if it’s understated.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: ships approach, she executes a tactical graffiti action, and we end in a charged poise with her commitment to continued resistance. Causality is straightforward and coherent under a situational lens; her mission, the deadline, and the act of encoding a meeting all link logically. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she doubles down on her path with an implied cost. Still, escalation is mild and the decisive change is more about reaffirmation than a sharply reconfigured situation or knowledge state.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene built around a countdown (vials → dawn → photograph) with a clear before/after anchored in the crater’s impending destruction. Causality is straightforward and coherent; each step follows logically from her stated goal and tools. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she completes the vigil, captures the “ghost,” and seals the evidence with felt loss. The main limitation is that the plot never truly complicates her plan—no meaningful obstacle or change of options beyond the inexorable clock—so the arc feels more observed than dramatically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is clean: drone arrives → diagnosis via refraction → patch → test flight → ship guided safely, and the story ends in a clear new state. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main scene and a brief exit to the depot, and closure is on-page. However, the ticking clock of the Aethel’s departure never really constrains tactics or forces a compromise, so pressure remains mild. Several lines restate the same stakes and goal, giving the middle a slightly outline-like feel rather than a tightening one.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: falcon’s return → phrasebook and condensation decoding → walk onto the ice → discovery of the fissure → reflective return. Closure is solid as a quiet reconfiguration: he finds the source yet realizes it doesn’t resolve his existential worry, which reads as an earned, if subdued, cost. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, but the path to the fissure feels almost too smooth, with little resistance or complication testing his drive. The “singular convergence” pays off conceptually, though more concrete consequence would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival in the abandoned town, ritual intensification, and the revival as closure. Causality is simple but coherent—each use of the tuning fork and rhythmic walking leads to a more awakened town. Closure lands clearly with the town’s figures returning and the collapse “averted.” The main limitation is the absence of complicating turns or setbacks; the ritual proceeds almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dwindling oxygen → puzzle → sanctum → capture hush → escape, with no serious orientation issues. Closure is solidly on-page: he secures the hush and survives, recontextualizing the distress signal as emotionally, not plot-wise, central. However, the middle lacks a complicating turn: the mechanism challenge resolves without reversal or credible risk of failure, and the distress signal setup never meaningfully re-enters the structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine—reach the beacon before the bodies are found so he can reconfigure the prison through his story—is clean and holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The labyrinth rules (lies/half-truths, myths sustaining impossibility) are abstract but consistently applied and drive his tactics at intersections and with the lattice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the prison’s impossibility wanes, wardens dissolve, and the structure reshapes to let him out just as the bodies are discovered. The cost is legible but lightly sketched: he trades the sustaining myths (and spectral wardens) for a harsher, truer order that also exposes his crime.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: ghost’s visits → bead offering → memory awakening → orchard’s transformation → debt repaid and release. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive reconfiguration of their situation and a visible cost (her departure, his solitude). However, escalation is gentle and somewhat repetitive—many passes of haunting and remembering without added complication—so the midsection feels more like reinforcement than tightening. Structurally sound and publishable in many venues, but not structurally remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and linear: she enters the labyrinth, moves to the central chamber, sews, and restores the place, with a clear before/after at the final stitch. Causality holds in a mythic/lyric register: her sewing, guided by the plate and sleepwalking paths, awakens the labyrinth. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ruin to reverence—with some conceptual cost (time, effort, relinquishing the plate) but no deep on-page sacrifice. Escalation is slight but present as she progresses to the damaged heart of the labyrinth and completes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: purposeful wandering → discovery of orchard → excavation → sundial → gnomon fragments → revealed tree → vessel → scrolls → restoration of faith. Structure is linear and easy to track, with one major tightening when the rebuilt sundial’s shadow points to the specific tree. Closure lands clearly: the faith is conceptually and practically rekindled, and the orchard’s meaning is redefined, with Elara able to leave. The main weakness is that almost no obstacles or reversals complicate the path; the weeks-long excavation is compressed into a mostly frictionless montage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear before/after—letter unprepared vs. coded, sealed, and mailed. Causality is straightforward (she deciphers, encodes, verifies, mails), and the closure beat of dropping the letter plus the “codes will be activated” line provides a modest resonant reconfiguration. However, nothing in the sequence meaningfully complicates or threatens her objective; the “silent war” and compromised Orion remain hypothetical. The result is coherent but low-tension accumulative texturing rather than a strongly shaped arc with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from quiet investigation to revelation to interruption and a decisive final act. Causal links are coherent—her embroidery work leads to discovery, which leads to recognizing the captain’s role, which precipitates the candle-extinguishing decision. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she forecloses the option of safe anonymity in favor of active intervention, with real implied cost. The only ding is a faint sense of contrivance in the perfectly timed arrival and conveniently revealing gaze of the captain.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within its mystical frame: shard + moonlight → evocation → messages → chamber → decision, all in a single continuous scene. The closure (choosing forgiveness) is unambiguous and fully on-page, with the labyrinth’s parting and inert shard marking a decisive change. The drive lens is situational/accumulative: pressure accrues through repeated evocations and messages until stance crystallization becomes necessary. A minor limitation is that the external hazards of the labyrinth never seriously threaten or complicate her path beyond atmospheric guidance/misdirection.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative frame: anesthetic-induced suspension in the atrium, then deepening into the Kaito memory and the symbol-by-symbol decoding, culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration about understanding as action. Causality is modest but coherent under a textural lens, with each decrypted mark advancing her emotional state toward closure. The final recognition of the two figures holding hands provides a clear before/after shift with cost (reframing helplessness into a different kind of responsibility). The main limitation is that escalation is very gentle, so the middle can feel more like sustained mood than developing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: explore ruins → discover fragment → decide to “display the truth” → build the light installation → experience reconfigured relationship to the fog. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure beat where she reconceives the fog as canvas and carries the fragment away as a promise. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with pressure deepening via increasingly rich images of the past. Some late-paragraph reiteration of the same insight slightly blurs the structural snap of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is accumulative: coin discovery → experiment with crystal → perception of nested awakenings → final relinquishment of certainty, all legible and causally linked enough for a lyric piece. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing where her role and the garden’s purpose are redefined, with a clean before/after. However, the pressure on this shift is low; options never feel narrowed by genuine risk, and “infinite wonder” arrives without a strong sense of what is truly being forfeited. The nested awakenings motif substitutes for deeper complication rather than escalating through genuine constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal sequence is clean: warped greenhouse and misaligned patterns → discovery of audits → reinforcement attempt → enforcers’ arrival → sonic disruption and escape. Orientation is strong; we always know where we are, who is present, and what they’re doing. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: their network survives another night and Elara recommits, but the victory is somewhat easy and the price of the encounter is light. The warping tech explanation is handwavy yet coherent enough not to break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: we move from long, mostly solitary labor to the wind returning his lullabies transformed into earthly armistices, then to his final rest. Cause-and-effect is soft but traceable under a textural lens—the repeated patterns (writing, wind, postcard, armistice) tighten toward a closure image with cost (he dissolves into his work’s impact). There are no major orientation issues; the shell, the poet, and the postcard are stable anchors. Still, the pressure curve is gentle, and the centuries compress into summary rather than a sharply marked hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: crack threatens library → lore about the song → search for the tablet → song repairs the chime. Structure is straightforward two-beat (spire → archives → spire) and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Closure is on-page and legible, but the resolution feels somewhat low-friction, as the search yields the exact needed tablet without setbacks or surprises. The cost of success is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: need to restore trust → use truth-ink and promises → glyphs respond → archive transforms → Kaelen arrives as closure. The piece maintains a single clear scene and a dominant drive, with the dawn deadline lightly but coherently framing events. Closure is on-page (the silence breaks and their paths won’t diverge), but the cost of success is somewhat underplayed; the magic works smoothly with no significant setback or risk realized. Overall structure is solid but a bit linear and low-friction for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrival → measurement → discovery of the envelope → decoded message → revised plan → recalibration and softening of the amphitheater’s “breath.” Closure is solidly on-page with a before/after: the volcano’s rhythm gentles and Elara leaves with changed understanding. Still, pressures rarely corner her into difficult choices; setbacks (like the stronger tremor) are brief and easily overcome. The drive lens reads Causal with a lyric tint and remains coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara’s guarded routine → repeated visits from Leo → disclosure of her history and the meteorite → discovery of the letter → confrontation and joint project to preserve the songs. The story offers a clear before/after, culminating in a Decisive Change where she accepts the truth of her past and commits to shared preservation work. However, much of the middle (“over the weeks…”) is summarized rather than dramatized, so individual turns feel smoothed over instead of sharply staged. The coincidence of Leo conveniently discovering the crucial letter strains pressure slightly but doesn’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: terrace → bench/logbook analysis → threshold encounter → crossing and reframing, all under a stable internal drive. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines herself from lost to architect/keeper—with the before/after legible. Causality is soft but intact, with each step reasonably flowing from her interpretive work rather than arbitrary revelation. The main limitation is that the cost of this change is largely conceptual and underplayed, so the final turn feels more serene than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: arrival and work → discovery of feather → research logs → bioluminescent “fireflies” → realization at sunrise. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the feather and logs reweight the bioluminescent display and her sense of belonging. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing—she reframes what “belonging” means—but the cost is muted and the night never seriously threatens to withhold that epiphany. The piece risks feeling like a graceful vignette more than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: Kaelen uses the crater glass and seeds to investigate, gains successive glimpses, refines his conjectures, and arrives at a rule about disappearing paths and a new resolve. The structure is linear and legible with a clear closure beat (his conceptual reframing of disappearance and his vow to preserve echoes). However, the “before memory fades” clock is asserted rather than dramatized, so urgency remains mostly conceptual. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative texture; it holds, but the stakes and costs stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense performance anchored in the arcade, followed by a reflective walk home and return on the next evening, giving a gentle arc. Causality is coherent—the planned “serendipity” leads to the crowd’s wonder, then to her reaffirmation of purpose—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a quiet reaffirmation rather than a decisive change: she recommits to her ongoing project with the bishop as totem. The main limitation is that the global drive remains low-pressure; the before/after distinction is more tonal than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene that moves from preparation to climax to transformed aftermath. Causality is straightforward—she dances, uses the dust, focuses on gaps, the verse inscribes, she collapses—and the before/after of her role (isolated exile vs. keeper of truths) is legible. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a sharp turn, but the lack of any concrete external complication or real risk (no sense someone might find her, no ritual failing) keeps the escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: harbor → atrium → ritual → light-breakthrough, with the dredging project as a loose temporal frame. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from misted gray to prismatic color is structurally satisfying and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “change” and “value.” Still, the dredging stake is barely tested on-page, so the “before everything shifted” clock doesn’t generate real decision pressure. The result is elegant but a bit low-tension for immediate high-end publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: a single night walk framed by past fire trauma and the recurring box, leading to a quiet internal shift. Causality is simple but coherent—present sensations cue backstory, which in turn reweights the present. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her innocence-pact is re-seen as enabling empathy rather than purely a loss. However, the before/after line is mild; options and stakes feel largely the same, just more consciously framed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: balloons test timelines, patterns are adjusted, feedback improves, and the final pearl locks in a new equilibrium, giving a clear before/after. Causality works under a textural lens, with each iteration modestly tightening toward the closure image of the gauge in the green. However, pressure is low and there is no real sense that failure is possible; escalation is more implied than felt. The closure is resonant but somewhat antiseptic because no evident constraint or price shapes tactics at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: corridor → fireplace → diaries/film strip → realization → redefined purpose, and orientation is solid from the outset. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with the found artifacts deepening the central question. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of her work, but the cost is soft and the path to it a bit too smooth and summary-heavy. There are no significant unkept set-ups or causality breaks, just a relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is coherent and easy to follow: orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the opening and the bell toll provides a clean temporal frame. The progression from silence to song to trembling mirrors to brief visions to their fading gives a gentle, discernible arc. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the terrace has been briefly transformed, then reset, with Lyra slipping away. However, the cost and stakes of success or failure stay abstract, so the final before/after is more conceptual than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: ritual attempt → gathering of clans → activation of celestial power → her life-force sacrifice seals peace, with a clear before/after and on-page cost. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when) and the structure stays within a single, continuous scene that crescendos to closure. The drive is straightforwardly causal with a touch of lyric accumulation around the moons and terrace imagery, and the ending lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. The main limitation is predictability: once sacrifice is foreshadowed, the plot offers few surprises or tactical complications.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual framed by the storm, with backstory interleaved in ways that clarify rather than confuse. The causal chain—he caused the drought, which created the salt flat and map, which enables the ritual of release—holds under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is solid via a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves the egg behind and walks into the storm altered in stance, with the echo now diffused into the world. The main weakness is that many beats feel like variations on the same note, so progression is more tonal than decisively turned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric surface: she enters the courtyard to find the sanctuary, harvests echoes via threads, and that work unlocks the sanctuary, which in turn transforms her stance. Closure is solid—a before/after is legible as she steps back into the snow “no longer just a chaste courtesan,” and the cost of abandoning safety is implied. The escalation in the untangling (toward the “final thread”) provides the key structural tightening. That said, the mechanics of how “harvesting echoes” reconfigures the world beyond her body remain conceptually hazy, keeping the plot from feeling fully concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    Structure is linear and easy to follow: the dome scene frames a reflection on the bar argument and culminates in her decision to revise her show. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, and closure lands via her resolved plan to start with hope and focus on redemption. Yet major conflict beats (the argument, the risky return) are summarized rather than dramatized, dulling the sense of genuine turning points. The cost of her new choice—what she’s risking or sacrificing—remains mostly conceptual rather than concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the grotto → construction of the signal → vigil → encounter with the last monarch → ritual release and departure. Causality is straightforward and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, with the closure beat (untie/release/descend) clearly framed as an ending of this vocation’s particular chapter. The piece does land a Resonant Reconfiguration—his task “complete” and connection carried inward instead of outward—but the stakes remain small-scale and largely symbolic. Nothing crucial threatens to fail; the monarch’s timely arrival feels granted rather than ever in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: Elara enters with a clear goal, engages the rope in a sequence of increasingly charged actions, and achieves closure when the names are released and the card crumbles. Causality is straightforward and legible—each manipulation of the rope leads to clearer sound and brighter aurora, culminating in the chorus of names. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: her world and sense of self shift into a stable, transformed state. The main weakness is that the path never truly narrows or threatens failure, so the causal chain lacks a sense of risk or cost beyond the card’s sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: storm approaching → directive decaying → dream interpretation → realization about paths → using the wafer seal → gateway and step through, with a clear before/after. Closure is solidly on-page via her decisive act of pressing the seal and walking into the storm, with the cost of relinquishing her defined purpose. Structure is single-scene and clean, though some beats (e.g., the nature of “find the chooser”) remain a bit abstract and under-specified tactically. Still, the global drive and its resolution are legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine is clean: Aris enters with goal and tools, uses schematics and tile, triggers the palace’s response, answers the voice, and achieves a covenant that reconfigures the palace and world. Closure is on the page via a decisive change (covenant sealed, palace transformed) and a conceptual repricing (devotion redefined as love of the universe). Still, the stakes tied to “transition between rulers” remain abstract and untested—no concrete obstacle or credible chance of failure is staged once the ritual begins. The cost of success is mostly thematic rather than dramatized through a specific sacrifice or irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal line is straightforward: Elara brings Kael into the sanctuary, uses the cylinder to trigger memories, and he lets go of resentment. Structure is clean (one continuous scene) and closure is legible: Kael changes in a decisive, before/after way. However, the cost of that change remains thinly dramatized, with little resistance or setback beyond brief “Kael resisted” statements. Reality shifts and cellular memory are framed as mechanisms, but they never meaningfully complicate tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear, easy to follow, and the closure is clean: he sets out to capture the dream and succeeds, ending with the mirror as a permanent container. Causal flow is clear—mirrors + sextant + breathing → manifestation → capture—but there is very little complication or reversal, making the progression feel almost procedural. The decisive change (the dream becoming a contained object) occurs on the page, yet the cost and narrowing of options remain soft. Overall it reads more like a well-organized ritual description than a truly pressurized plot.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: exile → cathedral refuge → retrieval of bag → crafting quartz eyes as olive branch → Lyra’s eventual return. Closure is a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration, as the relationship is explicitly healed and their craft renewed. Still, escalation is somewhat soft, with “weeks passed” summarized and Lyra’s dawn return feeling convenient and unpressured by any concrete obstacle or risk, which blunts the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: strange object → inquiry → bathroom insight → deeper inquiry/vision → second bathroom insight → final renunciatory act, with clear because/therefore linkages. The closure is a solid Earned Stasis/RR: she chooses to curate rather than consume or “conquer” forbidden knowledge, returning the object to the roots. Cost is somewhat abstract (“risk unraveling her own past, her own mind”) and never quite tested in scene, which keeps the emotional price conceptual rather than felt. Drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s arrival → need for the Library → the diary → resonance rules → meditative shift → confronting Kael’s unlearned lesson → library access. The story sustains a single coherent drive and lands a decisive change plus a resonant reconfiguration when the mission shifts from “rescue” to “confronting error” and the library opens. Several key beats (the meditative journey, the decoding, the spell that opens the door) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the sense of hard-won progress. Cost is present conceptually but could be sharpened by at least one more concrete obstacle or sacrifice before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a single, linear walk on the ship with interleaved memory, leading cleanly to a non-physical vision of the garden; orientation in who/where/when is strong from the opening. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of narrative threads, the card’s increasing activity, and the thickening fog provide a legible build toward closure. Closure itself—a reconfiguration where Elara integrates her twin and reframes the garden as a tapestry of narrative—is on the page and conceptually clear. The cost of this shift (what she truly loses by letting go of prior self-concepts) remains mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized, softening the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly appears → she tests the seal → opens the void → applies the rope method to stabilize it → closure in the diplomat’s study. Orientation (who/where/what is wrong) is established early and never slips, and the closure image is legible as a decisive change (absence reconfigured into completion). The cost is mild and largely conceptual; there’s no sense that failure would damage Elara or her world beyond a vague threat of instability. Structure is solid and publishable but not yet scalpel-tight or high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean causal arc from disrupted harmonics to ritual intervention to reconfigured balance, with the echo stone and ice patterns serving as coherent mechanisms rather than arbitrary magic. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the caves’ harmonics settle into a new pattern incorporating the beings, and Elara leaves the stone behind, implying an earned stasis with some cost. However, escalation is smooth and largely unimpeded—no reversal or serious doubt about success ever materially tightens the frame—which blunts the sense of jeopardy. Structurally solid and complete, but not structurally surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: world collapse → broken prism → Elara’s long project → present-night attempt → moment of near-failure → beacon rekindled. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the piece fits a single-scene-with-backdrop structure that it maintains without confusion. Closure lands: the beacon physically changes state and her belief about coincidence solidifies in a way that reweights all prior material. The main structural limitation is that the path from intention to success is relatively straight, with no material setback beyond a brief “nothing happens” pause, so escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: he descends, moves through three monuments (each a beat), accumulates insight, and arrives at a reconfigured understanding—an accumulative/textural drive that lands in a genuine closure beat. Causality is soft but intact: listening to specific whispers and observing specific shadows leads to progressively refined conjecture. The before/after shift (nostalgia as burden → nostalgia as “gift”) is explicit and legible. What limits the score is that pressures or alternatives are never sharply framed, so the arc feels like a guided meditation more than a scene tested by constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc: arrival at the fortress → sensing the mosaic note → ignition of the rag → chain reaction of fireworks → emotional and atmospheric shift. Orientation is solid from the opening paragraph and the accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress’s hopelessness is temporarily lifted, the mosaic note “remains,” and Elian walks away changed in stance if not in circumstance. The main weakness is the absence of on-page resistance or complications that might tighten the causal chain and deepen the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure—a single continuous scene unfolding in the suspended time of a conversational pause—is clean and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in the relationship stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: repeated attention to pools, shells, and the cicada gradually reweights “leaving” as “molting/transformation,” culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive act. Causality is modest but intact: Elara’s observational method leads to an insight that then shapes the resumed conversation. The main limitation is that the central conflict resolves without much friction or visible cost, so the closure, while present, feels gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: bunker claustrophobia → predicted inversion → deliberate plan and gear → ascent → trellis encounter → return with vial and reweighted bunker. The global drive reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bunker shifts from prison to charged, bearable space through the acquired silence. Stakes and constraints (time-limited inversion, tether, suit) are clear, though the journey lacks any on-page complication beyond sustained fear, which slightly flattens the middle. Still, nothing crucial teleports or breaks causality, and the arc feels complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric lens: gondola travel + storm glass readings + humming build to a quiet reconfiguration where silence becomes comforting. Orientation is clean, but structurally the text loops—multiple sentences restate that she monitors silence and aims to teach it comfort, with little variation in circumstance. Closure does occur (her relationship to silence is affirmed and slightly deepened), yet there is no decisive turn or meaningful obstacle, so the before/after is conceptually small. It feels more like an extended tone piece than a story ready for a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: archives → waterfall → orchard → pavilion murals → secret passage → stairway → throne. Closure is clear (she claims the throne and gains access to its knowledge), but the path is very smooth, with each new element conveniently solving the previous problem and no genuine setbacks. The “deadline at sunrise” doesn’t alter tactics beyond being mentioned, so cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt. Structurally it’s coherent and functional, but not especially tight or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: encroaching presence → doorknocker resonance → decision to allow entry → shared breathing and conceptual repricing of “burned bridges.” As an accumulative/lyric piece, it holds its pattern and delivers a clear before/after: strict solitude reconfigured into a two-person sanctuary. Cost is present but muted—his solitude is conceptually breached, though the pain of that loss isn’t strongly dramatized. Causality is intact and orientation is sound, but the decisive turn lands more as affirmation than as a pressured, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: Leo’s decision to volunteer leads to the experiment, rising pressure, his interpretive leap about the messages, and the bolt-to-diamond climax. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change with conceptual cost: his trauma is literally reconfigured, the messages stop, and his options going forward are reweighted. That said, the experiment’s stakes feel relatively safe and pre-ordained—there is little sense that failure or annihilation are live possibilities in the climax. Structurally, it’s a clean single-scene arc with no orientation or lens confusion, but the outcome feels a touch inevitable once the rules are explained.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward—he plays the gramophone, accesses memories via “standing waves,” discovers manipulation, and chooses redemption—so the drive lens reads as simple causal with lyric overlay. However, most of the key beats (the conspiracy, his previous decision) are summarized rather than dramatized, which dulls impact and keeps the conspiracy feeling generic. Closure is present (a decisive change of identity and goal), but the cost of that decision is only faintly implied. Structure is linear and coherent but lacks a sharply felt tightening around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: finds program → studies patterns and removes armor → performs ritual as reality shifts → captures possibility and is transformed. The piece follows a single continuous scene under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with a clear before/after at the point he seizes the glowing orb. Closure lands: he becomes “a guardian of potentials,” and the program disintegrates, signaling a decisive change. The main weakness is that the cost and jeopardy of the attempt never feel in doubt, so the climax reads inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—button → letters → research → revelation → display—is clean and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in Elara’s relationship to the archive. The piece achieves closure via a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets dust and files as vessels of preserved kindness rather than mere neglect. However, key turns (“Through further research, Elara found…”) are telescoped into exposition, so the investigative middle feels frictionless and under-pressured. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a light accumulative texture, and that holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal arc is legible: plans to distribute archives falter → puddle map appears → lagoon/phone booth grant access to truths → Kael returns to disseminate them. The drive lens is essentially causal with some accumulative repetition, and closure lands as a quiet earned stasis/charged poise: he commits to ongoing resistance. However, the “plans unraveling” and subsequent success are mostly summarized, with no concrete obstacles or reversals dramatized; everything important happens smoothly once the map appears. Cost at the end is conceptual rather than felt, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the ritual is introduced, pressure builds as the atrium “resists,” and closure arrives when the whisper is hushed and Elias departs with awareness the task will recur. Causality is simple but sound—Elias plays in a specific way; the light patterns falter; the grotto settles—and the scene never loses orientation. The closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: today’s crisis is averted, but the ongoing cost is implied in his return “again and again.” Still, escalation is modest and the decisive turn feels more declared than dramatically sharpened, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: leaf-decoding, monuments, discovery of the moonstone dust, communal expansion, and final thematic decoding all build in a consistent pattern. Causality is soft but legible—her prodding and shrine-building lead to shimmering, transformations, and greening of the arbor, culminating in the core message about interconnection. However, there is little sense of constraint or meaningful possibility of failure; every step reliably yields a positive outcome, so closure lacks a felt cost. The ending is conceptually satisfying but structurally safe, reading more as a neat completion of pattern than a hard-earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: rumor → greenhouse key → “ashes” clue → cave → box → compass → grotto maps → internal shift → return. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative patterning of motifs, and closure is a conceptual repricing of time and certainty that lands on the page. However, obstacles are solved with near-frictionless convenience (the perfectly matching key, the compass pointing straight where she must go), so the plot feels more like a guided tour than pressured navigation. The ending does mark a before/after in stance, but with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: failed search → solitary experiment → pushing the coin past limits → fracture → kintsugi repair and realization, all in one continuous scene. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step logically growing out of the last. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “finding” (the man) into “understanding” (the name and the search itself), with the damaged-then-mended coin as the hinge. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, but the before/after is unmistakable and costs (risk to the coin, relinquishing the old goal) are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: arrive at gorge → open spectral channel → confession and laughter → release, with a legible before/after as Lyra is freed and Elara resumes her cycle. Causality holds, but the journey feels pre-ordained—nothing meaningfully threatens failure, so tension is low. Closure is a mild resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn; Elara ends much as she began, with slightly deepened ache. The repetition of summary lines near the end (“her pursuit… her method…”) flattens the sense of progression.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: anesthesia wearing off → orientation in the forest → iterative bracing/memory loops → discovery of the strap → conceptual shift. Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven, but each recurrence of bracing and the eventual physical strap build coherently toward the final realization. Orientation (who/where/why) is clear early, and the closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing with a legible before/after. The cost—living inside trauma until he can reconceive mercy—is implicit but present.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara goes to the market, finds the painting, uses it to access Anya’s erased moment, and returns with a renewed mission. Orientation is strong from the outset and the single transition into the vision is legible. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration—Anya’s story is now “loose, ready to be told”—but the sense of cost is light and mostly conceptual. Structurally, it’s solid but conservative, with no surprising or tightening turn beyond the expected vision-return cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: silence → dust analysis → hidden compartment → mainspring → clockmaker ghost → crack/ceiling → ledgers and other ghosts → promise and release. Closure is solidly on the page, with Leo leaving changed in understanding if not in circumstance. However, the “hours” of listening and the injustices are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the emotional and structural punch of the middle and climax. The overall structure works but feels somewhat linear and low-pressure for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is clean: deciphering the frost → setting the type → uncorking the whisper → rupture → altered ongoing role, with a legible before/after in reality’s stability. Closure lands via a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: the library is permanently destabilized and Elara reframes her goal from control to “dance with its fragments,” with on-page cost in the loss of perfection. Structure is linear and coherent, with no orientation issues and a clear escalation through the rupture. The main limitation is that the path to the rupture is smooth and unresisted, so the climactic act lacks tactical complication even as its consequences are large.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: dispute → new interpretation → experiment with mirror and shard → vision of the past → treatise and presentation → museum coda. Orientation is strong and the closure—a reconfigured understanding of the civilization and Elara’s own failure—lands legibly. However, much of the narrative is told in retrospective summary, so major turns (the dispute’s climax, the presentation) feel compressed and under-pressured. The experiment succeeds on the first attempt with minimal complication, softening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: Elian attempts the repair, the lie disrupts it, truth restores it, and the light returns—so closure (a decisive change in world state) is clear on the page. However, escalation is thin: the threat of failure from midnight and the covenant largely remains conceptual rather than dramatized as a narrowing of options. Midnight never appears or actively counters; the single interruption by the lying townsman resolves very quickly, so the “world in the balance” promise feels under-tested. Cost at closure is minimal and mostly implied effort, which keeps the structural arc serviceable but not compelling at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene descent toward a focused goal and lands on a clear closure beat: she forgoes capture, leaves the compass, and emerges changed. Causality is coherent (archive → compass → visions → lagoon → decision), and the psychometry acts as a motivating hinge rather than a late rule change. The cost is somewhat conceptual—she relinquishes tools and certainty more in idea than in dramatized sacrifice—so the before/after remains a little gentle for top-tier venues. Still, the structure is solid and the final image reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: GPS failure → archway discovery → magic slide visions → decision to carve a unifying piece → internal reorientation symbolized by ignoring the GPS. Structure is linear and legible, with one major tightening as the projections begin guiding her carving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines how she navigates both art and life, with a tangible behavioral shift. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, but they’re coherent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: garden discovery → months of obsession → pavilion/postcards → cathedral window revelation → mural → sharing with children → re-evaluated understanding. Structure is linear with one clear excursion (to the cathedral) and a return, and closure lands via a conceptual reweighting of darkness and beauty. However, the beats feel uniformly smooth; there is no point at which options narrow or a choice threatens to derail her quest. The cost of the journey (time, emotional strain) is mentioned but not dramatized in a way that significantly tightens the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of letters → contact with diary → retrocognitive trap → decoding via debris → return with a new mission. The structure—vision-past shard framed by present zeppelin library—reads clearly and closure lands as a conceptual shift in her role (preservation vs confrontation). However, the “trap” never truly endangers her options, so the pressure curve is relatively gentle. The ending’s Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing is legible but could bear a sharper sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a straightforward causal line from ghost town aftermath to deliberate rebuilding, and closure is clear: the town thrives without wishes, and the bottle is recontextualized. However, structure is heavily summarized—many years and changes are told in overview rather than dramatized beats, so turns feel conceptual rather than scene-driven. The drive lens reads as causal, but escalation is smoothed into a calm progression with few discrete pressure points. Still, the before/after is legible and the closure unit (Conceptual Repricing of the bottle and wishes) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is clean: nightly ritual → recording → emergence of a second voice → prophecy → reinterpretation of his work → new purpose, with no orientation issues. The structure is essentially a single accumulative scene with a short backstory shard that’s well-anchored by the phonograph memory. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: devices that “capture more than sound” are revealed to capture fate, and his archive work is reweighted toward destiny, with the cost embodied in the “velvet disquiet.” While stakes remain mostly conceptual, the before/after is legible and the progression is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain (egg hatches → unstable vortex → entropy-decreasing ritual → portal reopens → Elara steps through) is clean and easy to follow, with a legible before/after at the end. The piece delivers on its promised event—reopening the gateway—with on-page action rather than summary. However, the instability of the vortex never forces a difficult trade-off; the ritual proceeds without a setback or meaningful complication, which softens the sense of cost at closure. The drive lens reads as straightforward Causal, but the decisive beat feels more inevitable than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward: approaching storm → protocol expectation → alternative bell plan → villagers respond → storm hits with preparation. Closure is clean in the form of a decisive change in procedure and a stable new norm afterward. However, much of this is narrated as summary rather than dramatized scene, so turns feel conceptual rather than pressured. The “zero hour” passes smoothly, with no on-page complication that tests or threatens the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric, with a steady build from routine stargazing to a meteor shower that catalyzes Kael’s realization. Causality is simple but coherent: job → practice of tracing stars → journals/philosophy → intensified meteor shower → reframing of self and vulnerability. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where he accepts his role and solitude differently, though the cost is soft and largely conceptual. Structure is linear and clear, but the arc lacks a strong, felt hinge where options or stakes meaningfully narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is clean and the accumulative structure is coherent: ghosts appear, purpose is inferred, the box is used, the covenant is renewed, and the ghosts depart. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the oasis and covenant are subtly transformed and simplified. However, causality and cost are soft; the outcome feels almost inevitable once the box appears, with little sense that things could have gone otherwise. The “tangled covenant” is more declared than dramatized in how it constrains options, which blunts structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: rediscovered capsule → encoded garage-sale messages → contact with Leo → revelation about the urn and time’s nature. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after shift once Elara experiences the “timeless” moment and reframes her role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, and it is legible. The main limitation is that many key turns (e.g., the ancestor’s intentions, the equation’s meaning) are explained swiftly rather than dramatized with on-page difficulty or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure—a single shoreline encounter followed by a return-to-cottage coda—reads cleanly and supports an accumulative, lyric drive. The kite snapping offers a clear inciting disturbance that leads plausibly to the child interaction and then the writing sequence. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: his practice of “harmonizing discord” is enacted with another person, then crystallized in his writing. Still, the causal chain never tightens into a situation with constrained options or visible cost; it unfolds smoothly without genuine structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: diagnosis → plan derived from diary → systematic experimental work → transformed orchard → final quiet vigil and death. Orientation is strong; we always know who, where, and when, and the throughline of “before I die, I will complete this remodel” holds. Closure lands as an earned stasis/resonant reconfiguration: she dies, but the grove’s new state and her last sketch mark a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the middle “days turned into weeks” montage smooths over any potential micro-turns, so the arc feels gentle rather than sharply shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: first-contact frame → artificial pilgrimage setup → journey along the path → tower ritual → revelation and return. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative/textural lens: every step advances toward the biochemical decoding, and the amber reveal cleanly produces a Conceptual Repricing (home as chemical memory, tied to the alien signal). There are no orientation issues, but the lack of obstacles or complications keeps the arc very smooth. Closure does land, with a clear before/after in Elara’s understanding and stance, even if the cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly linear: arrive → interpret birds → plant and bless → depart, and causality is intact under an accumulative/lyric lens. Orientation is clear early (coachman, jetty, dead reef at twilight), and the story holds one scene with coherent focus. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield is now legibly recast as sanctuary, with “submerged concord” made manifest and the coachman departing after his work is done. The main weakness is low on-page resistance or complication; nothing meaningfully tests or modifies his plan once it’s set.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: scrapyard solitude → attempt to play the cylinder → recognition of a riddle → using the leaf as key → discovery of coordinates → decision to set out. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the closure beat—him leaving with a reconfigured relationship to distance and silence—lands as a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. The main limitation is that the stakes remain mostly interior and low-intensity, so while the arc is coherent, it doesn’t quite feel pressurized enough for top-tier impact. Still, for a quiet piece, the beginning-to-end linkage is solid and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: observe shutdown silence → notice anomalous star → investigate via sketching and sensors → decide to reactivate engines and leave. Causality is straightforward and the closure (choosing a new mission) lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a before/after shift. However, external stakes around the shutdown and his “blessed pariah” role remain abstract, so the cost of his decision is more implied than sharply dramatized. Under an accumulative/situational lens the piece holds together, but the pressure feels low-grade rather than truly constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: wrong sky → climb spire → ritual swap + sundial lid → sky mended, with a clear before/after at closure. The structure is a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a decisive change to the cosmos. What holds it back is the lack of complication or setback; the guardian is immediately cooperative, the method works on first try, and no beat substantially narrows options. Cost is implied in the scale of the task rather than dramatized as something Kaelen risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece works as an accumulative/textural single scene: each word she spells (“remember,” “listen,” “forgive,” “hope,” “peace”) adds a layer to her emotional journey. Causality is soft but coherent—her encounter with the chessboard and memories of the plague catalyze the pivot from memorialization to self-forgiveness. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: the pawn-less chessboard shifts from symbol of loss to potential, and she exits with a lighter stance. The structure is clean but the middle feels slightly static, with some conceptual repetition rather than new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: retreat → encounter with stone/feather → iterative nightly work → reconfiguration of her idea of home. Causality is coherent (touching the stone with the feather triggers the language flow; continued seeding leads to the final image), and the weeks-long montage is acceptable at this length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she stops substituting reality, accepts pain as part of home, and walks into dawn with altered stance. The cost—clarity that “hurt but healed”—is on the page, though the summarized middle softens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is solid: he comes to the frozen village seeking absolution, decodes the tapestry, uses it to solve the labyrinth, and gains a reconfigured understanding of his failure. The single-scene structure with one transition (street → hall) is clear, with no orientation issues or broken logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he walks away internally changed, with the objects left behind functioning as proof of that shift. The main limitation is that the “test” revelation and solution arrive smoothly, with relatively little friction or setback before the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene, taught pattern (poem → echo-refracting → deepened meanings), and a clear temporal frame (“before the ritual,” ending on the bell). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: forgiveness redefined from a single confession to a lifetime of carrying refracted truths, with the canyon’s hush “forged” and recharged. Causality is soft but coherent—each poem builds the field of meanings that will make the ritual’s cost heavier—though there’s no decisive, on-page confrontation or choice when the bell rings. Orientation is strong from the first lines; no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: workshop → decision to dive → underwater ritual → near-collapse → successful retrieval of memories, with a legible before/after in the world’s fate and Elian’s status. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with cost (physical ordeal, risk of dissolution), and the sequence is easy to follow spatially and temporally. However, the path is almost frictionless—no genuine reversals, tactical adjustments, or failures, just linear progress with intensifiers—and the acid sea’s lethality is more asserted than dramatized. The result feels coherent but somewhat schematic, with high-stated stakes riding on a relatively straightforward, unthreatened success.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: cracked mirror → renewed pull of the old promise → wrong turn → cave → discovery of the old shell → reinterpretation and renunciation. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after at the point where she decides to leave the shell and return to the quay. Closure is solid (a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing), with the cost implicit in relinquishing her talismanic past. The main limitation is that the journey is frictionless—no real obstacles or alternative options test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: heat wave breaks → she executes a long-prepared ritual → the scented intent reaches her brother → he turns home → she feels the echo. Closure functions as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: her belief is confirmed and his course is literally altered, but the emotional and practical costs (a year lost, the risk he might not answer) are only lightly implied. The structure is linear and coherent, with a brief cutaway to the ship that fits the causal lens. The main weakness is the absence of genuine on-page jeopardy or complication; the ritual succeeds on the first, unchallenged attempt, so escalation and cost feel modest.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: hydraulics fail → isolation → cryptic call with “Build” → construction of the resonator → alignment with Polaris → emotional reconfiguration and realization. Structure is linear and legible, with the reverse migration premise coherently expressed and followed through to closure. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward her grief and the station changes with a visible emotional cost (acceptance rather than escape), and the final recognition of the voice’s source reweights prior beats. The main limitation is that obstacles and alternative options are barely tested, so the sense of narrowing pathways is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: empathy virus → involuntary truth → isolation → smuggled eye → lightning ritual → partial cure, with a clear before/after at the end. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with one continuous build to the ritual and a reflective landing that qualifies as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis. However, the central problem is solved on the first attempt with no meaningful complication or setback, and the “unknown cost” is only gestured at, softening structural impact. For an elite venue, the arc needs either a sharper price or a more complex turn in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: the stranger’s death → Elias’s investigation → inference of lost love → decision to write and mail the letter → reconfigured solitude. Structure is linear with a light reflective overlay, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, fitting an accumulative/textural drive. However, key beats (“He spent days walking the shore…”, the emergence of the woman’s laughter) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens impact and keeps the cost of his choice abstract. The “borrowed memories” verge on feeling slightly convenient or mystical without being fully integrated as a rule of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal line from glimmer → chip → ants → cavern → symbols → doorway → refusal is clean and legible, with no major logic gaps. The ending lands as an Earned Stasis: he consciously forecloses the path of altering the past, and the cost is visible in what he chooses not to do. Structure stays within a single continuous throughline and the closure unit is clear. The piece is solidly built but not structurally daring, which keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal through-line is solid: dreams → seer’s warning → decision to climb → grotto encounter → new understanding and decision to return, with a clear before/after shift. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she reframes herself from disenchanted ruler to guardian of cosmic balance at real conceptual cost. However, several key beats (the seer’s “irrevocable doom,” the kingdom’s peril) are off-stage or summarized, which keeps the plot from feeling fully pressure-tested. The drive lens stays coherent, but the stakes of “celestial collapse” remain mostly declarative instead of being more concretely dramatized in the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: introduction of a decaying nexus, revelation that it is dreaming, Elara’s altered method, and the nexus’s awakening, all causally linked. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in both the nexus’s state and Elara’s role (“guardian of moments”), with a conceptual repricing of the nexus’s meaning. The cost is mostly conceptual and vocational rather than dramatically dramatized, so the stakes feel modest rather than urgent. Structure is coherent and uncluttered, but the turns are gentle and somewhat predictable once the premise is established.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: cabin frame → involuntary soaring dream → return and inscription → quiet reconfiguration. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: the grave dream and chronological confusion build pressure that makes the act of writing both necessary and costly. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the grave’s meaning shifts from fate to material for narrative, and the “weight” lifts slightly. The only limit is that external stakes or alternative paths never fully crystallize, keeping the conflict entirely inside his head.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: visit to the shop → symbolic gift and reframing → application of the new method with a client → widened closing perspective, all under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality holds without gaps, and the closure (Elara’s redefined practice and identity) is evident on the page, with the screw and fog reweighted at the end. The cost—relinquishing her old scent-based identity—is implied rather than fully dramatized, making the decisive change more contemplative than pressured. Still, the single through-line is coherent and proportionate for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene ritual progression—preparation, repeated attempts, progressive softening of the runes, and completion of the ceremony—with a clear before/after. The accumulative/textural drive lens works: each breath, rune, and superstition layers toward a final reconfiguration where stress becomes artistry and scars become stories. Closure is on the page (the platform steadies, storms still rage, she feels an inner calm), but the cost and risk of failure are kept mostly in the realm of implication rather than dramatized consequences. Causality is coherent, though some beats feel like reiterations of the same move rather than distinct structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: commission → setup in the archive → induced currents + perfume → manifestation → apology → partial response → emotional softening. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s atmosphere changes, Elara departs, the orchard is cut but the haunting is eased. Still, the path from problem to solution is almost frictionless; the ritual works on the first attempt with no substantive complication or tactical adaptation. The cost—trees lost, love partially reunited—is conceptually strong but the on-page sense of “this might fail” remains muted, keeping it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: he moves through the library, studies the mural with the dictionary, unifies meanings, and the library dissolves as closure. Causality is simple but functional, with a clear before/after in which knowledge external to him becomes internalized. However, the middle feels like a loop of similar beats (walking, reading, arbitrating) without a strong structural tightening or complication, and the cost at closure is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: whistle → calibration ritual → counting backwards → noticing the gear teeth → auxiliary adjustment → conceptual realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of repetitions (counting, squinting, horizon, water clocks) builds coherently toward the final repricing of what clocks measure. Closure is present and legible—the “before” is conventional timekeeping, the “after” is clocks as resistance and human desire—but the shift arrives smoothly, with little sense of struggle or price paid. Causality is intact and orientation solid, yet the climax reads more like a graceful essay landing than a pressured narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is coherent—alert → investigation → communication → system update—and the single-scene structure is clear, with no orientation issues. However, the revolution of the entire system happens almost frictionlessly once she interprets the entity as communicative; no serious obstacle or complication tests the choice. Closure exists as a conceptual and procedural change to the security system, but the cost of that decision (risk to the farm, possible failure) is only gestured at, not dramatized. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal with thematic repricing), but escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: heart attack → subway decoding → library → journal → decision, with a coherent accumulative drive toward understanding and reorientation. The causal chain from cryptic scrawls to library to journal is legible and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her father’s legacy. However, there’s little real resistance or complication; the “quest” unfolds almost frictionlessly, more reflective than dramatically shaped. The cost is present but largely internal and could be tightened by one sharper on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single phone call forms the spine, with the “loop” as the central device and a quiet but legible closure when Elara’s stance shifts and Leo returns to waiting. Causality is simple but intact—her wrong-number call leads to Leo’s intervention via the disc, which leads to her reframed understanding. The story reads more accumulative/lyric than strongly causal, yet the before/after of the call is clear and there is visible emotional cost in Elara’s pain and Leo’s chosen solitude. A slight outline-like tendency in lines such as “This was the method” flattens some of the structural tension into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: council vote → urgency → ritual with locket/ink → covenant regenerated and jetty preserved in memory. Structure is a single continuous scene with one tightening (the revelation of the grandmother’s rescue as the covenant’s origin) and a clear RR/CR-style closure: the jetty is “saved…from being forgotten.” Yet external stakes (demolition) remain offstage and never directly test her tactics, and the ritual’s success feels guaranteed once introduced. Closure lands, but with limited sense of risk or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: rumor → Leo’s arrival → storytelling bargain → transfer of the rock → outward spread → Elara witnessing the result. The shift from the intimate scene to the weeks-later montage is smooth and pays off the premise without feeling like a bolt-on epilogue. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the station and Elara’s role are visibly altered, with the cost of her earlier isolation and ongoing elusiveness still present. Stakes remain mostly internal and thematic, but the structure supports them without confusion or slack.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walk → following notes → threshold in the gully → kneeling, tuning grief. Causality is simple but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure (reframing the stillpoint as inner state) lands clearly with a before/after. Stakes stay focused and there are no orientation issues. The lack of a sharper external complication or risk keeps the plot from feeling fully maximized for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear: past miscalculation → swollen anomaly → penitent log-editing and data-gathering → anomaly’s reply → her calibrating response → partial stabilization and reframed relationship. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with embedded backstory and one major turn at the anomaly’s unexpected transmission, closing in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive fix. Closure lands: she has altered the situation and her understanding, with a before/after that carries emotional cost. Stakes and causal moves are solid, but the on-page sense of what failure would concretely mean (for her body, the station, others) remains soft, slightly blunting the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: advisor appears, teaches and re-frames reality, transfers the tool, then vanishes, leaving Elian changed; under an accumulative/textural lens, this reads as a coherent arc. Causality is straightforward (“I have come to disrupt your isolation” → mapping silence → Elian’s reconfigured relationship to silence), and there is an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration at the end with a felt emotional cost. The piece stays in one scene and never loses orientation. The main limitation is that tension and choice are modest, so the turns feel gentle rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: tapestry fragment → trail of art → decoded self-portrait → hidden chamber → decision to preserve. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with clear orientation and a clean closure unit (his redefined mission and the rescued promise). The problem is near-total absence of obstacles or reversals; each discovery arrives smoothly once he looks, so options never feel meaningfully narrowed. Cost is mostly implied moral weight rather than dramatized constraint or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: repeated cycles of drumming, lagoon response, and cosmic inhalation lead to a clear crest (the garden’s symphony and brief realization of the shared dream) and a quiet earned stasis at the end. Causality is soft but legible—her sustained drumming transforms the garden and reconfigures her role. However, the stakes and constraints around the lab and experiment remain abstract, so the decisive change feels more conceptual than pressured. Closure lands, but with modest on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and clean: storm disables systems → Kael challenges → Elara leads him through the maze → they access the hidden relay → she proves her creed via rescuing workers. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s understanding changes and the world of the story briefly reorients around Elara’s quiet method. However, the stakes are relatively soft—there is little real jeopardy or meaningful sacrifice—so the before/after line, while legible, lacks bite. Structure (one continuous night, clear spatial progress) is solid and easy to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: each patterned light on the water advances toward the softening of the child’s fear and the canal’s calmer “sleep.” Causality is simple but coherent—her weaving of constellations leads to the spirit’s recognition and release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the canal and darkness now “cherish” stars, and the tension drains into a new stasis. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal spine is coherent: grotto → lodestone king → synchronized displays → gradual civic awakening, with a clean accumulative/textural drive and a soft but legible closure (the fulfilled prophecy and enduring movement). However, much of the middle and late “action” is summarized rather than dramatized, so turns happen in exposition rather than live beats. There’s no sharp tightening or surprise complication; everything unfolds as planned with minimal resistance. The closure has conceptual weight but limited felt cost or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: call → mounting pull → threshold at the sublittoral fringe → appearance of the island → crossing and transformation. Causality is straightforward under a causal/lyric lens; each beat follows from the last without confusion, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early. Closure lands with a decisive change—she abandons her old life and the scrimshaw dissolves—though the narrative doesn’t dwell much on the concrete consequences of that choice. The Great Pacification setup doesn’t fully pay off structurally beyond tone, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: one continuous scene where rituals and images layer toward a charged final poise. Causality is simple but coherent—Mandate → mask/rituals → neighbor-reporting and secret sorrow work. Closure lands as an earned endurance in the final still image under the turbines’ shadows. The middle lacks a strong structural beat beyond reiteration, so escalation feels modest rather than sharply shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: he approaches the atrium, engages the humming quartz, paraphrases, boundaries dissolve, then he crosses and the world reconfigures. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—the humming, touch, and paraphrase each link to boundary dissolution—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. Closure is present via a Decisive Change/RR: the ban is revealed as fear-based, the atrium becomes accessible, the lake thaws, and he leaves in a reconfigured world. Still, stakes feel low and largely untested; there’s no concrete resistance or price to crossing beyond inherited taboo, which keeps the structural turn from feeling truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: phoenix → residual magic → courtyard visit and barter → challenge → painting → awakening and epilogue of changed practice. The closure is a credible Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: he abandons the literal quest for color in favor of a deeper mode of seeing, with the living reed as proof. The cost—relinquishing his fantasy of “color vision” in exchange for a subtler awakening—is conceptually present but under-emphasized, and the epilogue paragraphs repeat the same beat rather than adding new structural weight. Still, for this length, the structure is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative arc: repeated experiments fail to yield the desired “texture,” frustration prompts a reassessment of assumptions, and the projection into the atrium produces a reconfigured understanding. Causality is intact and legible at every turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the lab becomes a “living organ,” and connection is reframed as tapestry rather than isolated data. Cost is quiet but present in the long labor and relinquishing of her original, comfortable frame of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative, almost parable-like structure: origami clues → rediscovery of the stencil and grandfather’s legacy → Elara guiding others, closing on a reconfiguration of grief. Causality is present but soft; many pivotal steps (how she moves from discovery to public teaching, how the observatory becomes known) are elided into summary. Closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration is clear—grief reframed as cycle—but there is little on-page cost at the ending, more a serene statement of where she has arrived. The mosaic of coordinates/journals/phoenixes is legible but feels more like a condensed outline than lived-through beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece is structurally coherent as a single, continuous scene in the loft with an accumulative/textural lens, and it does achieve a mild closure as Elara reframes her work from salvaging the past to launching a rebirth. However, the narrative leans heavily on repetitive exposition rather than discernible turns: multiple paragraphs restate that she maps patterns, reverse engineers collapse, and multiplies paths without new consequences. The dominant stake—can she decode the post-crash cultural “fingerprint” in time to avert or navigate a further collapse?—never encounters a concrete test or constraint beyond her anxiety. Closure is present (a conceptual reweighting of crisis into opportunity) but the cost and before/after divide feel somewhat undercut by the summarizing, essayistic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrive at archive → perform risky ritual → succeed and leave changed, with a clear before/after and on-page cost. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the increasing immersion in memories and the ritual’s progression do form a coherent escalation. However, the “steadily unpredictable” danger never meaningfully disrupts her process; there is no hard turn where the outcome is truly in doubt, so the climax feels somewhat pre-ordained. Closure lands, but the lack of a concrete complication or reversal keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: noticing long-term drift → identifying the “shadow unbound” → choosing to metamorphose it → paying the cost in what’s lost. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “hope” with clear before/after stakes around truth vs safety, and the cost is on the page. The structure (brief context → present scene → ritual → aftermath) is tight and coherent at this length. Stakes stay mostly conceptual, but they are consistently tied to her concrete act and to the archive imagery, so the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: one continuous scene in the workshop with layered reflection on the con, building to a stance decision. Causality is clean—the theft prompts this night of reassessment, and the chameleon’s injury concretizes her dilemma. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she chooses to keep answering the door with adjusted boundaries, and the tail’s regrowth parallels that. The main limitation is that escalation remains mostly internal and contemplative, with few on-page complications to pressure her stance further.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: plant-telepathy agitation → coffee-ring divination → discovery of the hollow → root-guided tunneling → crystal and revelation. Structure is linear, single-POV, and the orientation (tower, dawn, post-accident state) is crystal-clear early. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: he reinterprets his wound and gift, with the hourglass restarting as an externalized sign of that change, though the lack of on-page resistance or complication keeps the cost somewhat abstract. The piece feels complete but a bit too frictionless for top-tier narrative rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: projection booth → psychometry vision-realm → return with a new stance, with clear causal links from film strip to vision to resolution. The accumulative/textural drive holds: each beat thickens the concept of stored love and culminates in her decision to act as conduit. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing—unused love is reframed from loss to latent potential—but the cost of that repricing is only faintly implied, not dramatized. The throughline is coherent but a bit too frictionless for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: repeated nights of tracing stars culminate in one “particularly vibrant aurora” and a decisive realization about rest and alignment. Causality is coherent—her method leads to insight and release—and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where creation becomes rest. However, the narrative lacks a strong hinge beat where options genuinely narrow or a previous tactic clearly fails; the epiphany feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The final cadence is clear but low-tension, with cost only lightly implied in the long prior endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV lyric progression: she climbs the dune, deploys her method, works through multiple sparks, and reaches a reweighted end-state as their ignition reconfigures the world’s and her own stasis. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—her repeated acts of “charming” sparks plausibly lead to the collective brightening and the lullaby’s smoothing. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a sharp decisive act, but the before/after is legible (frozen time/emptiness versus charged promise/peace). Stakes remain somewhat diffuse and cosmic rather than concretely tested, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the sixth sense and translocation premise, her method of reading trees, the gear’s directional pull, and finally inserting it to restart the engine all link coherently. The two-shard structure (before sleep at one locus, after at the engine) is legible and supports the closure unit where machine and mind unlock together. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly sketched—there’s no real “lose to gain” beyond accepting strangeness. Strongly structured but not structurally audacious.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: leash breaks → guided traverse via indirect routes → sigil → realization on the shore, with a clear before/after in her relationship to courage and fear. The accumulative, pilgrimage-like design holds consistently, and the closure (recognizing courage as immanent to the journey and within herself) lands clearly with cost in the relinquished old life. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though the middle stretch risks a slight sense of “and then they walked” rather than a sharp tightening. Overall, it's solidly shaped and fully coherent for its quiet aims.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discoloration → bolt → piano → archives → discovery of the tragedy → revaluation of silence → decision to remain. Structure is essentially linear and accumulative, with a clear closure beat in his renewed decision to stay under altered terms (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). However, much of the middle (the investigation and its impact) is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens what could be pivotal beats. The cost at the end is legible but arrives more as explained conclusion than as an on-page turn forced by a concrete moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term message seeding → loyalist discovery → exposure → Theron’s attempt to suppress truth → activation of the rune and fall of the usurper. Time compression over “cycles” is handled via summary without breaking clarity, and the single-scene climax lands with a concrete Decisive Change. The main weakness is that much of the scheming and its risks are recounted rather than staged in pressured beats, so escalation feels somewhat cushioned. Still, the ending’s before/after is legible and grounded in prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—assembling data → recognizing patterns → reframing the atlas and their role—reads cleanly, and the story holds a coherent single-scene structure. Closure is a conceptual repricing: Kaelen’s understanding of loss vs. recovery shifts, and the final “home” moment marks a clear before/after. The cost, however, is more implied than dramatized; their years of drift are told rather than tested in a concrete dilemma. The result is satisfying but not structurally daring or pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: abandoned bay → searching for meaning → discovery of stone circle → entering it → vision/energy wave that promises to reignite the rebellion. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the piece maintains a single continuous scene with coherent stakes. Closure lands via a clear decisive change in Elara’s stance and the rebellion’s prospects, though the lack of any visible price for using the stone’s power softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: plant urgency → kite → decoding → cavern → orb → unsealing → community reform. Structure is essentially linear with one time jump (“spent days cross-referencing”) that compresses without confusing. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when the embryo dissolves into visions and the community’s reconstruction plans are reoriented. The main weakness is how frictionless each step feels—no meaningful setback or resistance, so the arc reads more like a graceful unfolding than a pressured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense scene in the arboretum with flashback memories anchored by bodily sensation and the photograph, culminating in a clear reconfiguration where she chooses to breathe, release, and work. Causality under an accumulative lens holds—aircraft hum → somatic flashback → freeze impulse → conscious thaw → renewed grafting. Closure is legible and on-page, with cost in her deliberate endurance of pain and continued exposure to triggers. The arc is solid but almost entirely linear, with minimal surprise or tactical complication beyond the one main tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure—present in the lighthouse library interwoven with successive “threads” of memory—holds cleanly and builds toward a clear conceptual and emotional reconfiguration. Each recalled commission or failure functions as a causal step in his reassessment of what portraiture and truth mean, paying off in the decisive shift of purpose and the choice to “begin again.” Closure is strong: we feel a before/after hinge when he reframes his role and physically picks up charcoal to map his journey. Stakes remain internal but coherent and consistently tracked under the reflection-led mode.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: eclipse aftermath → experiment setup with ink and drone → disappearance into the time-bubble → realization → return, with no major logic gaps. The structure—the main-world scene framing the excursion into slowed time—fits the length and keeps orientation intact. Closure is present as a conceptual reconfiguration: he answers his central question and forecloses his restless search, but the price for this resolution is underplayed. Because the experiment encounters no real setback or complication, the arc reads somewhat pre-ordained rather than pressure-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward: letter arrives → decision → upload → network response → quiet aftermath, with a clear before/after change in the world implied. Closure is present (she becomes a catalyst and cannot go back), but the story lacks a significant on-page complication or reversal—alarms “should have sounded,” yet nothing actually tests her plan. The piece leans almost entirely on declared stakes rather than structural tightening under pressure. The drive lens reads as causal, but with low resistance and largely conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with orientation and causal links (tower falls → scrap appears → roses change → wanderers arrive) all legible. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, but there is only a mild tightening when wanderers come and take cuttings; no moment feels like a true hinge where options change under pressure. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—her sanctuary becomes a symbolic seed for the wider world—but the cost of this stance is only lightly implied. Much of the piece reads as summarized legend rather than dramatized beats, which blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael enters with a goal, navigates the garden via specific tactics, and captures the echo, which in turn alters the world-state (constellations, garden stability). Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues and a clear closure (Decisive Change plus mild Resonant Reconfiguration of the world). However, the outcome feels foregone; complications (like the star’s disruption) are brief and easily handled. Cost at the ending is implied peace rather than a hard trade-off, which keeps this below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s call → logical decision to test innocence → archive descent and discoveries → return to the dome and decision to confess. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one temporal throughline and a clear Decisive Change at the end (she chooses to publish against her father’s legacy). The cost—destroying the family myth and stepping into a different identity—is legible on the page, even if external consequences are only implied. A slightly sharper sense of concrete risk (what she stands to lose in social or material terms) would strengthen the closure’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: discovery of the letters → amber’s secret → integration with the lab → apology sent back through time → emotional resolution. Structure is linear and easy to follow despite the time-fold conceit, and closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration from torment to earned quiet. However, key turns (e.g., deciding to integrate the amber, composing the apology) are reported in summary rather than dramatized as scenes, which flattens impact and hides intermediate costs. Still, the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from anxious gathering → artistic intervention → emergent hush → reoriented community, all in one continuous scene. Causality works under an accumulative/textural lens: the mandala and tile flake reshape the whispering environment until silence “emerges,” then conversation resumes in a new register. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing of “the mess” and of the Unlearning itself, with a legible before/after. The cost—letting go of fact-based certainty—remains more implied than dramatized, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: plaza → mosaic objects → retrocognitive surge → interpretation of patterns → renaming and partial release. Causality holds under a textural/lyric lens, and the closure beat (the renaming and its effects) is firmly on the page with a legible before/after. The price—continuing visions, but loosened shackles and a new identity—is conceptually clear. Stakes remain mostly internal and the path to resolution feels a bit too smooth, but not enough to undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: preparation with the coin, casting it, building echoes, resistance, then a reconfigured timeline and release. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each sensory and musical layer tightens toward the closing performance. The closure (her fulfilled bow and fading) is concretely on the page and clearly ends her prior state. The main weakness is that “the fractured timeline resisting” reads more as told abstraction than a concrete structural obstacle with tangible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/textural design: static shock → pill effects → geode retrieval → somatic-marker method → light painting → viewing the image → reconfigured stance. Orientation is solid early on, and the single-scene flow is easy to track. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a new, fragile conviction and a concrete artifact to bring to Mara. The cost is relatively soft and internal—emotional exposure and urgency rather than a sharply felt sacrifice—keeping the piece short of elite-level structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: heat-mapping the fossil triggers levitation, which reveals pathways, which lead to a concentrated emotional chamber and culminate in Kaelen’s elevation and role-shift. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after anchored in his new status as “voice of the unknown.” Closure is present but soft; the transformation is largely declarative, with limited on-page sense of price or altered options beyond a generalized new responsibility. Still, under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression of mystical responses to his mapping provides a coherent build to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is clean: we move coherently from intention (alter the prophecy) through method (open jar, catalog buttons) to outcome (hourglass transforms). Causality holds and closure is decisive: the sands change and the rigid prophecy becomes “raw possibility.” However, the path from problem to solution is frictionless; no setback, complication, or surprise interrupts the plan, so escalation is largely procedural rather than dramatic. The cost of success stays abstract, which keeps the closure from fully landing at a higher literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: codes → rendezvous with Anya → plan → broadcast → attack and sacrifice, with clear before/after stakes. Closure satisfies the DC requirement: the evidence is sent at visible cost (Elias’s wounding, implied death). However, key beats—planning, enemy approach, and the broadcast—are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening escalation. Antagonistic forces are generic and mostly offstage, making the climax feel a bit outlined rather than fully lived.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: one continuous scene of waiting and reflection that culminates in the gutters stopping and the decision to fulfill the promise. Causality under this textural lens is steady—environmental cues (fog, ticking) accrue until they trigger a conceptual repricing of his past. Closure is clear and on the page: he identifies “forgiveness, starting with himself” and turns back to the carriage. The main limit is that the path from setup to resolution feels somewhat linear and unsurprising, with no sharp structural tightening beyond the slowing ticks.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: journey → discovery of the glass → meditation/vision → conceptual repricing of “resisting change” → departure. Causality is clear under a textural lens: the glass triggers the thrum and visions, which yield the insight he carries away. Closure is solidly on the page—he gains a new understanding and symbolically accepts a role (lifting the glass, then carrying it away). The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, but the before/after is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: petal falls → she rows → she reflects light → she returns and sees the bud, forming an accumulative, ritual arc with a legible before/after. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she recommits to her work and sees tangible renewal, but this shift comes without any real jeopardy to that commitment. The stakes and constraints are low throughout, so the “because/therefore” chain feels more like “and then” in emotional terms even though causality is intact. Still, the repetition of ritual and symbolic objects coheres under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: memory surfacing → decision to seek the stone circle → visions → reconfiguration of her stance and role. Causality is intact and the closure—accepting coexistence and a guardian role—lands on the page with a legible before/after. That said, there are virtually no obstacles or reversals; every setup (stone circle, sundial) functions on first try, so pressure never tightens. The emotional cost of integration is mostly summarized, giving the arc a slightly preordained, low-friction feel.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: storm → found object → journey to the temple → creation of the labyrinth → communal participation → her inward walk and realization forms a clear accumulative arc. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: the twig spiral motivates the installation, the installation invites whispered secrets, and that density of confession makes her eventual insight feel earned. Closure is strong: her decision to stop hiding behind others’ words and write her own letters delivers a before/after shift with conceptual and emotional cost. The piece stays within one continuous scene with no orientation glitches or unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: community fracture → Aris’s theory → forbidden plan → illicit broadcast → disruption of both cosmic and human turmoil → confrontation with Evans. The piece offers a clear Decisive Change (signal neutralized) and a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (station as “shield,” Aris as “first line of defense”). Structure is tight—one continuous night scene with no orientation issues—and the drive lens stays causal throughout. The main weakness is that the apparent career risk introduced early is somewhat deflated by Evans’s quick pivot to respect, softening the sense of lasting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal spine is clear and linear: organ sound steadies the space, allowing Elara to map, find the keeper, derive the harmonic key, and stabilize the nexus, so closure (Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration) lands. However, many steps are summarized in similar sentences rather than dramatized as discrete beats, giving the structure a synopsis-like feel. There are no real reversals or complications; events unfold smoothly once the pattern is understood, which keeps the drive from feeling urgent. Orientation is solid and the ending coherently closes the quest, but without much structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—evidence vanishes → Elara goes to quarry → she reconstructs the event conceptually—is coherent, and the ending does offer a conceptual repricing (reframing the death as accident and empathy failure). Structure is linear and clear, with one continuous scene at the quarry braided with case context. The main weakness is that the crucial “realization” about the pull-not-push and relationship dynamic reads more like authorial deduction than something concretely earned from the on-page evidence. Closure exists but feels somewhat under-tested by concrete obstacles or alternative possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: journals → archival research → probe dive → nail retrieval → committee hearing → exoneration, with a legible before/after change. Closure is decisive and on-page—the ancestor’s status is officially reversed, and Elara’s stance reconfigures from dread to peace. However, several key beats (the dive, the committee deliberation) are summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens the felt cost. The convenience of the sonar match and the quick success of the presentation lower the sense of earned difficulty, even though structure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece reads as a single-scene, accumulative/textural design: present-tense contemplation at the pullout deepens into realization, then resolves in the act of playing the fiddle. Causality is soft but coherent—his observation of the scaffold wrap and glass flake leads to an interpretive leap about realms and his role as a bridge-song fiddler. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: before, he is confused and haunted; after, he accepts her vanishing as transition and claims his function, with a clear before/after. Stakes and turns stay modest, and the “secret” unravels without real friction, but there is a clean arc.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failed startup → return to the father’s hideout → encounter with squatter → use of markers to dissuade → departure with new stance. The single-scene structure on the train plus reflective backstory is easy to follow and the closure (he leaves on a “new path, unmarked and unknown”) is legible as a decisive reorientation with cost. That said, the pivotal encounter resolves quickly and somewhat smoothly, with little resistance or complication to test Leo’s resolve, which softens the impact of the climax. The thematic explanation in the final paragraph partially replaces dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure reads as accumulative/lyric: observatory work ↔ dreams ↔ realization ↔ application, with a clear conceptual turn when she understands the stars as emotional barometers and then as a “universal law.” Causality is sketched but soft—most transitions are stated (“she realized,” “when understanding dawned”) rather than dramatized as obstacles and choices. Closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is muted and almost entirely conceptual. There are no major orientation issues, but also no strong sense of narrowing options or irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: failed trick → frozen confession → search in expanding circles → seed ritual → confession released, curse eased. Orientation is solid from the outset (who/where/what she wants), and the story holds a consistent causal lens with an on-page Decisive Change: the curse loosens and Elara’s stance shifts. The cost is mild but present (the dangerous seed consumed, the centuries-long curse breaking with emotional weight), and there are no major teleports or rule breaches. Escalation is a bit linear and frictionless, yet closure is legible and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: curiosity and the clipping ritual → portal appears → covenant visions → choice to cross → covenant stirs and roots transform; nothing feels arbitrary. Structure is linear and focused in a single scene with escalation toward the portal crossing and covenant repricing, and closure is distinctly on the page. The “after the future arrived early” premise is intriguing but only lightly dramatized, mostly as background texture rather than an active structural constraint. Stakes and cost at the end could be sharpened by dramatizing more concrete risks or trade-offs in crossing rather than a relatively smooth transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene of ritual, confrontation with the keeper, and a closing reconfiguration where she changes her approach. Causality holds—her attempt to “rearrange symbols” prompts the keeper’s objection, which prompts her revised stance. Closure is present as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she relinquishes control and reframes the card as understanding rather than regret. The main limitation is the low external friction; nothing on the page truly tests the new stance beyond one conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: public failure → withdrawal to the trailer → Mara’s intervention → Leo’s reframed idea → a brief montage of new direction, ending in a charged final image. The drive lens reads as Causal, with a straightforward before/after change in Leo’s stance toward his past. Closure is solid—a decisive internal shift and new plan—but the transition from despair to solution feels somewhat easy, with little friction or setback once the idea appears. The brief summary of subsequent success blunts some immediacy and keeps the climax from fully landing in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: spirit’s departure → seed left behind → Elian’s attempt to use it → arbor’s response → visions → realization and reestablishment. Orientation is solid and the story holds to a single scene with a clear before/after state, landing a conceptual repricing of “transition.” The main weakness is the low sense of cost or risk around his goal; nothing pushes back or meaningfully threatens failure, so the closure lacks bite. Structurally sound but not yet gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural scene with a clear pattern: identities fluctuate, Elian smelts them, the cycle continues under altered understanding. Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Elian’s acceptance of the eternal now and his role crystallizes, but the cost of this stance remains abstract. Causality is simple but coherent—no orientation problems or broken links—though the middle third lapses into slight repetitiveness of the core beat (lift, smelt, return). Structural escalation is minimal, making the ending more of a cadence shift than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story is structurally clean: a single continuous scene, clear causal beats (inspection → shell → confessions → pearl → crowning → illumination → vow), and a solid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Closure is on the page, with a before/after in his outlook and a concrete new practice for his reports. The main limitation is the modest on-page cost; the shift reads more like a luminous realization than a pressured decision that forecloses options. Still, under an accumulative lens, the build from hush to radiance is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive at the station → search graffiti → encounter the key line → play the accordion → reconfigure her relationship to guilt. Causality is legible and situational pressure (her need for a sign) coherently drives the middle and end beats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets guilt and commits to integrating the past rather than erasing it. The main weakness is how conveniently the perfect graffiti phrase appears, which slightly reduces the felt difficulty of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: letter → search via cipher/propagation delays → approach reversals → threshold crisis → entry. The global drive reads as primarily causal with some accumulative patterning, and closure is clear when she finally passes into the library. However, the “second fateful letter” deadline never tightens on the page, so time pressure feels conceptual more than active. The final reversal at the threshold is resolved quickly and smoothly, softening the sense of hard-won arrival or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: tasked to authenticate the violin under a dawn deadline, she discovers its true power via coffee divination and then makes a morally charged decision whose effects (seeds awakening, violin melting, promise expiring) close the story. Closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses her imperial-aligned path and accepts a new, plant-bound purpose with real political and personal cost. Structure is a single coherent scene with one tightening turn (realizing the violin is a key) that carries through to the ending. The Empire’s response remains offstage, which slightly mutes the sense of immediate external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is linear, coherent, and easy to follow: preparation, ritual, success, and quiet denouement. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds gently through repeated attention to stillness and aurora, culminating in the chip’s successful infusion and her sense of completion. Closure does land—a resonant reconfiguration where the spark is now in the chip and her vigil is over—but there is little sense of alternative outcomes or cost beyond abstraction. The final paragraphs slightly over-explain her role and purpose rather than deepening the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and legible: caretaking → ritual scalloping → hairpin activation → realization → new resolution to guide others. As an accumulative/textural piece, it delivers a clear conceptual repricing at the end (contentment as active participation in rebirth), but the causal pressure between beats is gentle. Closure exists and is on-page, yet the cost of the before/after divide remains mostly abstract and retrospective. The brother’s betrayal frames the situation but never complicates current tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear and linear: request for guidance → ritual with chimes/mirror → transfer of cloak → reconfigured stance, with good causal linkage at each step. The drive lens reads as situational with accumulative/lyric shading; the pressure is the conversation itself, not an external deadline. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s options are reweighted from binary to gradient, with Aris departing and the shard/cloak reset for the next client. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is coherent: a single trance lesson that deepens toward a conceptual realization, with each step (platform → trance → intensifying magnetism → dissolution → insight) linked logically. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael reinterprets vanishing/appearing and Elara’s reverse aging, providing a clear before/after in understanding, though the cost is mostly abstract. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the accumulative drive lens is consistent. The ending does not surprise but it does satisfy structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: find artifact → read birds → test echo → harmonize pulse → attain new mode of navigation. Causality broadly holds, though many links are asserted in mystical language rather than dramatized as risky or uncertain steps. Closure is on-page and legible—Elara integrates the arrowhead and reconfigures her relationship to movement and the canyon—but the cost of success is not clearly articulated. The scene is essentially one smooth ascent without meaningful jeopardy or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causality is clean: keystone discovery → realization of its power → decision to augment mist walking → arrival in the garden → transformation of the spire and Elian’s new purpose. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and closure is present via Elian’s transformation and the spire’s reconfiguration. However, crucial middle beats are summarized (“the journey was treacherous”) instead of dramatized, so escalation feels conceptually sketched rather than experienced. Cost at closure is modest and mostly implied (he abandons his old way of being) rather than concretely tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: key tag → pull toward wreck → dive → library → key fits → orb reveals color of sound → return changed. Structure is linear, with no orientation issues and a clear closure beat where his purpose broadens. The weakness is in the frictionless progression—obstacles are minimal and every setup pays off predictably, so the inciting discovery and climax lack real jeopardy or hard choice. Closure exists, but the lack of resistance and visible price keeps it from feeling fully earned at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: repeated casts, static-bursts, and prophecy reflection build toward the realization that contraction is transformation. Causality is soft but legible—coins → unusual sequence → archives → intensified static → conceptual shift—and there is on-page closure via a conceptual repricing of the universe’s “end.” However, escalation is mostly told and thematic rather than dramatized, and the cost of the shift remains low and abstract. The piece reads more like a polished vignette than a fully pressurized narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene ritual arc: he comes to the observatory with a goal, performs a concrete process, and emerges in a reconfigured state. Causality is coherent (finds recordings → comes here → uses prisms and atlas → crystallizes echo → reinterprets her sacrifice), and the closure—leaving the crystallized echo behind while carrying clarified love—is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration. Stakes stay mostly internal and contemplative, but there is a clear before/after in how he bears his grief. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Elian comes to the viaduct to repair the bell so it can restore the river, and that goal is cleanly achieved on the page. The piece maintains a single scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and the closure (bell rings, river revives) is decisive and easy to follow. However, the path from start to success is almost frictionless, with only a minor cut and fatigue as obstacles; the ritual never truly feels in doubt. The cost of success is thus modest, which keeps the structure competent but not compelling at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: resurfacing → discovery of photographs → recovered memory → decision to tell stories → communal memorialization, yielding a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is strong from the outset (who he is, where he walks, what resurfacing means). The closure—his shift from guarding water to guarding heritage—lands on the page with a legible before/after, though the price feels largely pre-paid offstage. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent, but pressure remains gentle throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation and throughline are excellent: one scene, one POV, causal enough within an accumulative/lyric frame. The piece does deliver a before/after—she arrives divided and leaves internally unified and ready for the Great Work—but the path feels almost preordained, with minimal friction en route. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the cost of the change is only lightly implied, so the transformation lands more as confirmation than earned revaluation. Structurally, there are no glaring missteps, only a softness in how hard-won the resolution feels.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous data after static → need to revise protocols → inventive hybrid analysis → reinterpreted as celestial event → reconfigured relationship to burden. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Stakes and situation are oriented early (who/where/what she does), so there’s no orientation debt. The main limitation is that the “near-catastrophe” and world-saving implications are gestured at rather than dramatized, which keeps the cost light.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: ego-death survivor in a rewriting-history dojo → cloned brain’s custody dispute → Kael’s attribute and personal tie make him central → he proposes merging/vivifying → ritual stabilizes history and self. Closure is solid, with a decisive change in both Kael and the world. Yet the custody “battle” is mostly summarized argument, the factions concede with almost no resistance, and the ritual succeeds on the first try without visible risk or cost beyond a quick emotional flood. The result is structurally sound but feels somewhat easy for the scale of stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is legible: the mysterious seed provokes reflection, which recalls the corporate threat, which in turn leads to the decision to make a new room. Structure is straightforward and linear with one reflective shard (the buyout attempt) justified by the present moment at the brook. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the seed shifts from ominous object to cornerstone of her creative defense. The missing piece is an on-page cost or genuine narrowing of options—nothing forces her hand beyond contemplation, so the climax reads more like a gentle design brainstorm than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: hourglass empties → Conductor initiates ritual → sound builds → sorrow macerates → laughter returns → he departs. Causality is coherent even in a lyric mode—pulling cords, adjusting blowers, and intensifying song lead to the giggle and then full laughter. Closure is strong, with a resonant reconfiguration: laughter comes back changed, and the world’s rules are subtly repriced (“time had not stopped; it had simply changed key”). The main limitation is that the middle can feel texturally static—more variations in pressure or obstacles inside the ritual itself would sharpen the structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure reads as accumulative/lyric: cycles of waiting and reflection build toward the pendant’s activation and the final metaphysical shift. Causality is soft but coherent—pendant hums, realization of “key,” choice of the between, transformation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: home redefined as uncertainty, with the cost of abandoning a concrete, yearned-for library. The pattern is clean and legible, though the middle risks feeling slightly static before the pendant’s turn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal line: arrive at the nexus → prepare ritual → hesitate → realize fear is the obstacle → choose full destruction → rebirth of the crozier. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the closure—Elian leaving with a vivified staff and new self-concept—is clearly a Decisive Change. Cost is mostly emotional and anticipatory rather than materially felt, but it is legible in his risk of “irreversible loss.” Some repetition of thematic explanation slightly dulls structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with a clear goal (find the signal), one turn (seek the gap instead of the noise), and a conceptual-repricing closure. Causality is coherent—her choice to change tactics leads to the signal—and there are no orientation issues. The closure is more intellectual than costly; nothing she values is truly threatened or lost, which keeps the decisive change from fully landing at an elite level. Still, the before/after in understanding is legible and earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible and coherent: Eli in the grotto → experiments with radio → contact with other Elis → recognition of patterns via the hourglass → alignment → ferry’s return. Closure is undeniable and on-page (the Sea-Sprite rematerializes), so the piece satisfies a decisive change under a causal drive lens. The main weakness is cost: the resolution arrives smoothly once the method is understood, with no real setback, trade-off, or credible risk of failure dramatized, which keeps the structure from feeling fully earned at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure reads as accumulative/textural: the weaving, memory shifts, and illusions build toward a conceptual repricing where the gallery is revealed as her mind and she accepts authorship of her reality. Causality is soft but coherent—her weaving triggers the eruption, which she then guides into a new illusion and understanding. Closure is present but low-cost: reality reconfigures, yet no option is clearly foreclosed and no sacrifice is made. The piece maintains orientation (who/where/what) and holds its lens through to the end, but the stakes stay abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a classroom lesson that crescendos into a quiet solo reflection—reads cleanly with a coherent before/after: from teaching a technique to reframing navigation as existential stance. Causality is straightforward (lesson → student engagement → reflective reweighting), and the drive lens feels mostly accumulative/textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the ocean shifts from prison to launchpad, tied to the established motifs. Stakes are modest and philosophical rather than sharply dramatized, but they hold together without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: pulses → atrium → bench → contact → release. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a coherent closure beat (Eleanor’s peaceful fading and Elara’s reaffirmed role). However, the story lacks obstacles or complications; every step works on first try, which flattens the dramatic curve. The cost at closure is mild, more atmospheric than structurally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal drive is clean: enter facility → follow codex → reach core → return before tide shift, with no major logical breaks. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: she restores the codex, witnesses the researchers’ ghosts, and escapes with a reweighted sense of self and purpose. However, the tidal-stakes clock is more declared than dramatized; the escape is smooth and lacks a concrete near-failure or forced tactical adjustment. Structure is sound and readable but could use one sharper, costed turn near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single, anchored scene in the observatory with one embedded flashback sequence mediated by the ink. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative lens: she performs the defragmentation, re-experiences the catastrophe in ordered form, and that process yields the closing stance shift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she stops counting beats, reinterprets the shard, and redefines the observatory as sanctuary—with an on-page emotional cost in facing her agency in Kael’s death. The one weakness is that success in the ritual feels assured from the outset, so structural tension is more inevitability than uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: canyon → birds → revealed tunnel → cursed diamond → failed attempt → revised tactic. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with clear causal links. Closure lands as a charged poise when she chooses to harmonize with the curse, but the outcome of that choice—and its concrete cost—remains off-page, softening the sense of decisive after. Tightening the ending so that her new tactic visibly reconfigures options or exacts a price would strengthen the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: Aris comes with a goal and tools, performs a ritual-like action, and the garden plus the changed people transform in response, yielding a clear before/after. Causality is broadly sound (arrowhead placement → gravitational reaction → confessions → laughter → metamorphosis), and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with accumulative lyric touches. Closure is present—his mission is fulfilled, the garden is reborn—but the absence of any real setback or resistance makes the arc feel somewhat preordained. The cost is implied more conceptually than dramatized in a specific, felt moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara descends, confronts the Warden and crystal, uses heartbeat music to free the statues, and the orchard transforms, providing a legible before/after. However, the structure is almost entirely linear and frictionless, with no meaningful obstacle once the method is introduced. Closure is present but low-cost; the decisive change feels somewhat pre-ordained rather than hard-won. Still, orientation is solid and the story respects its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal structure: Elian waits, the drone arrives, he loads the bottle, it departs, and he reflects. Orientation is strong and closure lands as a quiet earned stasis/charged poise—he has taken another small illegal step in service of his quest. But there is almost no complication or turn: nothing interferes with the plan, and the danger remains entirely hypothetical, so the before/after change is conceptually meaningful but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean, causal throughline: wrong turn → discovery of the train → discovery of the halo fragment → restoration work → song that reanimates the space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the site shifts from “tomb of memories” to “cradle of potential,” with the halo’s steady light as a final image. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with pressure built via atmosphere and labor rather than overt obstacles, but the pivot into song is a clear structural beat. The main limitation is that the cost at closure remains gentle and implicit rather than sharply articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain—mapping hyperbolic geometry, activating the scarf’s memories, opening the doorway, stepping through, and returning reconfigured—is clean and legible. Orientation (who/where/when and what she wants) is firmly established early, and the piece holds a single coherent scene with a brief interior expansion in the realm of stories. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she finds the realm, sacrifices the scarf, and her solitude is redefined. The main limitation is that the price of success remains thematically rather than structurally heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: one continuous nocturnal setup leading to the sunrise attempt, the revelation, and a quiet but definite resolution. Causality is clean—preparation leads to the photographic/painting act, which forces the dream into visibility and triggers the memory recognition. Closure is on-page (she understands the dream as her mother and releases it, with the palette spent), with a legible before/after. Some mid-story beats feel slightly redundant (“she painted vigorously,” “she persisted”), which softens the sense of tightening, but doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward: hint from the star → archway → using the lock of hair → disorienting defense → freeing the idea → aftermath, so the structure is coherent and closure (the idea’s release) lands. The drive lens reads as largely Accumulative/Textural with a light causal spine, and that spine holds. However, the stakes and costs stay mostly abstract—“forgotten truths,” “fear,” “cosmic possibility”—so the final victory feels conceptually tidy rather than hard-won. The guardians of fear are gestured at as pressure but never substantively dramatized, softening the climax’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: she returns to the site, studies broken constellations, manipulates the mushrooms, and thereby unlocks the memory and partially heals the land. Closure lands cleanly via a decisive act (realigning the final mushroom) and a resonant reconfiguration (memories and environment both shift). Some of the fairy “encryption” mechanics are explained rather than dramatized, and there’s no real uncertainty about success once the method appears, which flattens the peak a bit. Still, the piece fulfills a compact, one-arc structure without gaps or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous teaching scene where each step (leaves → shard → annotation) causally advances Elian toward reversal of exile. The closure—him seeing the path home and leaving as the swing falls silent while she walks forward—is legible and earned as a Decisive Change with a small Resonant Reconfiguration for her. Stakes and cost are modest, and the success comes a touch easily, but nothing breaks causality. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early and the drive lens (causal mentoring) stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: she senses decay, weaves between worlds, captures essence, plants the seed, the orchard revives. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, but the piece still gestures at causal stakes (orchard dying) that never seriously endanger the plan. Closure exists—orchard restored and her work continues—but the outcome is never in doubt and no beat seriously complicates or redirects the process. The absence of a meaningful obstacle or price at the climax keeps it below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous scene, clear anchors, and a straightforward progression from preparation to completion of the net-unraveling ritual. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each knot unraveled deepens the silence and draws us toward release. Closure is present via a resonant reconfiguration—the spirits are grounded, Elara’s unrest lifts, and the sanctuary’s atmosphere changes. The main weakness is the light sense of cost: the danger is gestured at but never materially tests or threatens their options, making the climax feel somewhat low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: map tear and legend → comparison of footage → discovery of altered shadows and fissure → deliberate opening → chapel + whole map realization. Structure is linear and legible with no orientation issues, and closure lands as a decisive change plus internal reconfiguration. The main weakness is that the stakes and cost of this causal progression stay modest and mostly conceptual; nothing seriously threatens her or her goal. Still, under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens, it functions solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: descent to the SS Veritas, discovery of the snow globe and logs, thematic realization, then ascent with a new stance—closure is present and legible. Causality is broadly solid (globe → transmission → note → realization), but the story leans heavily on exposition rather than on dramatized beats where options narrow under pressure. The “library of relinquishment” reveal works conceptually but arrives as a summary assertion, reducing the sense of concrete progression. Overall, it’s coherent and complete, but feels more like an elegant parable than a scene with tight structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is simple and coherent: she prepares, performs the encode ritual, the ghost manifests, and the messages go out—delivering a clean Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated storm and machinery motifs do build toward the apparition and final bridge between souls. However, there is almost no meaningful complication, reversal, or narrowing of options; everything unfolds in a straight, untroubled line. The lack of visible cost at closure keeps the arc from feeling fully consequential despite its clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ascent with the diary decoding as the organizing spine, and the ending provides a conceptual before/after shift. Causality is simple but coherent—she finds the book, uses the goggles, and her understanding changes as they rise. However, escalation is mostly linear accumulation without a true hinge beat where options or stakes materially shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost and narrowing of paths remain soft.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: he catalogs clouds, deepens his understanding, and arrives at a conceptual repricing—the sky as a “library of emotions” and emptiness as a “keeper of stories.” Causality is simple but coherent; the piece does not violate its own logic. Closure is present but low-cost: he shifts from fear of oblivion to serene belief, without a felt sacrifice or irreversible choice. The beat sequence is somewhat repetitive, with each new cloud adding texture rather than a distinct structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: hunt for knowledge → discovery of the safe → unlocking with the coin → access to lenses/scroll → creation of the mural → realization of its limitation as demolition begins. Orientation is strong from the first line; we always know who, where, and when we are. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she re-evaluates the entire project once she sees that captured sky is finite and false. The cost—accepting the loss of both library and mural without achieving her original goal—is legible and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: she notices the luminance, records and decodes it via hopscotch/phrasebook, confirms a hidden current, and the captain changes course, delivering a clear Decisive Change. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when and what she wants are all legible), and the story maintains a straightforward throughline. The closure lands, but the cost is minimal—success comes on the first try with no significant setback, doubt, or contradiction, so the before/after is conceptually solid but emotionally light. The drive lens reads as Causal throughout and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: longing → journey to the frozen library → discovery of prophecies → geared vial in the mirror hall → uncapping and revelation; closure as a conceptual repricing is legible. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine, and the ending clearly reconfigures her understanding of repair and time. However, escalation is more procedural than pressured—obstacles (searching shelves, working the vial) never seriously threaten failure, and cost at closure is mainly conceptual. Structure is elegant and self-contained but a bit low-tension for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: chalk message → bell discovery → resonance work → doubt → renewed commitment → nebula’s awakening and the ghost’s exit. Orientation is excellent and the structure (problem, attempt, faltering faith, renewed effort, payoff) is classical without seams. Closure lands clearly: the world and their prospects change, and the ghost’s departure plus the family’s new stasis function as a decisive before/after. The main limitation is that the plan’s success feels almost inevitable once explained, with little on-page sense that failure remains a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, linear ascent to the lantern room, calibration, lullaby, and dissolution, with no orientation issues and a coherent accumulative drive. Causality is simple but legible—she uses the puppet head to unlock the lullaby, sings, and the universe receives peace as the clock hits midnight. Closure is solidly on the page (her life-force expenditure and the lighthouse fading), with a clear before/after. However, the path is almost frictionless; there’s minimal complication or structural surprise beyond steady escalation in lyric intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: cries → remembered blueprint → device assembly → guided escape before frost, with no major logic gaps. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and maintained, and the single-scene structure holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: same role, but reweighted from burden to accepted guardianship, with the persistent constraint of the orchard intact. A touch more complication or a sharper midpoint turn could lift structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: ravine scene → insight → lab application → project launch, all linked by clear because/therefore causality under a Causal/Accumulative lens. Closure is solid: he redefines atonement and commits to a concrete new path with cost (living with memory instead of self-erasure). The temporal shift (“Back in his lab, days later”) is legible and the global drive (guilt transformed into action) holds. What keeps it below elite level is that much of the middle/lab material is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: introduction of the lull and motivation, experiment with moonlight, traversal into the nascent-story realm, conceptual revaluation on return, and a charged new role at the end. Causality is clear enough—her desire leads to the moonlight experiment, which opens the doorway, which reconfigures her stance toward the shop—and closure is a neat conceptual repricing of “erasure” into “beginnings.” However, the path is almost frictionless: nothing meaningfully resists or complicates her project, so the decisive change lacks on-page struggle. The final beats reiterate earlier insights rather than adding a sharper final turn, which softens the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and legible: arrival, descent into the pavilion, immersion and work, then a softened aftermath. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density of remorse imagery and repeated motifs do build toward a closure where the pavilion’s burden is transformed and partially released. However, escalation is gentle and there’s no strong mid-story turn that significantly narrows options or makes failure feel possible. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost remains relatively abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: broken clock → fractured villages → Elara’s plan → joint repair → renewed chiming and symbolic reunification. Structure is straightforward and well-contained in a single escalating scene, with backstory efficiently front-loaded and then enacted. Closure is on-page and legible, but the repair and reconciliation unfold almost frictionlessly; no major setback, reversal, or refusal complicates the throughline. As a result, the ending is satisfying but a bit too easy for a piece aiming at elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is a single continuous ritual scene that accumulates intensity as she works with the mirror, accesses progressively weightier memories, and reaches a dawn-anchored closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: each beat adds another layer of memory and self-rewiring, culminating in her claimed new identity. Causality is fairly straightforward (she adjusts the mirror → accesses memories → rewires herself), but the turns are soft and largely experiential rather than decisively narrowing options. Closure is present and legible, yet the cost of that shift remains more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline—wait for gravity inversion, enter grotto, navigate thresholds using the glowing map, reach vault, gain knowledge—is coherent and clean. The story maintains a single scene with rising complication (shifting environment, intensifying threshold effects) and lands a clear closure beat when she acquires the combinations and her role shifts to guardian. Cost at the ending is mostly conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than dramatized as a painful choice, which keeps the resolution a bit soft. Still, the drive lens holds and there is a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: long silence → discovery of the embedded sculpture → interpretation of its cracks → building and playing the instrument → the grove’s reawakening. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and the closure—silence giving way to music—is legible and satisfying. What’s missing is a credible on-page cost or meaningful risk to Elara if she fails. Structure is elegant and coherent, but a bit frictionless for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece holds a clean single scene with interleaved backstory and a coherent causal line: Kael comes to the nexus, reflects on the covenant’s fall, then uses the stone to partially restore it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the eclipsed covenant “breathes again,” reweighting his exile and purpose. The drive lens is primarily causal, though the “translating silence” mechanics remain somewhat abstract and conveniently effective. Cost at the end is more conceptual than concretely dramatized, which limits impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward: one continuous scene of retrieval framed by a soft time pressure (fireworks approaching) and anchored by a clear before/after (locked vs. unlocked diary, less vs. more mature empathy). Causality is functional but light—she activates the device, adjusts frequencies, the clasp clicks, she reads, she reflects—with no real obstacles or reversals. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing: the “silence of fulfillment” and reframing of empathy as listening. The lack of a tangible cost or genuine threat to failure keeps the arc from feeling decisively shaped by events.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous evening that moves from reflection on failure to sensory discovery to conceptual reorientation and the seed’s crack as closure. Causality operates coherently—new scent → investigation → recognition of activation → reframed understanding—under a primarily accumulative/lyric lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward cultivation and wisdom shifts in a way that clearly distinguishes “before” from “after.” Stakes remain small-scale and internal, but for this length and design, the arc feels contained and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: gravity inverts → he follows the water → finds the arrow tip → reaches the cavern → receives the revelation → departs as the inversion ends. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the piece maintains a single, coherent drive toward discovery. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: he now understands the orchards’ resilience as echo-tech and commits to documenting it. The main limitation is that each step unfolds with minimal resistance or complication, so the structure reads more like an elegant tour than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is clear: survey the labyrinth, encounter the patch, integrate wind data, arrive at the crash site, and reframe the disaster into preventative knowledge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with a new, charged understanding and a concrete token (the patch) embodying the cost. The drive lens stays essentially causal with an accumulative texture—each observation feeds his reconstruction. Stakes skew conceptual rather than situationally urgent, which keeps the structure intelligent but somewhat cool.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story is structurally coherent: anticipation → preparation → aurora alignment → chime → release, with a legible before/after in the amber sheet and the cavern. The inferred drive lens is largely accumulative/textural with a light causal spine, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (the hush returning changed). However, the decisive moment unfolds without real complication or setback, so while closure is present, it lacks felt cost. The synchronous sculptor beat adds conceptual symmetry but not real structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: failure → pilgrimage to the thunder-echo range → preparation (markers) → traversal between worlds → confrontation with past errors → return with reconfigured stance. Structure is linear with one major excursion and an unambiguous closure unit where his relationship to failure and the setting shifts. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/emotional; there’s no serious doubt he’ll succeed, which mutes peak pressure. Still, the scene’s scaffolding (driftwood, flute, otherworldly revisitations) is coherent and pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: successive runs of the press, escalating empathy transpositions, and the eventual inversion (her essence into the halo) build logically. Orientation is strong early—who/where/when are legible—and the pattern of repetition-with-intensification is easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her entire project: she reframes where the “mathematics” lie and alters her behavior by putting the fragment away. The cost—recognizing limits and giving up the dangerous experiment—is clear enough for this length, though it remains mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter on the ridgeway that incrementally reframes Kaelen’s role, culminating in his redefined sense of purpose. Causality is simple but coherent—pendant hums → encounter stretches → traveler explains → Kaelen repurposes his work—and orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the outset. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of his courier job and the night’s memory into myth, with a legible before/after. The cost of this reconfiguration is mostly implied (abandoning a purely transactional view of his work), which keeps the impact modest rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear because/therefore chain from approaching the arbor to using the prism to the self-implicating revelation. Orientation is solid early, and the global drive (to prove her theory) is reweighted at closure when it exposes her own emotions. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: objects absorbing emotion is no longer just a mystical principle but a personal indictment. The escalation is modest and reflective rather than sharply pressured, so while satisfying, it lacks the punch of truly top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: puzzle edges → loom-bridge → advancing raveling silence → bead-insertion → sacrifice → Liam’s release and orchard renewal. The story maintains one dominant drive and lands a clear Decisive Change with visible cost. Some beats echo one another (silence advancing, her draining) without adding new tactical constraints, slightly flattening mid-section dynamics. Still, orientation is solid and closure is legible and earned under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clean: mining → discovery of silk → barter with mage → secret for metal → forging → teaching others → societal renewal, with a clear before/after and a resonant, if quiet, closure. However, most major beats are summarized rather than staged, so turns register intellectually more than viscerally, and the “cost” of the barter is asserted rather than dramatized. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with an accumulative, mythic overlay, and that holds through the ending. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (Elian’s role and the planet’s renewal), but the lack of on-page struggle limits its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → reality shift → deliberate weaving → rift → revelation → release of shard. Closure is present as a conceptual reconfiguration once he learns about his mother’s sacrifice and walks away changed. However, the structure feels a bit outlined and convenient: the shard instantly grants exactly the world-bending functionality he needs, and the rift opens without much complication or setback. The lack of meaningful resistance or reversal on the way to the climax keeps this from top-tier structural sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: lamp fails → island dark → letters reveal threat and plea → Elian chooses cairn and relighting → haunting calms, channel protected. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains stable, and the drive lens reads clearly causal throughout. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid: the light is restored and the haunting reconfigured, with a tangible before/after in the tower’s presence. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than materially perilous, which restrains the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative, lyric scene: we move up the tower, prepare the light, and end in a charged poise with the world “poised on the edge of something new.” Causality is simple but coherent—he readies and steers the beam as the storm gathers. However, there is no strong structural turn; the “visions” and increased energy largely restate the initial premise rather than reconfiguring options with cost. Closure lands conceptually, but with limited escalation or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual that moves from preparation (tea house, wing, sun trails) to vision (symbols, story-magnets) to realization (his own place in the web). Causality is intact: tracking sun trails through the wing leads to the illumination of symbols, which leads to his conceptual shift. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: he reinterprets his heart and identity as a story-magnet, with the wing’s disintegration marking the before/after. The main limitation is that stakes and cost stay abstract, so the change matters conceptually more than it feels pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is linear and legible: ascent, preparation, catalytic sound, ritual with dreams and sextant, and a conceptual shift at the end, fitting an accumulative/textural drive. Causal links exist but are soft—the “pin” sound as a trigger for the tower’s magic and the smooth success of her method feel convenient rather than pressured. Closure does land via a conceptual repricing of her sorrow and the trees’ role, but the cost is light and largely declared rather than dramatized. Overall, it’s well-shaped but not yet at the knife-edge precision of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: dying world → need for woven dawns via mica window and songs → repeated attempts → brink → successful song that restores light and community. Closure is decisive and legible, with a clear before/after in both the realm and Elara. However, the escalation is somewhat compressed: the “profound stillness” and one successful ritual resolve world-scale stakes without any failed attempt or surprise turn. Structure is coherent and single-scene, but the ease of the final victory softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain (invitation → library → ritual → sharing → reading → inner shift) is clean and easy to follow, and there is a clear before/after reconfiguration when she leaves with a renewed sense of purpose. Closure is present—she conceptually reprices her mistake and repositions herself in relation to solitude and connection. However, key beats (the past betrayal, the ritual itself, the reading of histories) are summarized rather than dramatized, dulling impact. The cost of change is implied rather than made sharply legible in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: seasonal absence → sanctuary routine → discovery of the compartment → journal revelation → reweighted final image. Causality is plausible and legible, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where her work reframes both the past gardener’s shame and her own—is clearly on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds from start to finish. The main limitation is that the structural turn, while apt, is modest in scope and doesn’t sharply constrict options or escalate consequences beyond the internal.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Elian sets up the projector, samples the vows, the lantern dims, and he races to finish before they fade, ending with an earned stasis/closure as data outlives magic. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the outset, and the single continuous scene reads coherently. The main weakness is that the narrative pressure line is flat; each step feels like a predictable extension of the premise rather than a meaningful turn until the very late “quickening” as the slide dims. Still, the closure image of completed records vs vanished light provides a legible before/after reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s false exits → Silas’s sense of safety → the overheard negotiation → the rupture she wants to capture; the drive lens reads as causal with some accumulative texture. The scene is continuous and well-oriented with a clear location, time constraint, and single POV, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with the “sound” sealed in the fob and Silas undone by his greed. Cost is present but somewhat muted: her family’s route is presumably safe and Silas gets punished, so her victory is only lightly shaded by “sorrowful peace” rather than a sharp price. The piece avoids major causality breaks but could sharpen the sense that she has genuinely foreclosed or endangered a path rather than winning cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal spine—ring detects anomaly → descent into valley → encounter with weather-carrier → conceptual explanation → internal resolution—is clean and easy to follow, with a coherent single-scene structure. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing: Elara’s understanding of weather-carriers and herself reconfigures the situation, and the final forest “hum” plus the ring going still provides a closing cadence. However, the central answer arrives via a relatively undramatized lecture, so the climax feels low-pressure and somewhat preordained, with minimal complication or setback on the way. Structural promise around the elections and “fate of the wooded realms” hints at higher stakes than the plot actually uses, creating mild underutilization rather than a structural break.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: public mockery → flight → remembered cave → discovered painting/compartment → combination epiphany → breakthrough sketch. Closure is on the page with a clear before/after (blocked vs. uncorked), and the lingering sorrow gives it some cost. However, the mentor’s perfectly preserved gift and the instant functional usefulness of the note/charcoal read conveniently, softening the struggle. The drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds, but the solution arrives with little real resistance once she finds the niche.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: hidden map → deciphered route → journey through city → archive activation → discovery and reframing of her quest. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, with a clear before/after once she learns lost conversations are stored in the archive. However, nearly all turns arrive without resistance—no serious complication ever threatens to derail the goal—which keeps the closure from feeling hard-won. The ending counts as a conceptual repricing with modest cost rather than a decisive change under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: problem (wonder fading) → preparation (tuning, kinetic sculpture) → climax (grand symphony) → aftermath, with no orientation issues. Closure is present and legible: the symphony restores the color of wonder, and the final cadence is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing of her ongoing role. However, the path from recognition of the problem to success is frictionless—no real setbacks, alternate strategies, or costs complicate the causal chain. The drive reads as mostly accumulative/textural rather than sharply causal, which softens impact at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic shift worsens static → memory of the box → miniaturization of fears → controlled burn → breach and escape, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael exits, the static is quieted, and the dome/farm are recontextualized as past. Cost is present but somewhat soft—one sector burns and he carries the condensed fears, yet the narrative assures the farm will regrow. Structurally, the piece stays coherent and focused, but the plan’s execution is almost frictionless, limiting dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and coherent: locket dropped → Elara investigates via neighbors → learns about Mr. Hemlock and the mailbox → offers locket and key → letter is read. The single-POV, linear structure fits the length, and the mailbox opening provides a clear decisive change and resolution. However, escalation is somewhat smooth and obstacle-light; each step yields information or consent without serious resistance or complication. Still, closure lands on the page with a recognizable before/after, especially in Mr. Hemlock’s stance toward his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Structure is linear and coherent: enter lab → decode journals → awaken systems → free subjects, with a clear before/after. Causality broadly holds, but there are no meaningful setbacks or complications; each step succeeds as soon as it’s attempted. Closure is technically present (systems awaken, door opens, prisoners are freed, inner realization lands) but feels low-cost and inevitable. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/lyric with light causal scaffolding, yet escalation within that frame is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the whale’s beaching → gravity anomalies → heightened unease → coffee-ground divination → salt chamber → jar and letters → conceptual shift about memory. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and firm, and the structure (dock → journey → cavern → return) supports a clear before/after arc with a visible emotional price. The closure—her repricing of “deleted memories” and her ritual with the lanterns and flowers—lands on the page and reads like an earned reconfiguration rather than a simple plot stop. The main weakness is how easily each step unlocks the next (the coffee grounds produce an almost mechanical map, obstacles in the cavern never truly threaten failure), which keeps the structural pressure from feeling fully rigorous at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: he arrives, performs a ritual, and succeeds, which provides basic closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated refrains (smoothed hush, terrestrially cosmic balance) build toward a quiet conclusion, but the pattern never tightens into a true sense of jeopardy. The prophecy is framed as dire, yet nothing on the page suggests real risk of failure or complication, so the climax feels inevitable rather than hard-won. Closure exists (the prophecy is silenced), but it lacks a discernible price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: inciting contact via the sugar pretext, a developing ritual of weekly teas, and a culminating rooftop scene where she questions his purpose and he passes on the seal before dissolving. Causality is coherent but relatively soft; events mostly accrue in a lyrical, reflective way rather than through strong because/therefore turns. Closure is solid as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the mentor’s departure redefines her relationship to the city’s “language” and leaves a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the central “lesson” progresses more as explanation than as dramatized trial or change in her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: she comes to the garden to archive a quarantined memory, activates the shell and stones, relives the loss, and completes the ritual, resulting in a clear before/after. The drive lens is primarily causal with an internal focus, and the closure—she has archived the memory and reframed her life—is legible and on-page. The cost (re-experiencing her mother’s disappearance) is present but quickly processed, with little resistance or complication once the ritual begins. Structurally the piece is solid but predictable, with no meaningful surprise or destabilizing turn beyond the expected catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and causal: years of guilt → journey to sanctuary → ritual with the thorn → emotional release and departure. Closure lands on the page through a decisive act (pressing and drawing the thorn, “the action to unlink was complete”) and an afterward state of peace, with a clear before/after. The drive lens is predominantly causal with reflective texture, and it holds steadily; there are no orientation issues. The main limitation is a lack of complication or reversal in the middle—events progress in a nearly foregone, ritualistic line.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens, moving through layers of revelation toward a conceptual closure where the rules of echoing are explained and reweighted. Causality is broadly coherent—Kaelen listens, learns, sings, and thereby exposes/manages the false echoes—but most turns are summarized rather than dramatized, giving events an outline-like feel. Closure is present (a clear before/after in his understanding and status as an echo), but the cost is mostly abstract and reflective rather than concretely staged. The structure is intelligible and complete but too expository to feel dynamically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal throughline is clean: shrine → dream-gathering → revelation about the snow globe → visit to Anya → spiritual resolution, with a clear before/after in Elias’s unrest and Anya’s grief. The drive lens is Causal and holds without contradiction, and closure is on the page with conceptual and emotional cost (a lifetime of not knowing reweighted by a painful solace). However, nearly all major turns (discovering the dreams, decoding the snow globe’s meaning) are summarized rather than scened, which flattens tension. There are no major causality breaks, but the structural feel is outline-like rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly bifurcated between parapet and hut, with an accumulative/textural drive and a clear conceptual closure: he returns home with a reweighted sense of his work. Causality is simple but coherent—parapet experience → insight → applied to nets—with no orientation issues. However, the closure lacks a strong sense of cost or constrained alternative; his “before” and “after” are gently contrasted rather than decisively altered. The result feels polished but low-pressure, more like an extended meditation than a story under real narrative stress.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → search → box of confetti → reassembled letters → deduction of the orchard as stillpoint → digging → activation of the diamond → realization of the liquidation’s true nature and the sacrifice cost. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear tightening as he moves from abstract rumor to concrete object. Closure lands as a charged poise: the world and its history have been reinterpreted, and he now faces a live decision with stakes and cost. The main weakness is that the revelation about the liquidation and the sacrifice feels slightly expository and compressed into summary rather than being more fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clear: long vigil → catalytic broadcast → descent → alliance with prophet → use of radio knowledge to unify factions → reconciliatory dawn. The structure tends toward summary in the midsection (rise of the prophet, council conflicts, betrayals) rather than fully dramatized beats, which flattens some potential turns. Closure is solid: Elara has moved from isolated observer to engaged, liminal guide, with the observatory reconfigured as memory and symbol. The cost—abandoning the safety of solitude for partial, uneasy belonging—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal and linear: wake → prepare → wind box → capture phrases → arrange jars → depart with a reconfigured sense of self. As an accumulative/textural piece, it steadily layers variations on his craft toward the closure image of him as “keeper, a bridge across time.” Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration of his role and self-concept with felt cost in his solitary, self-imposed task. Still, the middle risks a sense of gentle sameness; no major turn or on-page complication significantly tightens his options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain—ice destabilizing the mechanism, Kaelen crossing the ice, activating sonic absolution, near-misalignment, and stabilization—is clear and coherent. Closure is present: the marina is safe, the key intact, and his purpose reaffirmed, with a legible before/after. However, escalation is smooth rather than taut; each obstacle yields promptly to the next intended tactic without substantial complication. The structure is straightforward single-scene progression, effective but not especially surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: preparation at the viaduct, timed to the mapped moon paths, culminates in the community’s collective “unyoking.” As an accumulative/textural design, it builds ritual pressure toward a clear closure beat where their way of life changes. Causality is soft but legible (moon convergence → signal → communal act), and orientation in space/time is strong. The main limitation is that no beat meaningfully threatens or alters the plan, so the path from setup to payoff feels very smooth and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation → discovery of negligence → hidden ledger → confrontation with Thorn → choice to defy him → later reforms. Closure is decisive and legible, with the ledger and her refusal functioning as the hinge. The brief epilogue summarizing reforms feels somewhat easy and expository, softening tension that could have remained charged. Thorn’s attempt to seize the ledger resolves quickly and without much complication, keeping the structural arc solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: chaplain’s guilt → second opinion → training → repair → internal reconfiguration, all anchored in one main setting with a brief, legible time skip. The global drive reads as primarily causal with a strong accumulative texture, and the ending offers a clear resonant reconfiguration as the repaired heart and renewed purpose align. Closure has on-page cost—time, effort, confrontation with regret—even if the external obstacles remain modest. Structure is tight and coherent, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: curiosity → decoding via arrow/kaleidoscope → feeding the sequence back → bell rings and algorithm falls silent. The global drive reads as mostly causal with a conceptual repricing at the end (the unheard bell as seed for future change), and there is a legible before/after: an eternally yearning machine versus one whose purpose is fulfilled. Cost is more conceptual than felt, but the closure still lands. Structure is straightforward single-scene and coherent, with no orientation problems or broken set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causality is clean: obsession → cold case → numbers → patch → hidden cluster → messages → realization of sabotage → conceptual revaluation of “deleted files.” The piece lands a valid closure via conceptual repricing, with a clear before/after in how Elara understands deletion and memory. However, several key beats (the corporate cover-up, the sabotage) arrive largely as told revelations rather than dramatized turns, which blunts impact. The investigation’s obstacles are minimal and resolved quickly, limiting structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → failing lighthouse/orb memory → trip to Driftwood → mirror method → orb restoration → leviathan revealed and soothed. Structure (two main locations, single POV) is clear and anchored, and closure is decisive with the ice stilled. The main weakness is that each step unfolds without resistance or complication—Kaelen recalls the lore conveniently, finds the right mirror quickly, succeeds on the first spiritual attempt, and then resolves the leviathan’s pain in a paragraph. Closure exists but lacks a felt price or narrowing of options, so the arc reads competent rather than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story is structurally clean: one continuous scene with a stable POV and an accumulative lyric drive, anchored early in the drift-ice marina and her new volunteering routine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes endings as thresholds and her own planned death as something she can now relinquish; the line “She had come here to die, but after waking changed, she found a reason to live fully in each moment” makes the before/after legible. Causality is soft but coherent—each trawling pass and reflection incrementally builds toward that stance shift. The main limitation is mild structural sameness in the middle (several similar trawl–reflect beats) that doesn’t tighten pressure so much as circle it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive: bus departs → solitude → reflection → reframed understanding → gentle vow. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the past is repriced and his role shifts from “guardian of grapes” to steward of connection—but the cost is muted and mostly asserted. Causality within this meditative mode is coherent, with the burned letter and memory of the earlier bus departure knitting the arc together. However, there is little structural tightening beyond deepening reflection, and some beats read like restatements rather than clear progressions.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward: Kael creates and consecrates a clearing, the parapet rises and stabilizes the echoes, then a brief time jump shows the aftermath with seekers arriving. Causality is clean and easy to follow, and the closure—Kael’s transition into ongoing stewardship with the wisdom now stabilized—lands as an Earned Stasis/RR. However, there is only a very soft tightening of pressure; nothing meaningfully complicates or endangers his aim, and the “weeks that followed” section summarizes rather than deepens conflict. The result feels coherent but low-dynamic, closer to a mythic vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean, linear accumulative structure: discovery → gathering stories → exhibition → communal response → quiet epilogue. Causality is coherent—her decision to document and display leads plausibly to the town’s engagement and emotional shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s relationship to its history is altered, and Elara’s “work is complete” in a legible before/after way. What limits the score is how frictionless the process feels; there are no serious obstacles or reversals testing this arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: retrieve crystal → experiment with fractured sounds → realize language still grows → resolve to testify and speak. Causality holds and the closure unit (her decision and first clear speaking) is legible, with a before/after in her stance and in the world’s conceptual rules. The main weakness is that opposing forces (social fixity, her own silence) never press back in a concrete way, so the cost at closure feels light. Still, as an accumulative, single-scene arc it lands coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative quest: he tries to reach the garden’s core using driftwood and chalk, approaches a climax at the fog-throne, fails when the chalk snaps, and settles into a new stance. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each attempt (markers, map, following visions) slightly varies his approach against the same constraint. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the failure to capture the sound redefines the value of seeking and forgetting, with a clear before/after in his stance. The only limitation is that individual beats can blur together rhythmically, so some turns feel like variations rather than distinct escalations.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads cleanly as an accumulative, single-scene lyric with a coherent throughline: tremors threaten the observatory, the flare is imminent, she must rework the clock and camera in time. Causality within the poetic mode holds: the spinning hand embodies the problem, the leaf-sound trigger initiates the restructuring, the flare is captured, the clock stilled. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: time’s flow is altered locally, the image is secured, and her relationship to ephemerality is reweighted with cost (ache). Stakes remain mostly abstract/cosmic rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this below the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is clean: diagnosis → Elara’s plan → recording and call → reunion → death → Elara continues her work; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after. However, escalation is soft—obstacles are minimal and everything unfolds without real resistance or complication. The latter third leans on summary (“In the following days…”) instead of dramatizing critical beats, reducing structural sharpness. Still, the story holds together coherently under a largely accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: rune research → discovery of key → activation of automaton → map revelation → ritual → partial repair → new problem (broken key, deeper awakenings). Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in the world (shadows returning at noon). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a sequel hook; the cost is conceptual and object-based rather than deeply personal. Some pivotal beats are compressed into exposition (e.g., “She spent hours cross-referencing texts”) which keeps the arc from feeling fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual-like scene where grief over the substitute body leads Elara to use the tooth and bone-setting to mend a rift between worlds, closing in a clear before/after stance shift. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of objects (tooth, garden, constellations/fireflies) coheres and culminates. However, escalation is modest; events feel preordained once she enters the garden, and there’s little sense that any choice could meaningfully fail or backfire. The closure is a valid resonant reconfiguration but carries a relatively soft sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: descent into grotto → polishing and memory-deepening → discovery of the light effect → decision to leave and share it. Causality is intact and motivation-driven: her long-held goal leads logically to the method (polishing) and then to the projected light, which in turn crystallizes the choice to re-engage with the village. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a new stance toward others and toward her own “earthbound” condition, with the sea glass and its implications as the hinge. The main limitation is that the decisive beat carries modest on-page cost and never feels truly pressured, so the structural turn, while clear, is gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: movement through the space, perception of the icicle pattern, decision crystallizing around the pendant, and the pact with Leo form a coherent arc. Orientation (who/where/when) is handled early and efficiently, and the viral confession frames the stakes without temporal confusion. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—reframing the confession as “pruning” and the pendant transfer as the first deliberate regrowth. The main limitation is that the cost of this shift remains mostly conceptual; the scene unfolds without any real resistance or complication once Leo appears.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure—serial cameos of hope building to a final consecration—is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the collection, reorients her relationship to creativity, and the nexus itself alters in response. However, stakes and cost remain abstract, so the “whisper of closing pages” functions more as a tonal deadline than a sharp structural constraint. No major causality breaks, but progression is more linear than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal line is clean: Elara arrives with a goal, uses the vine and forgotten songs at a key moment of alignment, and the arbor is restored—clear beginning, middle activation, and restorative ending. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure (arbor renewed, legacy revived) is legible and on-page. However, the path contains no meaningful obstacles or reversals; once she starts singing, restoration flows without resistance, so structural pressure feels light. The alignment “timeframe” functions more as a poetic inevitability than a live constraint that might disrupt her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: preparation, enactment, sealing, and a quiet reconfiguration at the end all follow clearly. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—once the plate is sealed, the orchard and world’s stillness are subtly reweighted and the artifact exists with a new, stable charge. However, the “unseen event” and global breath-holding never concretely affect options or force a change in tactics, so pressure stays low. Causality is intact but the sense of consequential choice is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: we move from investigation, to insight about the timer’s purpose, to successful repair and deployment, to departure with a reweighted understanding of echoes. Causality is clean at the conceptual level—his method leads to the key realization and then to working technology. Closure is present as a quiet conceptual repricing (echoes as memories of space, reason as keeper of wonder), but the global drive never tightens into a true dilemma or hard constraint. The result feels polished but low-pressure, more meditative process than plotted test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is linear and legible: she enters the grotto, processes a series of burdens, and emerges changed. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each calcification adds weight (literally and figuratively) toward a closure where her relationship to burdens is reconfigured, which lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is mostly ritualistic rather than dramatic—she orients properly, therefore a burden calcifies—with little sense that events could go otherwise. The ending’s cost (endless future labor, emotional exhaustion) is more inferred than sharply articulated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure—a single scene bounded by the boiling kettle—reads cleanly, with a clear before (blank ash, unprocessed grief) and after (finished carving, slightly eased heart). The accumulative drive lens (each stroke deepening her stance toward loss) holds to the end, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she chooses to live with grief by containing it in art. Causality is simple but coherent: rain/loft → carving window → whistle → completion and small shift. Stakes never misfire, but the arc is predictable and lacks a sharper structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival at lagoon → wading through kinetic water and story-fragments → island confrontation with ghost → offering the wheel and conceptual shift. Causality holds under an accumulative, interior lens: each physical move into the lagoon deepens pressure toward the final realization. Closure is solid—a resonant reconfiguration where she reinterprets time and leaves the wheel behind at felt cost. Stakes remain primarily internal and modest, but the piece achieves a satisfying before/after without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: exploration → discovery of sextant → decision to resurrect via redirected flows → gradual activation → symbolic departure. The piece closes on a clear reconfiguration (the terminal from ruin to sanctuary-in-waiting, Kaelen from technician to theorist of hope), satisfying the closure requirement under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. However, the absence of setbacks or complications keeps the structural arc relatively flat. The story reads more as an extended, graceful vignette than a tightened narrative with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors, moving from approach → work on the clock → internal reframing → departure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the gradual layering of sensory detail and memory leads to an on-page conceptual repricing of her dream. Causality is modest but coherent: the rain enables the whispers, which trigger reflection, which culminates in acceptance. The resolution risks feeling slightly preordained, with no real possibility that she might fail to reconcile, which softens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent: single scene, accumulative reflection, culminating in the shadow falling on the crack and the reframing of the quest. Causality is more thematic than event-driven, but the sundial’s repositioning serves as a clear hinge. Closure as conceptual repricing is legible—before she seeks the bell, after she recognizes betrayal/truth. The main weakness is that interim beats often reiterate the same idea (“architecture of lies,” “training instincts,” “salvage truth”) without much new pressure or information.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival on the dock, decoding the rope, summoning the weavers, receiving their lore, and leaving with a new role, with no orientation issues. Causality is straightforward (decode → weavers appear → knowledge transferred → role shift), and closure is legible as a decisive reconfiguration of her purpose. However, the path is almost frictionless; there are no meaningful setbacks, complications, or conditional “ifs” that generate suspense. The cost of success is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the plot from feeling fully earned at a high-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear: arrival in the garden → ritual with the thread → immersion in Kael’s past → realization about absences → quiet exit. Causality holds under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when Elara reframes absence as charged space and lets the thread go dull. Stakes stay modest and inward, but the before/after in her understanding is legible. A slight sense of repetition in the middle softens structural sharpness but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: prince discovers egg → theorizes → assembles device → hatches spectral bird; the drive lens is essentially causal with an accumulative lyric overlay. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph and the single-scene structure is easy to follow. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: beauty literally and symbolically returns, the world “pauses,” and his quest is fulfilled. However, the central problem encounters no major reversal or real risk, so the path from setup to success feels smoothed rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves causally from preparation, to grafting, to transference of the coin, to quiet resolution. The global drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine—each concrete act (mixing sand, grafting, gifting the coin) layers toward the final repricing of her lineage as healing rather than destruction. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes the coin and receives the girl’s “scar song” as proof of redeemed purpose. The stakes are modest and there’s no strong turn in options, but the before/after in her internal stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: geese-pause window → breadcrumb fountains → shard-collection → star alignment → box opening → city restored. Structure is coherent and linear with one clear escalation into the night-wait and alignment sequence. Closure lands as a decisive change plus reconfiguration of the city and her stance, with no major orientation or logic slips. The only limitation is that obstacles are largely procedural, so the climax feels assured rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: sonar mapping → anomaly → ancestral mechanism → recognition of decline → tactical repurposing of sonar for legacy. Causality holds under a textural/causal hybrid lens, and the closure—a decisive shift from preservation of the garden to preservation of its memory—lands with conceptual cost (the garden must die). The timeline and spatial logic are legible despite the cosmic scale, and there’s a clear before/after in how “sharing light” is conceived. Some steps (e.g., the gear’s analytical leap to “truth”) are more told than dramatized, but they don’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear drive from entering the greenhouse to achieving an understanding of grief, and the accumulative lens (ritual over days) is coherent. Closure is present—her conceptual shift about grief and the grandfather fading reads as a resolved unit—but the “cost” is soft and largely declarative. Escalation across the days of migration is more stated than dramatized; few beats hinge on concrete turning points. The piece sometimes reads like a paraphrased outline of a longer story rather than a fully pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: pendulum hitch → descent to tools → consultation of rake handle inscriptions → careful recalibration → emotional shift. Closure exists as a decisive inner change (self-forgiveness) tied to the technical repair, so the before/after is conceptually clear. Yet the external problem never meaningfully resists him—no setback, miscalculation, or time pressure complicates the repair—and the emotional resolution seems to arrive because the story declares it rather than because events corner him into a new stance. Structure is coherent but lacks a tightening turn that would give the climax weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the clock runs down, she feels drawn to the silo, opens the case, works the tapestry, finds the journal, and reinterprets the cemetery. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the outset, and the piece lands a recognizable closure in her assuming the unfinished mission. Yet most developments are frictionless and conveniently timed (the thread snapping to reveal the compartment, the tapestry quickly yielding a full grave-map), so escalation and complication feel underplayed. The closure has conceptual weight but lacks a sharply rendered price or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene in the spire builds toward the decision to write, culminating in the lake’s thaw as closure. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: thinking → modeling → refined choice → writing → external echo. The decisive change (from poised hesitation to committed action with visible world response) lands clearly on the page. The main limitation is that much of the “plot” unfolds as exposition of models rather than dramatized turns, so escalation feels more cerebral than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: famine → discovery of broadcast → decoding → dust responding → embedding codes → mutual recognition with the broadcaster → charged sanctuary. Causality holds and each step follows logically from the last, but many turns are narrated in summary rather than dramatized as discrete scenes. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—her alcove becomes a pocket world where the famine is, in principle, defied—yet the price of that stance is only softly sketched. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rocking chair → mask ritual → grinding → drawing → reconfiguration of her stance toward her grandfather. Causality is coherent, with each action materially enabling the next and the final image delivering a clear resonant reconfiguration (acceptance replacing the mirage of safety). The scene stays in one temporal and spatial frame with no orientation debt. While the arc is more textural than dramatic, the closure lands decisively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is essentially one continuous scene of excavation threaded with reflective context, which suits an accumulative/textural lens. The closure beat—discovering the brass plate with tidal equations and settling into renewed purpose—functions as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration: the work feels justified, the weight of duty briefly eases. Causality is simple but coherent: she descends, digs, finds evidence that validates her project, reinforcing her stance. The cost (lonely, grinding duty against cultural tides) is largely declared rather than dramatized, which keeps the ending from fully landing at a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: library search → discovery of rosette → application in rehearsal, with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she recommits to ongoing work with a modest but tangible improvement in the choir’s unity. However, the turns are gentle; the hunt for the rosette never feels in doubt, and the rehearsal proceeds with little resistance, so the central beats lack sharp inflection. The global drive reads as largely accumulative/textural, and while coherent, the cost at the end is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: alignment approaches, she plants the seed, it sprouts, she feels renewed. Causality is coherent but low-pressure, with no meaningful turn beyond “she plants” and “it works.” Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration—she stands in a greenhouse that has shifted symbolically from decay to hope—but the cost is only lightly implied and never tested. Large blocks of thematic explanation slow structural momentum rather than deepening a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → riddle → interpretation → tower “weeping” → reboot → Elara’s quiet repricing of routine and wonder. Structure is linear and clear, with one main tightening (the climb and activation of the rods). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s role redefined as guarding wonder rather than just toll-keeping, though the emotional and material cost is mild. The extended epilogue paragraphs after the system reboot repeat the resolution rather than deepening it, slightly softening structural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is straightforward and legible: arrival at cottage → ritual with orris root → perceptible shift in the house → interior exploration → conceptual realization. Causality holds (her act prompts the house’s “sigh” and awakens her understanding), and the accumulative/textural lens is consistent. However, the “cost” aspect of closure is underplayed—nothing significant is lost, risked, or foreclosed, and the epiphany is relatively soft. The final beats reweight the premise conceptually, but without a strong sense of consequence, the closure is more serene than powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clear: a sequence of linked revelations (library, submerged city, statue’s origin, voluntary sacrifice, community of guardians) culminating in a redefined role. Causality under an accumulative lens holds—the ampoule activation leads to intensified revelations and the awakening of other guardians. However, many crucial beats are reported as “the statue learned” rather than dramatized, which flattens on-page tension and makes the escalation largely informational. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing of guardianship, but the cost remains more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene on the staircase with a clear build from ascent → calculations → rupture → conceptual revaluation. Causality in an accumulative/textural sense holds: her persistent mathematical work leads to the crack and the world-moment of stasis. Closure is a recognizable conceptual repricing—she redefines perpetual motion and her relationship to the staircase and the missed opportunity. The main limitation is that the turn arrives with little on-page resistance; the rupture and realization follow quickly once invoked, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—ritual setup, successive visions, then the global network image—holds together cleanly and teaches its pattern early. Each daydream incrementally advances her project of gathering evidence, culminating in a conceptual shift where kindness is seen as a global, trans-temporal fabric. Closure is solid: she descends with a reconfigured certainty and an ongoing task, which reads as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis. The main limitation is the relative lightness of on-page cost; the story never forces a truly difficult trade-off or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: beekeeper’s absence → ledger discovery → failed attempt → lens revelation → cliff honey → successful bread, landing in a solid Resonant Reconfiguration. The opera glass clue is slightly convenient but not implausible, and the story maintains a coherent throughline under a causal drive lens. Closure has a legible before/after—cultural paralysis to a tentative thaw—with emotional cost in Elara’s earlier failure and dread. Stakes stay at community-memory scale, but they are followed through without dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: low tide reveals the stone → Elara links it to the yoyo → she reverse-engineers chance → she triggers the clocks → the world unwinds. The piece delivers on closure with an on-page decisive change and conceptual repricing: the world’s temporal rules invert and destiny itself is shattered at visible cost. Stakes and events escalate in a single continuous arc without causality breaks or disorienting jumps. The main limitation is that the process unfolds almost too smoothly; no serious setbacks or structural complications test her resolve or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: she enters the funhouse to trick fear, follows the advisor, uses the dictionary to reinterpret symbols, exposes fear’s dependence, and then weaponizes the clasp and luminance to seal it. The drive lens is solidly causal, with each step flowing from the previous realization or instruction. Closure is decisive and legible—mirror cleared, advisor gone, inner state altered—with a conceptual repricing of “void” that reweights earlier beats. The main structural weakness is that the climactic confrontation resolves quickly and without much on-page resistance once she identifies fear’s weakness, blunting some potential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: the looming silence, the building of the resonant field, and the climactic wave all follow a clear causal chain under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is on-page and legible—the orchard survives and is transformed into a more complex carillon, fulfilling the “obstacles into instruments” promise. The main weakness is that the success feels nearly effortless; no prior tactic fails or even strains, and the cost of victory is minimal. Still, for this length, the single tightening and decisive act at the end are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: closed gate and missing expedition → Kaelen’s pattern inquiry → whistle-melody experiment → crack → vision and explanation → reconfigured status quo. Closure is present and legible: the city’s dread is conceptually repriced, with the cost that isolation and the shut gate remain. The main structural weakness is that the watchers’ motives and the “spiritual decay” are delivered in a compressed explanatory block that feels slightly like an information drop rather than fully dramatized discovery. Still, orientation is excellent and the drive lens (causal with conceptual repricing) holds cleanly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: rosebush beat → decision to begin → analysis of letter → discovery of “veritas” → interpretive resolution. Structure holds as a single coherent scene with reflection interleaved, and closure is legible as a decisive knowledge shift and revaluation of the scribe. Still, the discovery feels too frictionless—no serious false turn or resistance tests her premise—and the cost of success remains mostly abstract. The drive lens reads as Causal but with underexploited pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: the bridge rises, he works through his ritual of inserting notes, and he reaches a contained, earned stasis by sealing his own confession into the submerged step and waiting for release. Causality is simple but coherent—everything follows from his decision to be trapped with the pavilion until his task is complete. Closure lands as an internal reconfiguration (mending his “foundation within himself”) tied to an external completed task. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds steadily, though escalation is more tonal than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the blackout, with a clear causal chain from failed standard method → alternative hypothesis → tactile investigation → discovery of hidden scrolls → reframed understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis when she accepts an “honest, complicated story” over a neat index. Stakes and cost (abandoning the official narrative she once served) are legible but primarily intellectual. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, though escalation is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine—shadow loss → vow to fold cranes and polish dreams → intensifying work → cranes stir → shadow returns—reads cleanly and closure lands on the page with a visible change. Structure is basically a single extended sequence with time compressed via summary; transitions are smooth and orientation is never in doubt. The cost of the process (painful emotional excavation) is present, though escalation between beats can feel a bit uniform rather than sharply turning. Overall, the piece satisfies a hybrid causal/accumulative design with a solid, if not breathtaking, ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: entering the chamber, deploying the geode, escalating data, feedback overload, then blackout-triggered realization. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why) and the observatory downtime provides a simple but legible structural frame. Closure works as a conceptual repricing: the central “hunt” for an external reservoir flips into the recognition that what he sought is omnipresent and structurally inescapable, with an emotional cost. The only limitation is that the key turn (the knowing in darkness) arrives via a somewhat mystical, unmediated leap rather than a visibly pressured choice or inference chain.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drone investigation → anomaly → lever → dome alignment → prism projection → chip decoding → inner shift. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after marked by the activation of the matrix chip and the resonant tone. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in which Kael moves from searching to feeling anchored, but the path is frictionless: problems (garbled output) yield to a single recalibration and lucky discovery. The lack of substantial obstacles or consequences keeps the structure from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clear: guilt → ritual return to shore → discovery of her old carving → revelation of the brother’s death → vow to change. Structure is straightforward two-shard (terrace → shore → terrace), with a legible Earned Stasis/Decisive Change at the end. The key turn—the withheld truth surfacing as “he died alone”—is delivered in summary rather than dramatized discovery, which blunts some impact. Nonetheless, before/after is unmistakable and the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous negotiation scene with clear causal steps from setup to handshake to internal release. Closure lands via a decisive change—agreement on a new protocol and Elara’s felt lightness after shedding her guilt. Yet the path to that closure is low-friction; there’s no serious setback, misstep, or complication after the initial proposal, so the arc feels more like a smooth progression than a pressured turn. Still, orientation is excellent and the drive lens (situational with light causal scaffolding) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: broken tool → compromised method (utility poles) → worsening water → loss of heirloom → on-page revaluation that powers the ending. The piece maintains single-scene continuity with no orientation issues, and the closure—abandoning the broken compass in favor of humble, present guides—lands as a Decisive Change with emotional cost. Escalation is modest but coherent, with the near-capsize and loss of the compass as the main tightening. Structure is solid but somewhat linear and predictable, without a surprising reconfiguration of options beyond the obvious symbolic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—newspaper codes → underground descent → labyrinth/lake → choices with the baseball → confrontation with his reflection → partial restoration of memory/empathy—is coherent and linear. Closure is on-page and legible: he moves from seeking erasure to accepting and integrating his past, a decisive change with conceptual cost. However, the structure leans expository, with several summarizing sentences and little dramatized resistance or complication en route to the already signaled transformation. The drive lens is largely causal with some accumulative texture, and it holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: grief → ritual preparation → conjuring → metamorphosis → crossing → reunion → new role, with each step following plausibly from the last. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara cannot return to her old self and instead earns a charged new stasis as guardian of thresholds with Kael. Stakes and price are visible on the page, and there is no orientation confusion despite the mythic setting. The main limitation is that the path never seriously wavers or complicates once the ritual begins, so structural tension feels somewhat foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the glade → ritual setup → vision of lost time → reweaving hours into the cloth → departure with reframed goal. Causality is simple but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure (she doesn’t recover time but changes her stance toward it) lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and the ritual’s purpose are quickly legible. The main limitation is that the central “trial” of the ritual unfolds without strong uncertainty about outcome, so structural tension plateaus rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: studying the photographs → accumulating shimmer via Kwan Yin’s tear → intensifying effort → opening the locked dimension and crossing. The piece holds a mostly continuous scene with a clear drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) and lands an on-page decisive change. Cost is present but somewhat conceptual (leaving the ship and shadows), and the resistance of the locked dimension feels lightly sketched rather than truly jeopardizing success. Structure is clean, but escalation could be more palpably arduous or uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: landslide → detour → beach → ritual of release → volcano’s awakening and inner realization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her stance toward loss and transformation is clearly different at the end, and the volcano’s response externalizes that shift. Yet many key beats (the local legends, history of unintended consequences, prophecy) are summarized rather than dramatized, and coincidence/prophecy carry more weight than her on-page struggle. The cost of her choice (giving up the last treasured possession) is acknowledged but underplayed, keeping the structure competent rather than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward: blackout → sundial cipher → armory compartment → leaflet distribution → charged waiting, and the single-POV window is clear with no orientation issues. However, the piece reads more like a cleanly narrated plan execution than a pressured plot—nothing meaningfully threatens to derail her or force adaptation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she has set the revolution in motion and waits in the dark, but the cost or irrevocability isn’t sharply dramatized. Repetitive restatements of her aim in the final third undercut structural tightness and make the progression feel flatter than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: promise → nightly sequences → rare aurora alignment → near-mistake with the rock → corrected sequence → aurora beam → harnessed energy → lifted curse/understanding. The story maintains a single scene with clear spatial and temporal anchoring and lands a decisive change (curse lifted, world’s chaos reconfigured) on the page. The main weakness is that the world-scale stakes resolve very quickly and smoothly once the rock is corrected, with minimal friction or price at the climax. Still, the structure is coherent and closure satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain (mysterious envelope → journey to observatory → timer countdown → writing → arrival of the stranger) is clean and easy to follow, with the timer providing useful structural scaffolding. Closure lands: the vigil moves from suspension to action as she begins writing uncensored poetry and shares it. The cost and danger of this choice, however, remain largely abstract—no concrete consequence or risk is dramatized. The ex-censor’s entrance exactly at the timer’s ding reads convenient but not destructive to coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: decode sundial → reveal scroll → duel → philosophical revelation and collaboration; orientation in time/place/POV is strong throughout. The drive is mostly causal with a light thematic overlay, and closure lands via a Decisive Change/RR when they abandon rivalry for a joint school of thought. However, the decoding process resolves too easily, the “terms of engagement” never feel precarious, and there are no turns that seriously threaten failure, so cost at closure is muted. The structure is sound but somewhat outline-like in its inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc framed by moonrise-to-dawn, with backstory (prison library) anchored and well-integrated. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the steady work of rebuilding and the repeated handling of the poems build toward a quiet RR/Charged Poise closure in the dawn moment where their purpose crystallizes. The cost—living precariously, committing to a slow, possibly dangerous resistance—is more implied than concretely tested, which softens impact. Still, the before/after of Elara’s stance and the library’s status as “beacon” are legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the arbor’s instability worsens (compasses, atmosphere), forcing Elian to execute his theorized escape via the altered projector and film, which leads to the refuge and the final encore that reconfigures his fate. Orientation is solid from the outset—who, where, and when are quickly legible—and the story holds a single coherent drive through to a clear closure beat (he remains in the refuge with time reset). The cost is present but somewhat soft: we infer that remaining in the film-world is a trade-off, yet the emotional or practical loss of the old world is only lightly sketched. Structure is otherwise tight, with no major causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: impending monsoon → need to secure memory → dream method → planting the seed → harvesting and safeguarding fruits, culminating in a stable stasis. Closure is present (the cultural memory is secured and her stance settles), but the story leans heavily on summary cadence in the later lines, reiterating the outcome instead of sharpening the final turn. Structural simplicity works at this length, yet the absence of any serious complication or reversal keeps the arc from feeling truly earned or costly. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with a mild accumulative texture, held consistently but without surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: setup with Elian and the compass, the instructional middle with the lace, and the shoreline walk leading to the locket and return. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece steadily layers instructions, ritual, and memory until the closure beat where the locket and matched lace reconfigure what “unspoken apologies” mean. Causality is generally sound, though the discovery of the exact locket in the cove leans on convenient symbolism rather than pressure-driven inevitability. Closure is on-page and legible as a resonant reconfiguration of Kaelen’s stance toward his regrets.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure fails the scene-based expectation, functioning instead as a summarized timelapse ("Each day... she returned") without a specific anchor moment. The closure is a restatement of the premise ("drama was an illusion") reached without obstruction or cost, lacking a decisive dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.4)
    The central turning point relies on a catastrophic causality break: frost patterns on a rock spontaneously mirroring and deciphering specific smudged numbers in a charcoal ledger is implausible magical thinking that shatters the mystery frame. The resolution (identifying the rival) arrives via this coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The plot logic collapses under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story follows a linear Accumulative structure to a Conceptual Repricing (prison to stage), but the lack of obstacle or failure creates a flat trajectory. The physical logic of the heat-mapping (pressing a cool fork to the forehead to dye glass) is confusing and under-explained, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis of events rather than a dramatized scene, covering a long journey and days of research in summary. Causality is severely broken by a Deus Ex Machina solution ("The method came to him in a dream") that resolves the central problem without agency or cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without earning it through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("In the days that followed") instead of a dramatized scene with causal pressure. The ending is a speech followed by a generalized summary of success, lacking a decisive on-page turn with visible cost. The logic of the anonymous donations removes necessary narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear sequence, but causality is driven by dream logic and convenience rather than obstacle and reaction. The closure offers a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (total healing) without a preceding struggle or paid cost, resulting in an unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the resolution relies on "technobabble" (channeling geometric paradoxes) rather than a grounded mechanism. The closure is undermined by explicit cost negation ("disintegration was not destruction but transformation"), robbing the climax of weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is fundamentally broken; waiting for a distant wall to collapse before searching a local piano bench lacks logical linkage. The closure relies on unearned magic (immediate seed growth) that contradicts the established gritty tone, offering a "happy ending" with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on linear summary and weak causality; Elara "works," "realizes," and "succeeds" without distinct, pressure-filled beats. The closure feels symmetrical and convenient—the task ends simply because the story does—rather than resulting from a decisive reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak; the flower codes change instantly to "black orchids," implying a magical or mechanical system that is never established, creating a logic gap. The climax is resolved via *Deus Ex Machina*, where the magic tool (moonbeams) conveniently reveals a never-before-mentioned escape route, removing protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative lacks causal drive; the protagonist simply performs a task and feels better without a forcing move or obstacle. The "thaw" is a parallel event, not a result of agency, and the resolution (feeling "free to experiment") feels unearned by the low-stakes process shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.1)
    The resolution breaks causality; the antagonist is defeated by a thematic speech rather than a tactical maneuver, effectively a "soft reset" of the conflict. The cryptographic breakthrough is handled as a convenient leap ("finding patterns in the chaos") without showing the process or error. Closure is asserted via summary ("forever changed") rather than a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" progression lacking causal pressure or a decisive turning point. Closure is a form of symmetric satisfaction—the task is completed exactly as intended with no deviation, sacrifice, or recontextualization of the stakes. The "Orientation Test" passes, but the ending offers no cost to validate the "obsession."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear progression from setup to resolution, but the "amalgamation" functions as a soft reset that solves the central mystery without a legible price. The causality is internal and abstract ("focused its processing power"), lacking external friction or a Decisive Change that alters the status quo with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality is weak; the mechanic of magnifying "cryptic doodles" to reveal a "timeline of events" is physically implausible and serves as a magic-bullet solution. The resolution hinges on a coincidence (Marco emerging exactly then) and lacks a felt cost, resulting in a tidy, symmetrical ending that evaporates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a generalized summary of a ritual rather than a specific, dramatized scene with a causal arc. The arrival of the visitors resolves instantly without complication or cost, failing to create a distinct "beat" or meaningful closure. The reliance on explaining the protagonist's success ("Elara's pragmatic methods never did") removes all tension from the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedure (wait, pull lever, succeed) rather than a causal arc with complication; success is guaranteed by the premise. Closure fails the rubric's requirement for a felt or conceptual cost—the discovery is a "happy ending" acquisition of knowledge without price, consequence, or reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot operates on video-game logic (combine water + program = map) rather than earned causality or deduction. The resolution—slapping the water to solve a decades-old mystery—feels trivial and lacks the "felt cost" required for a high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on associative dream-logic rather than sturdy causality; the leap from noticing an insect in a drawing to successfully predicting a storm via "marginal correlations" strains credibility. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, but the stakes of the "swallowed truth" (the flower’s rarity) feel disproportionately low for the resulting shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    The climax hinges on a massive coincidence—tuning a radio to a specific confession at the exact moment of discovery—which resolves the mystery without genuine protagonist agency or deduction. The "method" is explained in an expository lump just in time to solve the problem, creating a Deus Ex Machina effect that flattens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows a circular structure (vignette loop) with a soft reset that lacks a decisive change or felt cost. The ending relies on a meta-summary to assert closure rather than dramatizing a shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from a lack of immediate, on-page causality; the breakthrough is asserted ("something shifted") rather than earned through specific action or tactical adaptation. The ending relies on a summary epilogue ("Years later") to prove the change, bypassing the requirement for a decisive, cost-laden closure within the scene itself. The pacing is sluggish, with no meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality collapses in the final third with the sudden introduction of a "device of his own invention" to resolve the central problem. This "magic wand" solution bypasses the need for ingenuity using the established elements (tapestry/diaries) and removes all cost from the closure. The narrative relies on convenient deductions ("he deduced," "he realized") rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates in broad summary without a single grounded scene, failing the orientation test as it spans an indefinite period rather than a specific moment. Causality is nonexistent; obstacles are overcome instantly by authorial assertion ("Together, they decided," "Leo... found it"), creating a flat outline rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the story has a linear progression, the causality relies on the narrator identifying the efficacy of the protagonist’s actions ("This chiasmus began to unravel the entity's certainty") rather than dramatizing the mechanism. The resolution is a conceptual fiat where abstract rhetorical questions defeat a physical threat without established logic. Closure is achieved, but it feels like an intellectual exercise rather than a narrative event.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a mechanical "and then" sequence with no causal friction or earned turning points. The closure is a "magic success" ending where the protagonist achieves her goal purely because the plot requires it, with no visible cost or sacrifice. The "exhaustion" mentioned is a declared stake that never actually forces a difficult trade-off or alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" structure driven by magical mechanics rather than causal pressure. While closure is technically present (integration, loss of power), the "procedural generation" acts as a convenient plot device rather than a source of escalating tension. The resolution is achieved through a soft reset—simply deciding to be whole—rather than a dramatized climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no complications: problem introduced, solution offered, solution works immediately. The causality relies on magical realism ("backward songs" revealing "primal beats") that is asserted rather than demonstrated. The closure is tidy and lacks a felt cost, as the protagonist gains healing without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails the on-page closure requirement, relying on a summary ending ("In the following days...") that explains the resolution rather than dramatizing a decisive moment with cost. Causality is weak, with key plot points driven by "intuition" rather than evidence or logical progression. The climax resolves instantly through a single line of dialogue, lacking necessary narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.7)
    The plot relies on a "magic key" coincidence where the protagonist's specific vial happens to unlock the plant's secret, removing causal agency. The closure is an "explain-everything" ending where the narrative summarizes the lesson learned rather than earning it through action. The drive lens is muddled by convenient mystical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the story follows a clear arc from observation to choice, the resolution hinges on "poetic logic" (channeling will into a rope) rather than established narrative causality. The mechanism of the climax is unearned, treating the rope as a magical conduit without prior setup, though the closure does render a clear state change.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative reads as a vignette or ritual description rather than a causal plot; there is no inciting incident or rising pressure, only a transition from a routine to a slightly more intense version of that routine. The ending ("harmonious incompletion") is a soft conceptual resolution without a legible cost or decisive change in the status quo. The "unbinding" mechanism lacks constraints, functioning as a "just so" magic system that solves the atmospheric problem without difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on repetitive summary transitions ("As the transformation completed") rather than causal scene work. The resolution is unearned, as the protagonist simply decides to change without navigating external obstacles, resulting in a "light switch" ending devoid of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.2)
    The text functions as a synopsis or outline rather than a dramatized story, summarizing weeks of events without a distinct scene or closure unit. There is no causality driven by resistance; obstacles are resolved immediately via exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("The shared search became a daily pilgrimage... After days of fruitless searching") rather than a specific, pressurized scene, violating the scope expectation for short fiction. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—she wants connection, finds the tag, and receives connection without any visible cost, risk, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where success feels inevitable; the "giant's nap" acts as a passive timer rather than an active pressure that forces adaptation. Closure lands with a stated rather than felt cost ("aged her slightly"), and the "lurch" of the world resolves too tidily without lasting consequence. The sequence is clear, but the causal density is low, reading as a list of events rather than a chain of forced choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot relies on arbitrary "magic box" mechanics where inputs (drips + eyes) conveniently produce a resolution. The closure functions as a soft reset of the protagonist's grief, lacking the causal rigor or earned cost required for a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist encounters no significant obstacles; the flickering lights provide atmospheric flavor rather than causal pressure. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved perfectly without cost or complication, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt price. The closure is tidy and unearned, resolving all tension via a convenient success.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with on-page closure (gathering branches), but the turning point relies on a convenient, low-pressure realization ("The true lesson was...") rather than a forced choice. The causality is soft; the storm does not force her hand so much as provide a backdrop for a spontaneous change of heart.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: walk, find object, trade, feel better. The ending is a "soft reset" where deep-seated trauma and insomnia are resolved by a single pleasant conversation, lacking any felt cost or decisive change. The closure feels unearned and symmetric, tidying up the conflict without narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no significant obstacles; the protagonist attempts one solution (the memory) and succeeds immediately without cost or complication. The ending devolves into a summary of future success ("magic blossomed," "became a permanent part") rather than an on-page closure unit with a felt price. Causality is soft, relying on the convenient functionality of the magic pearl rather than character agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing days ("Over the next few days") rather than dramatizing a specific scene with causal pressure. The resolution—finding a logbook and giving a speech—is a mechanical "symmetric satisfaction" without earned difficulty or cost. The coincidental appearance of a working trumpet at the climax dissolves the central problem without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction "fetch quest" structure where obstacles vanish immediately (mist parts, doors appear). The ending relies on a "magic fix" where punching a sphere resolves all internal and external conflicts without visible cost or sacrifice, violating the requirement for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where a magical object solves the central problem without cost or complication. The ending is a "soft reset" where the village’s weariness is cured by the transcription, lacking the "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" required for literary closure. The causal chain relies entirely on the artifact functioning as requested.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is functional and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear outcome, but the resolution relies heavily on the "dimensional awareness" trait acting as a convenient skeleton key. The narrative arc is linear, but the mechanism of the climax—channeling fields through his being—feels like abstract technobabble rather than a tactical choice with a tangible price beyond the loss of the amulet.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.4)
    The resolution relies entirely on a Deus Ex Machina; the ink pot solves the central conflict instantly, removing the need for a genuine confrontation or clever maneuver. The climax lacks causal pressure because the magic object guarantees success, rendering the "breach" purely mechanical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a static loop (ascent, routine, descent) without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or the requisite cost to achieve narrative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Weeks passed") and convenient coincidence (overhearing the exact officials discussing his case) rather than causal progression. The structure reads more like a synopsis than a dramatized story, and the resolution is delivered to the protagonist rather than earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of memories triggered by musical notes, lacking causal friction or active struggle. The resolution ("The riddle is you") is a conceptual cliché that feels unearned by the scene's low-pressure action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure: she plans to paint, she paints, she finishes. There is no inciting incident within the scene to disrupt her plan, nor a decisive turn that alters her trajectory or knowledge. The ending lacks a structural closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration), settling instead for a soft summary of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, functioning as a countdown without causal complications or meaningful obstacles. The closure (taking the photo) is a foregone conclusion from the first paragraph, lacking a decisive change or a felt cost paid on the page. The "inciting incident" is backstory, and the scene lacks a turning point where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is linear and lacks a decisive turn or reversal; the resolution relies on a logic-breaking "magical" fix (debugging code via water refraction) and arrives without any felt cost or sacrifice (Symmetric Satisfaction).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of events without genuine causal pressure or obstacles. The leap from observing condensation patterns to finding a specific geothermal vent is logically tenuous and convenient (a "magic map" solution). Closure is achieved (he finds the source), but the lack of resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or obstacle; the protagonist achieves his goal through a linear, resistance-free ritual. The resolution ("timeline corrected") acts as a deus ex machina, fixing the problem by fiat without earning the outcome through narrative pressure. The story functions as a static outline rather than a dramatic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the primary obstacle (the lock) is resolved by a convenient magical property of the vial (deus ex machina) rather than protagonist ingenuity. Closure is a tidy summary of success ("gift beyond measure") that lacks the required felt cost or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a metaphysical mechanic ("weaving story") that functions as a skeleton key, resolving the conflict without a specific, dramatized cost or difficult trade-off. The escape feels granted by the magical premise rather than earned through a distinct causal maneuver in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a low-agency linear sequence where a magical object resolves the central conflict instantly ("As he touched it... Memories flooded"). The "debt" is paid through a transactional hand-off without complication, resistance, or visible cost on the page. The closure feels unearned because the mechanism of resolution is external magic rather than character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure where magical actions resolve obstacles without causality or cost. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect fix with no tradeoffs—failing to provide the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative summarizes weeks of activity ("days that bled into weeks") rather than dramatizing a scene, violating short story scope. The resolution depends on a convenient magical coincidence (shadow pointing to a specific tree) and offers a "tidy" ending that explains all mystery without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a linear procedural (arrive, chalk, mail) lacking causal turns or genuine pressure. The mechanism linking the chalk marks to the letter's safety is asserted rather than demonstrated, and closure is a low-stakes task completion with no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a coherent causal path to a Decisive Change (blowing out the candle). However, the central investigation relies on an abstract magic system that solves plot problems with low friction ("pulled a silver thread... to show a different path"), making the discovery feel convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot progresses as a linear sequence of convenient magical assists (healing shard, instructional leaves) rather than through causal resistance or struggle. Closure is achieved, but the resolution—forgiveness—feels unearned because the environment solves the problem for her without extracting a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates on dream logic with weak physical grounding; holding a piece of coral during an anesthetic procedure strains plausibility without establishing a clear surrealist frame. The narrative lacks causal progression, relying on a static sequence of observations that resolves via a "soft reset" (drifting to sleep) rather than a decisive change or realization with cost. Orientation remains hazy regarding her actual physical location.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear success path ("and then she did this") with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks joy and finds it without paying a price—resulting in a low-tension vignette rather than a causally driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and then" structure with low causality; events happen to the protagonist rather than because of her. The closure functions as a "soft reset" or "explain-everything" moment ("complete a cycle of enlightenment") without earned narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a convenient technobabble resolution—sound waves creating "dissonance" with the warp—that acts as a soft magic fix rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's skills. The orientation is functional, but the climax lacks a "because/therefore" chain; the victory is granted by the interaction of the prop and the anomaly, not a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative relies on broad summary and "telling" over centuries rather than a cohesive scene with causal linkage. The climax is an external report delivered by the wind, not a result of the protagonist's agency or a specific decision under pressure. Causality is broken by the vast timeframe which glosses over the actual mechanism of change, leaving the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a low-stakes "fetch quest" structure where the protagonist faces no meaningful obstacles; she immediately recalls the solution, retrieves the item, and succeeds. The resolution is a "soft reset" that restores the status quo without exacting a visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a mechanical linear path where the protagonist performs a ritual in isolation that perfectly resolves the central conflict without resistance. The ending relies on a *deus ex machina*—the mentor entering exactly on cue—rendering the closure unearned. The "risk" of the ink is stated but never materializes as a genuine causal obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.0)
    The resolution relies on a convenient "magic fix" where unspecified "subtle adjustments" and whispering to the stone solve an "impossible" structural problem. Causality breaks at the climax; the transition from analyzing glue to successfully recalibrating massive stone gates lacks mechanical logic. The ending offers a "perfect" solution with no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative fails the default scope requirements, functioning as a synopsis of weeks rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. The resolution relies on an unearned *Deus ex machina* (the grandfather's letter) and a convenient memory lapse, bypassing the necessary causal struggle. The closure is delivered via summary rather than a dramatized decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative logic relies on abstract associations (wood grain explaining the butterfly effect) rather than causal or cumulative pressure. The resolution is unearned; the protagonist simply realizes a metaphor and reality stabilizes, lacking any visible or felt cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension "and-then" structure without causal tightening. The ending relies on a cost-free realization ("She realized that...") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of stakes. The connection between the feather, the library logs, and the creature appearance is coincidental and thematic rather than causally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a passive observational loop: Kaelen looks into the glass, conjectures, and receives an answer without obstacle or cost. The resolution is an unearned epiphany delivered by the magic system, lacking a decisive change or felt price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is fundamentally broken; the protagonist’s "analysis" functions as clairvoyance (predicting a breeze’s exact path for rose petals), dissolving narrative logic. The story lacks a valid closure unit with cost, ending in a circular summary of success that resets to the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear process description ("and then") lacking causal friction or a pivot point where the outcome is in doubt. The closure is a symmetric satisfaction of the goal—she wants the tattoo and gets it—without a resonant reconfiguration of stakes or a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of contemplation rather than causal turns, resolving via a "pathetic fallacy" where the sun rises exactly at the moment of epiphany. This coincidence acts as a soft reset, providing symmetric satisfaction without an earned, costly change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story lacks a causal drive lens; it is a static vignette of walking and thinking with no inciting incident or rising action. Closure is an unearned "soft reset" ("heart lighter") triggered by abstract reflection rather than a decisive change or paid cost. The narrative loops without progression, offering a symmetric satisfaction that ignores the need for narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure ("Symmetric Satisfaction") lacking a decisive change with felt cost; the ending resolves mechanically via a "magic fix" rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on convenience ("Suddenly, her boot scuffed") rather than active pursuit or causality. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" based on expository backstory reading, lacking a felt, dramatized cost in the present moment. The inciting incident is accidental, and the climax is purely internal summary.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural: intent, action, success, exit. There is no causal turn where a plan fails or options narrow; the ending is a soft stop (the bells ring) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a foregone conclusion with no meaningful deviations or causal complications. While closure is technically achieved through the protagonist's sacrifice, the mechanism is purely magical and expository; the transition from "centuries of hatred" to peace is unearned by the scene's dynamics. The "price" is stated as a rule rather than discovered or wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative loop is structurally sound, with the drought ironically creating the map required for the act of absolution. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, though the magical mechanics of the egg release feel slightly convenient and disconnected from the established "industrialist" reality. The pacing works well within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a successful outcome without a significant reversal or cost paid on the page. While the closure (transformation) is structurally present, it feels unearned because the risk ("risk everything") remains theoretical and the "residue" of the past offers only token resistance. The ending is a "level up" rather than a choice with trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story is a reflective "thinking scene" that resolves a backstory conflict (the argument) rather than a present-tense causal chain. Orientation is functional, but the closure—a mental decision about future performance—lacks an immediate, visible cost on the page. The narrative drive is circular, resting on stated realizations rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative forms a coherent ritualistic vignette with legible orientation and closure. However, the progression is linear and lacks causal tightening; the outcome is inevitable from the start, and the protagonist's actions are procedural rather than reactive to shifting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully reaches closure with a tangible cost (the scrap crumbling to dust). However, the causality relies on convenient "dream logic" (a vision provided the method) rather than active problem-solving. The orientation and pacing are functional, though the linear progression lacks a decisive turning point or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a decisive closure event (leaving the bunker). However, the resolution relies on dream-logic convenience—the interpretation simply "reveals" the answer—rather than a causal chain of earned actions. The orientation is solid, but the mechanics of the solution feel somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure with a symmetric satisfaction ending that resolves all tension without cost. The inciting incident and resolution are mechanically linked by a "magic button" object, lacking causal friction or a Decisive Change that forces a trade-off. The closure is a soft reset where a simple action fixes a complex regime transition perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot follows a linear path to a "magic fix" resolution where the music box solves the central conflict without cost or complication. The narrative lacks a causal chain of choices; instead, the mechanism of "cellular memory" acts as a convenient device to bypass the necessary struggle of forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where intention leads directly to success without complication or cost. The "imperfect quest" and "broken sextant" suggest constraints that never materialize into actual obstacles, resulting in a low-tension procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary with the transition "Weeks passed," dissipating tension and violating the immediate scene scope. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the conflict resolves via a coincidence (the daughter's return) rather than a costly, earned decision by the protagonist. The ending lacks the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot relies on convenient epiphanies ("Suddenly, she understood") triggered by looking in a mirror rather than causal pressure or investigation. The resolution is an intellectual decision made during a "respite," lacking a dramatized climax where the stakes are truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot follows a linear fetch-quest structure where solutions (the diary, the specific gap, the mental shift) appear conveniently to resolve obstacles without friction. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the timeline simply "heals"—without a Decisive Change or felt cost to the protagonist. Causality is soft; the connection between a gardener's diary and the library's secret code feels arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot creates a straight line from desire to acquisition, lacking the causal complexity or meaningful obstacles required for a high-band score. The "magic" (narrative threads) functions as a convenient skeleton key that dissolves barriers without cost, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist gains everything (solace, truth) without paying a felt price. Closure is purely additive, missing the "Resonant Reconfiguration" or "Conceptual Repricing" demanded by the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on extreme convenience; the protagonist happens to have the exact required artifact in her pocket and the specific rope is within reach. Causality is weak, as solutions arise from sudden "knowing" rather than logical progression or trial and error. The closure is a "soft reset" that restores the diplomat with "perfect, lasting clarity," lacking the required on-page cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where a magical solution is applied and immediately works. While the protagonist leaves the stone behind (a technically visible cost), the lack of prior dramatic weight attached to the object renders the closure transactional rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with low tension, as the protagonist's power eliminates the risk of failure in the alignment process. Closure is achieved mechanically without a visible or felt cost; the resolution relies on a convenient convergence explicitly framed as destiny rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.1)
    The structure is a linear tour of monuments without causal linkages or rising pressure; the protagonist moves from A to B to C effortlessly. The closure relies on an internal epiphany ("identity wasn't carved from solitary events") that resolves the premise without any visible or conceptual cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of uncomplicated success: arrival, ritual, victory, departure. There is no on-page cost or resistance to the protagonist's goals; the "gravity of hopelessness" yields immediately to his magic without extracting a price. Closure is achieved through a "magic fix" that resolves the central tension instantly, lacking the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence, but causality is weak; a relationship deadlock is resolved instantly by a metaphor, lacking genuine friction or earned turns. The closure—a mutual agreement to "transform"—feels unearned because the initial obstacle (fear of leaving) evaporates without a visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear setup and resolution that recontextualizes the bunker (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the mechanics of the ascent—specifically a tether reaching above the clouds—strain credibility, and the middle section lacks a distinct complication or twist, reading as a linear execution of a plan.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks a causal arc or a genuine scene, functioning instead as a linear sequence of events without obstacles. There is no on-page closure with cost; the ending is a repetitive continuation of the beginning ("she continued her work") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest ("go here, find this") lacking causal complexity or meaningful setbacks. Closure is a total victory without the required felt or conceptual cost; obstacles vanish "instantly" or "without hesitation."

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative fails the Orientation Test, placing the reader in a metaphorical "sanctuary" that lacks concrete physical grounding or established reality rules, resulting in "white-room syndrome" dressed in adjectives. The plot follows a dream-logic sequence where actions (opening a door) have only symbolic causality, lacking a tangible inciting incident or stakes. The closure is a thematic summary rather than a dramatic resolution with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and relies on "dream logic" where concepts become physical without established rules or friction, leading to a wish-fulfillment ending. While a Decisive Change occurs (bolt to diamond), the lack of obstacles or a "try/fail" cycle makes the resolution feel inevitable and unearned. The "multiverse texts" function as a deus ex machina to guide the protagonist without requiring him to deduce or risk anything on his own.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a "magic box" causality: the protagonist desires truth, turns a crank, and the machine delivers it via "standing waves." There is no complication, obstacle, or active deduction. The closure ("seeking redemption") is a stated intention ("scoot ending") rather than a dramatized shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot is a linear progression of unhindered success; the protagonist faces no causal obstacles and succeeds because the ritual demands it. Closure fails the cost requirement, offering "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved purely by requesting it, devoid of trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on summary rather than dramatized scene, compressing research and discovery into a linear list of successes without causal friction. The timeline is vague, and the resolution is earned through off-page "further research" rather than a decisive moment of change or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient tools (the map, the key) without cost. The ending dissolves into a broad summary of success ("In the following days...") rather than a distinct on-page closure unit (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration). Causality is weak; events happen sequentially but lack a "because/therefore" tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is coherent and linear, fulfilling the ritual arc, but lacks causal tension or meaningful reversals. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned, as the "negative space" method solves the problem without complication or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where prophecy dictates events rather than character causality. There is no resistance or complication; the discovery of the speck leads instantly to success without setbacks. The closure offers a "thriving future" summary that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, relying on a repetitive "emerged transformed always" tag that fails to land as a genuine reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure relies entirely on convenient coincidence (finding a key in a greenhouse that fits a box in a distant cave) rather than causal progression. The plot moves through "and then" sequencing without rising pressure or logical necessity. Closure is achieved through a summary of realization rather than a decisive, earned change in stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story executes a clean Conceptual Repricing arc, moving from a failed search to a redefined purpose with legible causality. The breaking of the coin serves as a decisive turning point that anchors the closure. The pacing is efficient, though the inciting failure is backstory; the on-page arc is tight and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causality born of resistance; the soul is healed simply because Elara requests it. Closure occurs without a felt or conceptual cost, failing the core requirement for a decisive change. The sequence is "and then" rather than "because/therefore."

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a coincidence (finding the strap "half-buried") to trigger the resolution, lacking a causal chain derived from the protagonist's agency. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, but it feels unearned because the catalyst is a lucky find rather than the result of the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative is strictly linear and lacks a decisive change with felt cost; the resolution is achieved through a "mental push" that dissolves the obstacle without complication. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the task is simply done—rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" sequencing, culminating in a summarized climax ("spent hours there... piecing together") that dissolves scene tension. Closure is achieved through a soft reset—a promise to a museum—without a felt cost or high-stakes choice. The resolution feels unearned because the pivotal interaction is narrated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.3)
    The piece reads more like a synopsis or fable summary than a dramatized story, relying on "and then" sequencing without scene-level pressure. While a causal chain exists, the closure—a conceptual acceptance of instability—lacks a visceral, felt cost on the page because the rupture is described from a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("The archaeological dispute intensified," "She executed her plan") rather than dramatized scenes. The climax—an experiment that succeeds immediately and perfectly—lacks friction or the possibility of failure. Closure offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist is fully vindicated without paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a contrived encounter with a "townsman" solely to demonstrate the "wilting" mechanic, which is resolved instantly by a simple request for truth. The global resolution (restoring the world's light) is unearned, achieved through a montage of "mending" without visible cost or complication. The pacing is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative lacks causal friction or meaningful obstacles; the descent is smoothed over by the compass's convenient pulsing. The closure—leaving the compass—is a symbolic gesture that feels disconnected from a legible, hard-won realization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: problem (GPS fail) -> magical solution (slide) -> epiphany -> problem fixed (GPS returns). The resolution relies on "Symmetric Satisfaction" (the storm abates because she made art) and a "Soft Reset" of the technology, lacking a felt cost or causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe orientation and timeline failure: the story begins in autumn, flashes back to winter, moves forward to "spring's first buds" during the painting phase, then inexplicably returns to "autumn light" at the climax. Causality is weak; the epiphany (looking at glass solves a biological question) is unearned by the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the "trap" functions merely as a viewing mechanism with no failure condition or urgency. The resolution—deciding to publish—is a standard declaration of intent rather than a structural turn earned by the scene's pressure. The "decoding" mechanism relies on dream logic that lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story violates the short-story scope by presenting a synopsis of a civilization's revival rather than a dramatized scene. Causality is summarized ("he conceived a plan... the ghost town's revival was slow") rather than experienced. There is no immediate scene-level closure, only a chronicled resolution of a long timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of his role from archivist to prophet) is distinct. However, the plot relies heavily on a linear progression of events where the central turning point (the accidental recording) is a coincidence that happens to him, limiting the sense of earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks tension; the central problem (unstable egg) is introduced and immediately resolved by a pre-possessed tool (acorn cap) without complication. The causal chain is mechanical, moving from setup to resolution without a testing phase or a "try/fail" cycle to earn the climax. Orientation is sufficient, but the "and then" progression deflates dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the solution (the bell) works instantly and perfectly without complication. The logic that a "gentle sound" would be more effective than a siren in a storm lacks verisimilitude, and the resolution offers a tidy, unearned symmetry with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or a decisive change; it functions as a static vignette of reflection rather than a story with a beginning, middle, and end. The closure is a conceptual "soft reset" where the protagonist simply realizes he is happy/strong without paying a visible cost or facing an obstacle. Orientation is vague, with the "overlooked era" functioning as a backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on convenience and magical thinking rather than causality; the protagonist solves the central conflict simply by opening a box, with no established logic or difficulty. The plot advances through summary explanations ("pieced together their purpose") rather than action, and the resolution lacks a legible cost or trade-off. The drive lens is nominally causal but broken by the "magic fix" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary and exposition ("One day," "One afternoon," "In the days that followed") rather than dramatized scenes. The resolution hinges on a coincidence—the stranger arriving at the right moment—rather than protagonist agency. The closure is a "happy ever after" tableau with no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal pressure; the inciting incident (snapped string) resolves instantly via a speech without complication or cost. Closure relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the child is healed and the poet inspired, lacking the required felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story violates the short story scope by summarizing six months of action ("Days turned into weeks") rather than dramatizing a specific, pivotal scene. This results in a synopsis-like structure where events happen because the author says so, not due to causal pressure. The ending lacks a dramatic turn or felt cost, offering only a summary of success.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural path: arrival, experiment, success. The "artificial pilgrimage" logic is blurred—it is unclear if the setting is a physical reality or a VR construct, especially given the "rainwashed" versus "dusty footprints" contradiction. Closure relies on a tidy, victorious realization (Conceptual Repricing) that lacks the necessary on-page cost or obstacle to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear procedural checklist (arrive, listen, plant, leave) lacking causal turns or complications. The closure is merely the cessation of the task, with no "felt or conceptual cost" other than the depletion of supplies. The structure lacks tension or meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is legible as a Decisive Change (leaving the sanctuary), but the climax hinges on a fragile causal leap where a leaf’s vein pattern serendipitously decodes an audio track. This "poetic logic" bypasses mechanical plausibility and feels like a convenient shortcut to solve the riddle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks causal density; the decision to leave feels like a leap of logic rather than a necessary consequence of the star's appearance. The closure is a decisive change, but the "shutdown" context is too vague to establish the cost of leaving his post. The orientation relies on told descriptors like "temporally stretched" rather than grounded mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, episodic checklist (climb, meet, swap, fix) without causal friction or meaningful reversals. The resolution relies on a convenient ritual that succeeds instantly; the closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost," resulting in a tidy, frictionless win.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression of successful symbolic acts without resistance or causal setbacks; the protagonist spells words, and the environment simply complies. Closure is a "soft reset," offering emotional relief and thematic summary without an earned, irreversible change or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on synopsis-style telling ("After weeks of effort") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. Closure is achieved through a thematic realization statement rather than a decisive action or image with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak, relying on an unexplained link between the village tapestry and the king's labyrinth ("somehow tied") to solve the plot. The resolution comes via a convenient epiphany ("suddenly a new pattern emerged") rather than an earned breakthrough, and there is no visible cost to the success.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible Conceptual Repricing at the closure, where the crowd's understanding shifts. However, the progression meets virtually no resistance; the environment and the "judge" remain passive, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story ends in "Symmetric Satisfaction," granting a total victory ("mended and whole") with no lingering cost or trade-off. The narrative arc is linear and predictable, lacking a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change that alters the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot hinges on a significant causality break: the protagonist discovers a cave via a "wrong turn" into a thicket she "never noticed," yet finds a shell she personally placed there years ago, contradicting the idea that the location was unknown to her. The resolution is an unearned "soft reset" where a lifetime of nostalgia evaporates instantly upon finding the object, lacking visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot relies on a "wish fulfillment" structure where the protagonist's action yields an immediate, verified result without obstacle or cost. The mid-scene POV shift to the brother deflates the tension by confirming success instantly, removing the ambiguity essential to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "instruction-fulfillment" structure with no obstacles or causal setbacks to test the goal. The resolution ("the voice had been her own all along") is a clichéd conceptual unmasking that dissolves the narrative tension rather than resolving it through dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the closure relies on a "magic fix" without a visible on-page cost ("cost of its power remained unknown"). The resolution feels like a convenience rather than a hard-won reconfiguration of the character's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing a weeks-long investigation ("spent days walking," "One night") rather than dramatizing a specific scene. Causality breaks when Elias receives a supernatural "fragment of memory" to solve the mystery, which contradicts the established realistic tone. The resolution depends on mailing a letter to a woman whose name and address were previously implied to be missing ("missing names"), creating a significant logic gap.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands with a legible cost (Mara remains lost), but the plot relies on the coincidence of ants leading to the goal rather than causal agency. The "rising creek" adds effective pressure, but the bridge from shop to cavern lacks logical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative suffers from a "show-and-tell" failure where a disembodied voice explains the plot and theme at the climax. Causality is weak; the encounter with the silent guardian is disconnected filler that does not alter the protagonist's trajectory or knowledge. The ending resolves through passive acceptance of information rather than active problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a philosophical realization instantly resolves a physical problem without material cost, functioning as a "soft reset." The orientation is vague; the nature of the "ember nexus" and the stakes of its "dying" remain abstract. Closure is achieved through a change in mindset rather than a decisive action with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, and the closure—finishing the scroll to achieve a Resonant Reconfiguration—lands with valid conceptual cost. The transition into the "soaring" vision feels slightly abrupt, functioning more as a convenient set-piece than a strictly causal development.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: problem stated → mentor provides solution → problem solved. There is no causal struggle or cost; the resolution is handed to the protagonist in a monologue. The shift to a summary montage ("One woman... came seeking solace") diffuses the scene's tension and bypasses the actual work of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of prompt requirements without generating causal momentum or genuine risk. The resolution (finding calm) is achieved through a soft internal pivot ("revisited her youthful belief") with no tangible cost or sacrifice. The logic of "speaking aloud" while "during this held breath" creates a confusing physical contradiction that breaks the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative moves linearly from setup to resolution without a causal turn or complication to test the protagonist's plan. While closure is legible, the sequence relies on a mechanical "and then" progression where the device and perfume work instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal friction; actions lead to success simply because they happen. The closure ("illusions began to dissolve") is a soft reset achieved without visible cost or ingenuity, relying on magical convenience. The plot feels like a checklist of required actions rather than an organic story.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence (action, thought, realization) where the epiphany is unearned by the preceding events; looking at a gear causes a total philosophical conceptual repricing without sufficient causal groundwork. The structural use of "After blowing the whistle" as a repeated refrain creates a timeline stutter rather than causal progression, and the ending explains the theme explicitly ("metaphors for our own sharp boundaries") rather than letting it land via action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magic wand" resolution where a security system update instantaneously solves a metaphysical problem. Causality breaks at the climax: adjusting a laser frequency to "harmonize" with an intruder provides a convenient, explanation-free fix. The ending is a symmetrical, frictionless victory that lacks the required cost for a 600–800 word story.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on "magical" coincidence (a subway scrawl pointing specifically to a library) and a convenient discovery (her father's personal journal in public stacks) to drive the narrative. These contrivances break causality, and the closure arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than a consequence of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on a linear problem-solution structure where the central conflict is resolved by a magical object ("glass disc") rather than earned agency. The climax ("she noticed the small joys") occurs in summary rather than dramatization, and the closure lacks the requisite "visible or felt cost" demanded by the rubric, reading as a tidy transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural structure where the protagonist performs a ritual without obstacle or risk of failure. Closure relies on a convenient redefinition of success ("saved... from being forgotten") that dissolves the conflict without cost. The inciting incident (demolition vote) is summarized backstory rather than a pressure point in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and exposition to bridge the central conflict, particularly in the "Weeks later" conclusion which tells the reader the plan worked rather than showing the immediate cost. The linear progression lacks a decisive on-page turning point, as Leo's skepticism melts instantly upon hearing Elara's speech. The drive lens is muddled by the shift from scene to broad summary at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear progression (follow notes -> find tree -> find gully) lacking causal complications or setbacks. The closure relies on a "soft reset" where the environment resolves the conflict for her ("let the hidden melody... tune her sorrow"), lacking a decisive change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The crucial mechanism of victory—the network of "contingent relationships"—is handled in summary ("replies trickled in"), sapping the climax of causal immediacy. The resolution is too tidy; the anomaly stabilizes instantly upon the first attempt at contact without exacting a visible price or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    The structure is legible and achieves a form of Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression is linear and lacks causal friction. The plot relies on a "lesson" structure where the protagonist succeeds at the central task immediately upon trying, removing tension. The ending lands a conceptual shift, but the lack of obstacles makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene scope with a summary montage ("For days, he worked tirelessly") that deflates tension. Puzzles are solved instantly via convenient intuition ("realized that the portrait was a map") rather than causal logic or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story functions as a synopsis or iterative summary ("Each evening," "At the next cosmic inhalation") rather than a specific, causal scene. The climax is an asserted event ("The garden erupted") without a clear causal chain of overcoming resistance, and the closure ("became a catalyst") is unearned by the preceding summary. The timeline drifts between habitual action and singular moments, preventing narrative traction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality relies on dream logic rather than grounded mechanics; the zodiac coin functioning as security authorization is unexplained and convenient. The resolution—whispering directions to workers in a storm—feels magical rather than practical. The "key as metaphor" moment breaks narrative immersion to explain the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks a decisive turn or causal pressure; the protagonist sets out to do a task and succeeds without complication. Closure arrives via a "magical fix" where the child's spirit is soothed, but there is no felt cost or trade-off to validate the resolution. The "half-spoken secret" remains a vague framing device rather than a structural driver.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("continued monthly," "years later") rather than a dramatized scene with a specific turning point. Closure is a generalized summary of success ("forests grew") rather than a concrete event with on-page cost, failing the single-scene/two-shard scope default.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory with no meaningful obstacles; the inciting incident (the call) leads directly to resolution without a testing of commitment. The closure is a "Decisive Change" (departure), but the lack of resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned. The magical resolution bypasses the need for a tactical climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no causal progression or escalation; the ending merely restates the opening condition (whittling) without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The lack of a specific, immediate inciting incident leaves the story in a state of unearned stasis from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction sequence ("He approached... He placed... He began") where actions yield immediate, unqualified success. Closure is a conceptual realization ("beauty lies... in change") that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no meaningful resistance or cost. The "ban" is already lifted, removing the primary source of potential external causality/pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where the climax—the painting challenge—is resolved through summary ("Slowly, he felt an inner shift") rather than a specific, high-pressure beat. The closure lands on a conceptual realization, but the lack of on-page obstacles or genuine risk makes the "bartered transformation" feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a legible causal arc: method, failure, pivot, and success. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the laboratory transforms. However, the solution—simply turning the lens around—feels convenient and lacks a commensurate cost or complication to earn the breakthrough. The "pilgrimage" is described but the struggle is largely ellided.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure that summarizes the pivotal transformation instead of dramatizing a specific moment of change with cost. The ending with the visitor merely illustrates a status quo already established by the prior summary, lacking a decisive on-page turn or causal pressure. The "scavenger hunt" plot progresses linearly without obstacles, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a static loop of exposition with no decisive change or inciting incident to disrupt the status quo. The ending offers a conceptual summary rather than a structural closure with visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension execution of a ritual where the primary obstacle ("steadily unpredictable" atoms) is immediately resolved by a pre-planned method ("random movements"). The closure is a standard success state without a decisive turn or complication that forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from observation to intervention and consequence. However, the mechanism of resolution is vague; the library "seemed to respond" to her will, bypassing specific causal difficulty or tactical complexity. Closure lands with a clear conceptual price (safety over truth), satisfying the requirement, but the path there lacks resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a coherent internal arc under an Accumulative lens, moving from shock to resolution via the "shedding" motif. However, the progression is linear and low-resistance; the protagonist solves her internal crisis with a checklist-like efficiency that reduces narrative tension and makes the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative progression relies on dream logic—reading coffee rings leads immediately to a decision to tunnel—which strains causality. While the story achieves a formal closure with the hourglass restarting, the resolution comes too easily via a magical object that explains everything, bypassing the need for a decisive, costly action from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: observe, touch, see, resolve. The transition to the "nebulous realm" solves the central inquiry without causal friction or setback, and the ending feels like a soft reset where a "new purpose" is granted without a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" epiphany ("In that moment, she realized...") that resolves the central conflict without earned causality or cost. The structure is a linear summary of events rather than a scene with tension; the resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem simply dissolves upon realization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "list of tasks" structure where obstacles are overcome immediately by the protagonist's abilities without complication. Closure fails the cost requirement; the ending offers symmetric satisfaction (world renewed, internal peace achieved) without a "felt cost" or trade-off to ground the change. The "wave function" mechanic functions as a magic wand that dissolves logical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina (translocation) to skip the middle conflict and deposit the protagonist at the climax. The resolution is mechanically symmetric ("gear fit perfectly"), lacking any "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" required for genuine closure. The "explain-everything ending" resolves the mystery without earning the insight through on-page causality or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (walk, get stamped, arrive) lacking causal friction or genuine obstacles. The closure relies on a "Ruby Slippers" realization—that the goal was internal all along—which is unearned by any on-page struggle or cost. The transition from "broken leash" to "ferry guides" is smooth but lacks narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative momentum collapses mid-story when the investigation shifts into broad summary ("He began to spend his free hours in the archives"), violating the short-story default of continuous scene. This choice bypasses the actual conflict of discovery, reducing the climax to a reported realization rather than an experienced event. The causal link between fixing the bench and finding the specific history in the ledgers feels tenuous and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative breaks the short story form with a massive summary bridge ("Years blended into moments... One day"), reducing the conflict to a synopsis. The resolution is a deus ex machina where a magical rune instantly dissolves the antagonist, bypassing causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a linear accumulation of data, but the climax relies on a summarized "delayed revelation" rather than a dramatized turning point. Closure is achieved through a "happy ending" realization that dissolves the tension without any visible or felt cost, failing to meet the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure collapses into a Deus Ex Machina; the stone circle appears late to conveniently solve the central conflict (the lull) without requiring a sacrifice or clever tactic from the protagonist. The ending is an &quot;explain-everything&quot; soft reset where a magical wave fixes the rebellion instantly, lacking any felt cost or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("spent days cross-referencing," "In the years that followed") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope default for a short story. The closure is a "happy-ever-after" synopsis that resolves societal issues without visible cost or sacrifice, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where a trigger occurs and is immediately resolved by the protagonist's pre-existing competence ("she had the tools"). The resolution feels like a "soft reset" because the crisis (the aircraft hum) is managed through internal monologue and summary rather than a difficult choice or action with consequences. The ending is a return to status quo (grafting) without a palpable shift in the story's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a reflection-led structure that far exceeds the scope allowance, dissolving immediate scene pressure into a linear list of summarized memories. The closure functions as a "soft reset," where the character resolves a lifetime of trauma through a momentary realization without a visible causal trigger or paid price. The trajectory is predictable and lacks the resistance required for a genuine arc.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure with no resistance or complications; the experiment works perfectly on the first attempt. Closure relies on an "explain-everything" summary ("He had his answer...") rather than a dramatized change with a felt cost. The logic of the ink creating a time void is asserted rather than earned through the story's internal causality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative reads like a summary rather than a dramatized scene, moving linearly from setup to resolution without significant obstacles. The climax relies on convenience—alarms failing to sound and an instant, telepathic-like global reaction—which dissolves tension and renders the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative is a summary of a condition followed by a low-stakes encounter, lacking a scenic arc or decisive change. Causality is abstract and magical (placing a scrap makes plants robust) rather than logical or character-driven. The ending affirms the status quo without a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path from entry to success with clear causality, but the progression lacks significant complications or twists. The closure (restoring balance) is legible but arrives without a sense of risk or sacrifice, as the obstacles are overcome quickly using the established tool. The "unraveling reality" stakes remain abstract and do not pressure the structural logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central investigation relies on a significant convenience: pulling a file "at random" that immediately contains the smoking gun short-circuits the causal chain. This lucky break resolves the mystery without requiring the protagonist to exercise agency or skill, undermining the "proof by contradiction" framework.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where "tattooing soundboards" fixes "firmware" and a letter sent back in time resolves trauma, lacking concrete causality. The closure is a "soft reset" that erases the conflict's weight without an earned, logical progression or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where a magical object and a drawing instantly cure complex existential dread. The ending explains the solution ("The mess was not something to be cleaned") rather than earning it through causality, rendering the closure unearned and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where touching a stone conveniently reveals a "map of states of being," instantly solving the central conflict without established causality. The closure is a soft reset; the protagonist renames herself and the universe immediately grants "aberrant mercy" without exacting a visible cost or requiring a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear "attempt–success" path where the protagonist performs a ritual that works exactly as intended without meaningful complication or cost. The mention that the "fractured timeline resisted" is a told abstraction that disappears immediately when she simply sings harder, lacking the specific tactical adjustment required for a causal drive lens. Closure is achieved, but it feels unearned because the mechanism is an "explain-everything" magic coin rather than a decisive action with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a convenient "happy path" where a random catalyst ("static shock") resolves the internal obstacle and a summary action ("devised a method") resolves the external one. Causality is weak; the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without complication, trial, or failure. The closure is tidy and unearned, lacking the "decisive change" or "felt cost" required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence where every action succeeds immediately without obstacle or complication. Closure is an unearned "level up" (floating) with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of success without setbacks; the protagonist attempts the ritual and succeeds immediately. While the closure (the prophecy changing) is clear, it lacks a "cost proof"—the change feels like a magic-button solution rather than an earned outcome derived from struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.2)
    The central plot device—codes laid in snow "before the freeze" remaining legible on a windy bluff—breaks physical plausibility and undermines causality. The arrival of enemy agents is a convenient escalation without setup, and the closure ("mission accomplished") is a standard trope that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is a static vignette of waiting, lacking active causality; the protagonist essentially sits and thinks until an external timer (the ticking) expires. Closure is a "soft reset" where the cessation of rain arbitrarily triggers a life-altering epiphany without earned narrative logic or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative arc is flat; the protagonist arrives, observes, and receives an answer without facing obstacles or paying a price. The resolution relies on a "ghostly vision" that functions as a Deus Ex Machina to explain the theme. There is no legible cost or decisive change in the protagonist's status or tactics, only an internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of ritualistic actions lacking causal tension or necessary obstacles. The ending ("promise of renewal") feels like a symmetric satisfaction trope rather than a consequence of the protagonist's specific agency. Closure is soft and low-cost, resetting the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.1)
    The plot follows a flat "and-then" sequence where a problem is introduced and immediately solved by a magical device without complication or cost. The orientation is functional, but the causality is weak because there is no obstacle to the solution; she simply walks to the circle, and it fixes her trauma. Closure is unearned, relying on a "magic button" resolution rather than a decisive change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: intention leads immediately to execution without obstacle or cost. The community’s instant, poetic compliance removes any potential friction from the public art plotline. Closure lands on a realization ("vulnerability") that feels unearned by the struggle on the page, lacking a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution lacks a felt cost. The immediate success of the unproven method and the antagonist's instant forgiveness create a "no-consequence" ending that deflates the setup. The closure relies on a convenient double-victory (signal stops, boss approves) rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully realized story, lacking scenic density and causal friction. The resolution is an "explain-everything" ending where a keeper explicitly delivers the solution, dissolving tension without protagonist agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers from a "Sherlock Scan" failure where the protagonist divines the entire truth (accident vs. murder, specific emotional states) from insufficient evidence. The closure relies on a massive leap of logic that feels like magical intuition rather than a causal result of the investigation, breaking the "because/therefore" chain required for a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis rather than a story, compressing weeks of events into summary statements ("She discovered," "She coordinated") without scene-level causality. The plot hinges on massive conveniences, such as immediately finding a centuries-old copper nail on an exposed wooden plank.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure suffers from a "soft reset" ending where a magical realization instantly resolves the central mystery without causal groundwork. The connection between the "scaffold wrap flutters" and the solution is asserted rather than shown, breaking narrative logic. The story essentially pauses to explain its own resolution through internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from low causality and an unearned resolution; the central conflict dissolves instantly upon Leo's speech, lacking necessary friction or complication. Closure is asserted via summary ("cycle was broken") rather than achieved through a decisive action or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a convenient epiphany ("When understanding dawned, it was sudden") to resolve the plot instantly; the closure is a "happy path" victory that lacks the required visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (problem, search, find key, use key, fix problem) without meaningful complication or cost. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the curse simply dissipates because the ritual was performed correctly; the protagonist sacrifices nothing and faces no genuine dilemma. The logic of the magic (seed unbends ice) feels arbitrary and convenient rather than rooted in established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where abstract actions ("trace patterns," "focus") yield massive physical results without established causality. The inciting incident ("future arrived early") and the stakes ("eclipsed covenant") remain vague concepts that do not generate concrete obstacles on the page. The closure—a portal opening because she "heeded" a call—feels unearned, lacking a specific, logical cost beyond the performative bloodletting.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "soft reset" resolution where a single piece of advice immediately solves the protagonist's lifelong existential crisis without cost. While the scene is oriented correctly, the causality is weak; the protagonist succeeds not through trial and error or sacrifice, but by simply agreeing with a secondary character. The closure feels unearned, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending where a sudden epiphany ("Then, an idea sparked") resolves the central conflict without cost. The transition to a summary montage ("He spent the next days...") dissipates the scene's tension and bypasses the necessary dramatization of change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path but suffers from a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved intellectually without sacrifice. The closure—fixing the arbor—lacks a visible price; the transition from confusion to mastery is smoothed over by the sudden efficacy of "analogical thinking."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc; events occur sequentially (he smelts one, then another, then stops) without rising pressure or necessary linkage. The ending is a soft reset that returns to status quo ("the cycle awaited its next turn") without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression with no causal crunch; events happen sequentially without forcing the protagonist into a corner. The resolution relies on a magical deus ex machina (the light) to solve the internal problem, resulting in a soft reset where the character changes his life path without paying any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks causal tension; the climax relies on a "magic words" epiphany (graffiti) that instantly resolves deep trauma without a trade-off. The inciting incident (stopping medication) is backstory that fails to generate on-page obstacles or meaningful instability.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful steps with no causal friction or setbacks; obstacles are solved immediately by "documenting." The ending lacks a decisive change or paid cost, resulting in a "success" that feels unearned and mechanical. The causality of how writing in a journal aids physical navigation is asserted but not established logically.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path to a decisive closure, but the pivot relies on a convenient divination mechanism (coffee stains) that acts as an instruction manual for the violin, bypassing the protagonist's established expertise. The connection between the violin’s mechanics and the "coffee map" is weak logic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without a decisive turning point or causal tightening; the outcome is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved exactly as planned. The ending lacks closure cost, as the success is total and unblemished. Orientation is clear, but the plot lacks the friction required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative structure is a sequence of prompt-driven actions without causal pressure or meaningful obstacles. The resolution relies on a *deus ex machina* (the hairpin glowing and whispering) to deliver an unearned epiphany. Causality is broken by this magical intervention which solves the internal problem instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear healing-session structure where magical props resolve the conflict without complication or sacrifice. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," lacking the felt cost or decisive change required for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks dramatic causality; the "delayed revelation" is an instructional tactic rather than a plot driver. The resolution feels unearned, as the protagonist achieves the goal simply by following directions without facing a significant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unobstructed success: Elara wants X, sees birds, does X, and succeeds. There is no causal friction or cost; the solution (humming a tone) resolves the central problem instantly. The closure is a summary of success ("finding itself") rather than a decisive change paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and "and-then" sequencing (e.g., "The journey was treacherous") rather than dramatized scenes. The resolution operates as a "soft reset" where magic fixes all issues instantly without causal struggle, failing the requirement for earned closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear fetch-quest without obstacle, reversal, or cost; access to the wreck and library is impossibly convenient. Closure is unearned because the protagonist pays no price—physical, emotional, or opportunity—for the revelation, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative structure resembles a synopsis rather than a fully realized scene, moving linearly from action to epiphany without causal resistance. The climax relies on an unearned realization ("In a moment of clarity, she understood") rather than a decision made under pressure with visible cost. The ending explains the meaning of the prophecy rather than dramatizing the consequence of the alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path where intent immediately leads to success without significant friction or cost. The magic system is convenient—willing the light to "crystallize" memory works perfectly on the first try—making the resolution feel unearned and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "try and succeed" path with no meaningful obstacles or causal turns; a cut finger and fatigue are trivial inconveniences. The resolution is an unearned "explain-everything" ending where the established limitation (lukewarm power) is simply ignored to allow a perfect fix without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.5)
    The piece reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized story, violating the single-scene scope by summarizing weeks of "healing" and "festivals" in the final paragraphs. The "trail of photographs" functions as a convenient plot device (video-game logic) that removes causal friction, and the resolution arrives without obstacle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks genuine causality; the resolution arrives via a convenient external metaphor (the starlings) rather than earned struggle. The ending is a soft reset that declares "wholeness" without a felt price or consequence. The story functions more as a prologue/setup than a complete narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path, but the causality is weak; tightening a physical buckle to solve a data algorithm issue strains credibility. The closure is a "soft reset" (the danger was just a celestial event), offering satisfaction without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.6)
    The resolution is unearned, relying on a magical "fix-it" ritual that instantly solves the central conflict and stabilizes the world without visible cost or sacrifice. The causality is weak, as the opposing factions simply accept Kael's proposal without resistance, dissolving the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative structure relies on summary ("In the days that followed") to deliver the resolution, violating the requirement for on-page dramatization. The story lacks a causal arc with genuine pressure; it is essentially an extended brainstorming session that transitions into a summary of success without a distinct closure event or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative is coherent and follows a clear cause-and-effect line, but the structure is strictly linear without significant reversals or beats of doubt. The closure lands as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression—start machine, increase volume, achieve result—lacks the friction or complication required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot lacks causal progression, consisting of static waiting followed by an unearned epiphany where the pendant conveniently becomes a key. The ending utilizes a "soft reset" where boundaries dissolve into a "seamless whole," evading the cost and consequence required for genuine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a linear, summary-heavy structure where the climax is resolved by a sudden internal realization ("flash of insight") rather than earned causality. The closure is overly tidy; the "destruction" immediately yields a perfect result without any visible cost or trade-off, neutralizing the stakes. The pacing feels like a fable or outline rather than a fully realized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: obstacle encountered, item used, problem solved. Closure lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; the ending is a purely positive epiphany that resolves the premise without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story suffers from the "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern; the ferry is restored perfectly without any felt cost or sacrifice. The resolution relies on convenient "magic" (aligning patterns) that lacks causal weight or logical grounding. The ending is too tidy, bypassing the necessary struggle to earn such a complete victory.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative arc relies on abstract occurrences ("tapestry... began to erupt") rather than distinct protagonist-driven causality; the resolution is an internal shift in perspective without a visible, concrete cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension teaching vignette structure where the inciting problem (student boredom) is resolved by a single pedagogical adjustment without complication. While the closure lands a legible Conceptual Repricing (the ocean as launchpad), the lack of prior obstacles or cost makes the resolution feel tidy and inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure lacks a dramatized climax; the pivotal moment—Eleanor’s story—is summarized ("her story unfolding") rather than shown. Events proceed via linear convenience ("The mist seemed to part then") without causal friction or obstacle. The ending offers a soft release without the required "felt cost" or decisive change in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest (reverse-fetch) with low causal density; obstacles are overcome immediately with the tool provided. The ending provides a "mission accomplished" closure with sentimental supernatural affirmation (smiling ghosts) rather than a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where trauma is resolved instantly by looking at ink, lacking a felt cost or logical mechanism. The causal link between "defragmenting data" and "spilled ink" is asserted rather than established, breaking narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where the inciting method (bird patterns) creates the solution for the climax (mimicry). The closure lands as a distinct tactical reconfiguration (imposing will vs. harmonizing) with clear conceptual cost. The progression is logical and the setup pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure where the protagonist simply enacts a plan without obstacle or reversal. The resolution is unearned, relying on the magical efficacy of the tools (arrowhead, phone) rather than causal logic or ingenuity. Closure is a "soft reset" where bitterness dissolves into joy without a visible cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot functions mechanically but lacks earned causality; the solution arrives via convenient memory ("recalled legends") rather than active discovery or struggle. The climax resolves instantly upon playing the violin, bypassing any meaningful resistance or trade-off. The narrative arc feels like a checklist execution rather than a causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (wait, load, watch) devoid of complication, obstacle, or causality; the plan works exactly as intended. Closure is unearned, resting on a stated realization ("sensed a shift") rather than a consequence of the protagonist's choices or a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.7)
    The arc is strictly linear with no causal setbacks or complications; the "wrong turn" is a convenient inciting incident that leads directly to a solution. Closure arrives via a magical fix (singing activates the carousel) rather than a decision that carries a visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.6)
    The structure is a linear progression of "desire, action, success" with no meaningful obstacles or causal complications. The ending acts as a soft reset where the protagonist immediately returns to duties, undermining the magnitude of the trans-dimensional discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot follows a linear checklist (setup, action, success) to a "soft reset" closure where the central conflict evaporates instantly. The ending lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for a high-band score; the resolution is tidy and symmetrical ("dream was finally at rest, and so was she") rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, video-game-quest logic (wait for hint → get hint → use key → win) that lacks genuine causal friction or unexpected consequences. The closure is complete but feels unearned because the "struggle" is abstract ("time itself stuttered") and resolved by "holding fast" rather than a clever tactical pivot or sacrifice. The ending relies on an "explain-everything" summary of the thematic victory rather than a dramatized shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem leads to magic solution" path without meaningful resistance or reversal. The closure acts as a symmetric reset—memories are returned simply because the ritual was performed—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost for a high-band score. The backstory is delivered via a convenient vision that explains the plot rather than complicating the present.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands clearly via a Conceptual Repricing where perception alters reality, but the causal mechanism (tea leaf geometry mapping a path) is abstract and soft. The resolution comes without a significant complication or failure, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a soft reset ending where magic instantly resolves the conflict without a felt cost. The "gray malaise" offers no active resistance or causal complications, resulting in a lack of tension. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc with no meaningful causal turns; the "slip" of the needle offers momentary friction but no lasting consequence. Closure is achieved through the mechanical finishing of the chore rather than a Decisive Change or felt cost. The ending resolves into symmetric satisfaction without narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot is linear and functional but lacks causal friction; the central puzzle dissolves immediately upon inspection of the footage, offering no resistance. The logic regarding the entrance (ivy-obscured in the past vs. fissure widening now) is slightly muddled, and the "perfect" resolution feels unearned by the low-pressure setup.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience, with a "miraculously intact" speaker and a legible vellum note providing an explain-everything ending that dissolves tension without earned cost. The narrative drive is linear and low-pressure, solving the central mystery through passive reading rather than active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of success with no obstacles or causal density; Elara attempts the task and immediately succeeds without complication. The closure—finding her voice—feels unearned because there was no risk of failure and no price paid for the victory. The "ghost" functions as a deus ex machina that resolves the tension simply by appearing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot relies heavily on the coincidental discovery of the diary and proceeds linearly without causal pressure. The narrative is a low-stakes progression of information gathering that lacks a decisive turning point or necessary sacrifice. The closure is a "gift" realization—insight gained without a dramatized price—which undermines the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure without causality or resistance; the protagonist observes, labels, and feels better. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is declared and immediately achieved without obstacle or cost. The survival stakes of a broken gondola are ignored in favor of abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the resolution of the primary obstacle relies on the protagonist conveniently having the exact key (the coin) in her pocket, which undercuts the tension. The closure lands well conceptually, but the mechanism to get there feels unearned due to this reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    The resolution hinges on an implausible coincidence—celestial coordinates hidden in a random deck hopscotch board—which shatters narrative logic and causality. The climax is unearned; the protagonist faces no obstacles, simply observing and solving the puzzle instantly without trial, error, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative proceeds via "video game logic" where the protagonist conveniently finds instructions (prophecy) and tools (gears) without causal resistance or setbacks. The closure relies on a "realization" beat that is found rather than earned, lacking a legible cost or decisive change in the protagonist’s status.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative operates as a summary of weeks rather than a dramatized scene, killing tension. The climax breaks causality; the bell—previously ineffective—works solely because the characters "trust" harder, a "care bear stare" mechanic with no established physical rules or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence of task completion without causal surprises or deepening complications. While the ending provides a soft sense of closure, it relies on a predetermined ritual rather than a decisive change driven by the protagonist's agency. The pacing is uniform, lacking a distinct climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "forgotten blueprint" functions as a convenient plot device that provides a complete instruction manual, bypassing the need for active problem-solving or discovery. The narrative relies on this backstory element to resolve the central technical challenge, reducing causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot hinges on a "lightbulb moment" where observing foam instantly resolves the central conflict of grief and scientific stagnation without causal friction or cost. The jump "days later" to success elides the actual struggle of application, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels like a soft reset. Closure is symmetric and tidy, lacking the requisite Decisive Change or Reconfiguration with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B structure with functional closure, but causality is weak; obstacles are introduced and immediately solved by the protagonist's inventory without friction. The ending acts as a soft reset where the protagonist changes her nature without a demonstrated struggle, resulting in low narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, mechanical path with no meaningful deviation or complication. The closure is achieved through simple persistence ("focused on subsume") without a decisive change in tactics or a felt cost, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal spine and genuine closure; the conflict is resolved through a "magic fix" where repairing a clock instantly heals deep social rifts without cost. The representatives' immediate, frictionless agreement bypasses necessary rising action, resulting in an unearned "happy ever after" that fails the requirement for a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless path of "and then" progression where success is inevitable and unearned. The "magic system" of modifying memories via a mirror lacks causal logic or limitations, functioning purely as a device to enable the desired ending. Closure is a classic "symmetric satisfaction" failure: the protagonist achieves exactly what she set out to do, with no twist, sacrifice, or conceptual reweighting to mark the change.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path (enter → use map → succeed) without a decisive causal turn or meaningful tightening. The resolution lacks a "Resonant Reconfiguration" or visible cost; the protagonist simply walks to the goal and claims the prize without a complicated trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression with a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is resolved perfectly without cost. The inciting incident relies on a tenuous symbolic link (the hedgehog uncurling) rather than causality, and the resolution (world singing again) feels unearned by the minimal effort shown. The drive lens is Accumulative but lacks the density or deepening required for a satisfying short story structure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution hinges on a Deus Ex Machina where the stone's dent fits a ridge "perfectly," bypassing any earned causal chain or cost. The narrative consists largely of static exposition followed by a single mechanical interaction that resolves a national crisis without difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear task-completion sequence (try device -> device works -> success) with no meaningful reversal or deepening. The urgency of the fireworks is declared but creates no causal complication or trade-off; the closure is a tidy, unearned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where external magic ("collective shift in thought") and an internal realization solve the physical problem. Causality is broken; the seed opens due to thematic convenience rather than the protagonist's active agency.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot moves linearly from A to B, but the discovery of the arrow feels coincidental ("glint among the roots") and the object functions as a convenient exposition device that downloads the answer. Closure is a net gain (knowledge obtained) without any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (survey -> find patch -> find crash -> understand) lacking a decisive change or meaningful complication. The closure is purely intellectual ("convergence understood") without a visible or felt cost to the protagonist, reading as a tidy summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of "and then" events without a causal turn or meaningful tightening of options. The climax relies on an unearned coincidence—the magical synchronization with a distant sculptor—rather than protagonist agency or logical consequence. There is no resistance or failure state; the ritual simply succeeds as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear progression of unhindered successes; Kael intends to do a thing, does it without resistance, and succeeds immediately. The ending is a "soft reset" where the protagonist is "remade" without paying a visible or felt price, failing the closure cost requirement. The narrative lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from methodical experimentation to a breaking point and final realization. The closure functions well as a Conceptual Repricing—she trades her prized disorientation for a "simple, stark truth." The causality holds, though the "cost" is more philosophical (loss of the quest's allure) than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is episodic and low-pressure, functioning as a delivery mechanism for the theme rather than a causal chain of events. Closure is achieved through a "gift" realization—Kaelen gains insight without paying a visible price or facing a setback—resulting in an unearned resolution that lacks the required cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality is functional but relies on a deus ex machina; the frost arbitrarily reveals a specific repressed memory to force the ending. Orientation is jarring; the juxtaposition of a mundane "old relic" car within a fantasy-coded "quartz arbor" lacks logical grounding or explanation, disrupting world consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    The causality of finding "jigsaw puzzle pieces" in a "rummage sale box" within a mythic bamboo forest is unexplained and breaks world logic. The ending shifts perspective to Liam without a section break, creating a structural fissure that weakens the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=2.7)
    The piece fails the scene-based scope default, functioning as a summary of a life rather than a dramatized narrative. There is no on-page closure unit with cost; events proceed linearly without causal friction or a defined inciting incident that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path from discovery to resolution, but the climax relies on a sudden external escalation ("a rift tore open") rather than a consequence of the protagonist's choices. The resolution is convenient—a vision that delivers the answer intact—rather than a puzzle solved through agency. Causality is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    Causality suffers from a significant logic gap: Elian prioritizes building a stone cairn on the beach while the primary light is out, undermining the urgency of the crisis. The fate of the current keeper is a loose thread that leaves the ending's stability in question (leaving the tower unmanned again).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without a decisive change or cost; the ending ("poised on the edge") is a non-closure state of waiting. The structure relies on repetitive assertions of purpose rather than causal turns or accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist attempts a ritual and succeeds immediately. The ending explains the mystery completely ("illuminated the truth") without a felt cost or a reconfiguring of the character's stance, resulting in a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the central problem vanishes via magic without a paid cost. The catalyst ("pin is heard") serves as an arbitrary, unearned trigger for the climax rather than a causal development.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot operates as a linear summary of success, lacking causal friction, setbacks, or a moment of genuine risk. The resolution is instantaneous and unearned, resolving the central problem without a distinct "because/therefore" chain or visible difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a "soft reset" pattern where deep-seated trauma is resolved by a single conversation without visible cost or sacrifice. The causality is weak; the resolution depends on a wise elder explaining the solution rather than the protagonist earning it through action. The ending feels unearned and pat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on the convenient discovery of a journal to resolve the central tension, undermining causality; the climax (shifting the stone) feels unearned given her long tenure in the garden. The "uncloaking" is a linear quest completion rather than a pressure-driven turn, and the resolution is found, not forged.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence of task completion without significant obstacles or causal turns. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction—the goal is stated and then fully met—lacking a decisive change or felt cost to the protagonist. The "escalation" is merely a quickening of pace, resulting in a low-stakes, predictable trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is complete, and the closure (capturing the sound) lands clearly, but the causal mechanism relies heavily on backstory summary ("false starts earlier"). The link between Elara's off-page tactics and Silas's on-page failure is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening the sense of inevitable result.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" ending where a secondary character delivers a monologue to resolve the mystery, stripping the protagonist of agency in the climax. The closure lacks a felt cost, offering a "symmetrical satisfaction" where the answer is simply handed over.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality breaks at the climax: the note provides the numbers, rendering the "mnemonic gift" logically redundant or confusing (she reads what she remembers?). The resolution is a "soft reset" where the central problem (creative block) vanishes without earned effort or cost, just by acquiring tools.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure resembles a synopsis or fable summary, relying on convenient backstory (finding the map) and montage travel ("moved through sectors") rather than dramatized scenes. A significant logic error occurs where the found items are described as "paper fragments" and immediately redefined as "zinc plates," disrupting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem-fix" trajectory where the resolution is achieved through competence ("focused intensity") rather than a costly choice or trade-off. The ending restores the status quo without a "Decisive Change" or felt cost, resulting in unearned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative reads as a summary or fable rather than a grounded scene, moving linearly from problem to solution without causal friction. While a closure unit (escape) occurs, it feels inevitable rather than earned, as the plot advances through convenient "decisions" and perfect execution rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is undermined by a significant logic break: the locket falls from a passing delivery truck yet is described as having been "lost in the move to his son's house," creating a confusing provenance that relies on massive coincidence. The resolution is too tidy ("symmetric satisfaction"), with the mailbox mystery solved instantly by a key conveniently found inside the locket, bypassing earned effort or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions with no causality or obstacles; the "magic" solution (dancing) resolves every lock without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction but lacks the required decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a linear fetch quest bridging the gap with convenient divination (coffee grounds); while closure is legible, the "soft reset" resolution—finding the jar and immediately feeling peace—lacks sufficient causal friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear checklist of successful actions without complication, lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The resolution is unearned and mechanical, treating the "prophecy" as a task to be completed rather than a pressure to be navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the student inherits the seal and the role. However, the inciting incident is summarized rather than dramatized, and the progression relies on a convenient lack of obstacles rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal resistance; the climax relies on a magical object to instantly resolve deep psychological trauma. This "soft reset" lacks the necessary resistance or complication to make the resolution earned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The causality is driven by abstract definitions rather than dramatic pressure; the resolution ("unlinking") happens simply because she wills it, lacking a visible cost or earned change in the scene's present action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a summary of events rather than a dramatized scene, lacking causal tension or concrete obstacles. The resolution is unearned, relying on a magical song that instantly solves the conflict without visible cost or complication, and the "progressive disclosure" is treated as a plot device rather than a structural element.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative is a synopsis spanning years and multiple locations, violating the short story scope of a continuous scene or tight shard sequence. Causality is reported via exposition ("He traveled," "He pieced together") rather than enacted through immediate scene-level interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative fails to achieve on-page closure with cost; it follows a "symmetric satisfaction" loop where the character leaves, muses, and returns unchanged. There is no decisive change, narrowing of options, or resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central investigation is compressed into a montage ("Hours bled into one another"), eliding the causal struggle of the puzzle-solving beat. The discovery of the box and the convenient exposition within it rely on "found diary" tropes that weaken the plot's mechanical ingenuity. However, the closure effectively executes a Conceptual Repricing of the "curse" into a necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.0)
    The piece violates the scope defaults by summarizing months and years of events rather than dramatizing a single scene or defined sequence. Closure is achieved through broad narrative summary ("The rise of the prophet was complete") rather than a specific on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The lack of a grounded "now" prevents any causal linkage between specific beats.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure ("he lifted," "he screwed," "he repeated") with no causal friction or escalation. The closure relies on an asserted internal shift ("he felt a shift within") rather than a consequence of a decisive action or paid price. The ending feels like a "soft reset" where success is granted immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot follows a linear "problem-fix" trajectory where a soft reset ("poured his will") resolves the climax without visible cost. Closure is symmetric and overly tidy, lacking the required felt or conceptual price to validate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear description of a ritual without causal friction or suspense; events happen because the schedule dictates them. Closure is achieved through a declared success ("action to unyoke was complete") rather than a hard-won consequence. The resolution feels unearned because the inciting problem (the "frantic cycle") offers no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot hinges on extreme convenience, specifically the discovery of a "ledger" behind a loose panel and the antagonist's unmotivated appearance in a vast tunnel system. The resolution is a summary ("leaked evidence sparked reforms") that lacks a dramatized decisive change or on-page cost. The narrative drive is undermined by the ease with which the protagonist resolves the central conflict (a simple side-step).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative dissolves into summary at the critical moment ("over the following afternoons"), draining tension from the climax. While the causal chain is logical, the reliance on a montage for the actual repair work distances the reader from the cost of the transformation. Closure is achieved, but the "earned" aspect is told rather than shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a linear progression with no meaningful obstacles or reversals; Elara arrives, performs the task, and succeeds without complication. The mechanism of resolution (arrow tip + kaleidoscope = code) is treated as magical technology with weak causal logic. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the goal is achieved effortlessly, lacking the required cost or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure reads as a synopsis or summary rather than a dramatized story, creating distance. While the causal chain is logical and the conceptual closure (finding the "silence") lands, the lack of scene-level immersion limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest lacking obstacles: Kaelen recalls a solution, travels instantly, and fixes the object without failure or price. The closure is a "magic fix" that restores the status quo without the required Decisive Change or felt cost, rendering the ending unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story functions as a static vignette rather than a narrative with causal drive; the ending merely restates the opening condition without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that alters stakes. The structure is circular, lacking the necessary friction or meaningful tightening to create a sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette of reflection without causal pressure; the protagonist merely stands and thinks until he changes his mind. The closure—a vow to listen deeply—arrives via unearned summary rather than a decisive change forced by the scene's events. There is no felt cost to the transformation, making the "plot" a linear progression of realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural sequence with no tension, reversal, or risk of failure; Kael intends to act and simply does so without obstruction. Closure is a summary of success ("weeks followed") rather than a scene-bound resolution with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("More residents came," "On opening night") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—everyone is healed, the protagonist is happy—without any visible cost or trade-off, failing the closure requirement. The time jump to the exhibition dissipates what little tension existed in the field.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is strictly linear and lacks a dramatized climax; the "curators" are mentioned as an audience but never manifest to provide opposition. The ending is an unearned "light wash" that claims victory and transformation without a preceding struggle or paid price. Causality is soft, relying on the convenient properties of the crystal to resolve the central problem instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative loop is functional, but the climax relies on a prop failure (chalk snapping) and a sudden onset of the attribute (forgetting) to force resolution. This accidental causality undercuts the narrative drive, leading to a situational ending that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear sequence, but the central causal link—using the sound of a falling leaf to mechanically restructure a clock for escape velocity—operates on dream logic that clashes with the technical jargon. The resolution of the external threat (tremors stopping) feels coincidental to the capture of the image, lacking a earned causal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the goal ("flawless goodbye") is achieved without meaningful obstacles. The reconciliation with the daughter is unearned, resolving years of estrangement instantly without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain is coherent, moving logically from the key insertion to the ritual. However, the closure relies on a "just the beginning" hook that dilutes the resolution's weight. The stakes feel low because the solution works on the first attempt without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magical fix" closure where an unestablished ritual instantly resolves the central internal conflict. The cause-and-effect chain is weak; the protagonist simply decides to heal, and the magic obeys without resistance or complication. The backstory (finding the body) does the heavy lifting, leaving the scene itself static.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is functional and legible, following an accumulative logic from darkness to illumination. However, the sequence lacks tension; the transition from polishing to resolution is linear and unimpeded. The closure works mechanically but feels emotionally unearned, as the stakes are low and the outcome certain.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and orientation is immediate, with a clear closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is linear and low-stakes, as the "viral" pressure is resolved through a symbolic gesture that meets no on-page resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest with no causal branching; Elara simply catches one hope after another in a repetitive loop. The ending offers &quot;symmetric satisfaction&quot; where the goal is achieved without an on-page cost or twist, failing the requirement for a decisive change with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative lacks a functional causal arc; obstacles are non-existent, and the resolution is instantaneous upon the character's arrival. The story structure is a linear progression of success without setbacks, leading to a symmetric satisfaction ending that feels unearned. Causality is replaced by declarative statements ("Everything depended on the timeframe"), resulting in an outline rather than a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural vignette rather than a story with causality and consequence; Elara performs a ritual, and it succeeds without complication or twist. The "unseen event" provides vague background context but does not exert causal pressure on the scene. Closure is a soft reset (the world sighs) without a felt cost or a reordering of the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on summary montage ("days that bled into weeks") rather than a dramatized scene with beat-by-beat causality. The closure is a "mission accomplished" state with no visible cost or reconfiguration of stakes, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure is a linear checklist ("Next came," "Then came") with no causal necessity linking the events; the sequence could be reordered without impact. Closure is achieved through task completion rather than a Decisive Change or cost, resulting in a soft ending that lacks narrative consequence or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks without causal friction; the wood yields immediately to the knife, removing narrative drive. Closure is achieved through a summary of internal resolution ("reconciled") rather than a decisive change in the character's situation or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a low-stakes epiphany driven by a magical object rather than character agency. The closure relies on an "explain-everything" realization ("time was not a line but a river") that resolves the conflict without a visible, hard-won cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a mid-story summary montage ("He spent days mapping...") rather than a dramatized scene, dissolving tension and causality. The resolution is a "soft reset" where success is inevitable, lacking a decisive change or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.3)
    The scene is coherent and oriented, but the narrative arc depends on an environmental convenience (singing crystals) to resolve the central tension. The closure is a "realization" that feels unearned by the preceding action, lacking a decisive change or legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a realization, but the epiphany is unearned by prior pressure or causality. The resolution relies on the convenience of the sundial pointing to a crack, creating a soft conceptual repricing without felt cost. The structure is static, lacking a distinct turning point where options narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the central obstacle (decoding the knots) is overcome via summary ("after what felt like an eternity"), bypassing the climax. Closure is symmetric and unearned, with no visible cost paid for the transformation from collector to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence: sit, project, realize, leave. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains thematic insight without paying a visible cost or facing a complication. The structure relies on an "explain-everything" ending where the theme is explicitly stated to resolve the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where success is achieved through convenience (moss/dew appear exactly when needed) rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. The closure is a "mission accomplished" moment with no felt cost or resonant reconfiguration; the conflict simply evaporates upon the device's activation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of events with no causal pressure or resistance; the medical procedure succeeds instantly without risk. The closure relies on a thematic declaration of "redemption" rather than a consequence earned through difficulty or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest (find shard, insert shard, wait) with low causal density and no meaningful reversals. The climax (aligning stars) is a mechanical puzzle rather than a character-defining choice. Closure is a "soft reset" where magic fixes the world, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal chain, but the pivotal turn relies on an external information dump from a machine ("It revealed a truth") rather than active discovery or struggle. The closure—a decision to encode history—is conceptually sound but arrives via summary ("Elara decided to break the cycle") rather than a dramatized beat of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Over days") that dissolves the scene's tension into a montage, breaking the single-window scope without a clear transition. Causality is weak; the protagonist succeeds simply by obeying a ghost, facing no obstacles. Closure is an abstract thematic summary rather than a dramatic event with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a credibility-breaking contrivance: precise clock calibration instructions carved onto a "broken rake handle." The resolution is a "soft reset" where decades of trauma are healed by a single maintenance task, lacking improved options or paid cost. Closure is asserted via summary rather than earned through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on convenience, notably the *deus ex machina* of the thread snapping "suddenly" to reveal the crucial journal. Progression is linear and lacks causal tension; the mystery resolves itself through passive discovery rather than active problem-solving. Closure is present but earned cheaply through abstract realization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist thinks about a problem and then solves it by writing, with the external world (the lake) magically conforming to his internal state. This "magical realism" resolution feels unearned because the mechanics of how his writing affects reality are never established, resulting in symmetric satisfaction without causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope default for short fiction without earning the deviation. The closure is weak, offering a continuation of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible on-page cost or a decisive turning point that reconfigures the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path anchored by the dying grandfather, with a legible closure unit (the completion of the portrait). However, the causality is ritualistic and low-stakes; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through pressure or choice. The pacing is functional, but the ending is tidy and explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but lacks a causal arc or decisive change; Elara begins determined and ends determined with no cost paid. The closure (finding a plate) validates her existing stance without forcing a reconfiguration of options or stakes. The orientation is clear, but the drive is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on an unearned "magic object" resolution where showing a rosette instantly dissolves deep-seated community prejudice. This breaks causality, offering a symmetric satisfaction that feels unearned because the solution (a prop) is disproportionate to the stated problem (hatred), with no visible cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal friction or obstacles; Elara intends to plant a seed, does so, and it succeeds immediately. Closure is weak and unearned, as the magical growth removes all tension without a visible cost or a "Decisive Change" in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "Symmetric Satisfaction" ending where a technical problem is solved instantly by a riddle the protagonist conveniently possesses, with no cost or trade-off. The arrival of the technician and the solution (spraying water) occur without causal struggle or complication. This acts as an "explain-everything" resolution that lacks narrative drive or earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory (arrival, action, success) without causality-driven turns or opposition. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved perfectly with no trade-off or orientation toward cost, failing the closure requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on mechanical transitions ("This led to another revelation," "Each discovery unfolded rapidly") rather than causal pressure. The closure is a utopian resolution where the protagonist fixes everything instantly with no resistance or sacrifice, resulting in unearned stasis. The "secret" functions as backstory summary rather than an inciting incident that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot hinges on a sudden shift in world logic—mathematical symbols physically manifesting to brace stone—which feels like a convenient magical fix. Closure is achieved through a soft reset of the protagonist's mindset rather than a consequence paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a repetitive "and-then" structure where the protagonist attempts a task and succeeds three times without complication. The closure acts as a "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks proof and finds it exactly as requested—lacking the necessary "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that comes from overcoming an obstacle or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative suffers from a significant causality gap: Elara is restoring the ledger page-by-page yet misses a crucial margin note ("For the bread, use the honey...") until she looks up a name found on the lens. This relies on convenient incompetence to hide the clue, as a restorer would have read the text regardless of the name. The closure itself is resonant, but the mechanism to reach it is flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—a decisive shattering of destiny—lands with a strong conceptual shift. However, the central mechanism (solving the yoyo to unlock the stone) feels slightly convenient, relying on asserted "reverse-engineering" rather than a causal chain of trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear instruction-execution loop (advisor speaks, Elara obeys) rather than protagonist-driven discovery. Closure lacks a legible cost; Elara discards a cursed object she wanted to lose, resulting in a net gain without sacrifice, violating the "visible cost" requirement for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a clear causal path, but the resolution relies on the protagonist's perfect competence, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for high-band closure. The ending reads as a "win-state" where the threat is neutralized into beauty without a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. The narrative arc is functional but mechanically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a "deus ex vision" to resolve the central mystery, delivering a paragraph of exposition to explain the antagonist's motives without causal setup. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (dread turns to purpose), but it lacks a felt cost; the protagonist solves the problem with a single attempt and accepts the revelation instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a convenient "look closer" epiphany to resolve a centuries-old mystery instantly. The causality is broken by the setting; there is no logical reason a historian would study a fragile, priceless manuscript outdoors in a damp, decaying railway station.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving clearly from entry to task to closure under an accumulative lens. The final act of sealing his own dream creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost, though the "why" of the bridge raising feels more like a setup device than a causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality breaks when the protagonist's method (stamping margins) arbitrarily leads to a physical discovery (finding a warped drawer) without logical linkage. The resolution relies on the convenient proximity of the "real" scrolls rather than a deduction derived from the stamping process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structure is a linear "fetch quest" (complete the ritual to retrieve the shadow) with a "soft reset" ending that resolves the problem without a visible cost or twist. The drive lens is nominally causal but lacks tension; the shadow returns simply because the task is finished, creating a symmetric satisfaction that lacks narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to climax to resolution with a legible Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the pivot point relies on a convenient mechanical failure (the feedback loop) to trigger the internal shift, weakening the causal link between the protagonist's specific actions and the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, puzzle-solving logic (find signal, pull lever, receive reward) that lacks genuine causality or cost. The resolution depends on convenient architectural alignments rather than character agency. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—a reward is given without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality relies on the implausible coincidence of finding a specific, small wooden carving on a tidal shore years after it was created. This "driftwood library" mechanism functions as a convenient plot device to force the resolution, bypassing a genuine causal chain or earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution is unearned; a decades-long conflict seemingly pivots on a single prop and a brief exchange without resistance or cost. The causality feels magical rather than psychological—Kael capitulates instantly upon seeing the drawer pull. Closure is "happy" but lacks the requisite structural weight or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a legible causal arc with a clear inciting incident, climax (loss of compass), and resolution (arrival). However, the closure—a realization that the compass was unnecessary—feels low-cost since the compass was established as broken from the start, softening the impact of the Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal friction; obstacles (the labyrinth, the reflection) do not push back. The resolution is a soft reset where the cost is explicitly negated ("not as burdens, but as lessons"), failing the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear and the closure (metamorphosis and reunion) lands on the page with a defined cost. However, the progression is linear and summary-heavy ("The method was precise"), lacking scene-level friction or unexpected complications.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The single-scene structure is coherent, and the orientation in the glade is established quickly. However, the narrative relies on a "soft reset" where the ritual mechanically solves the protagonist's problem without a distinct, high-cost turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual progression lacking a decisive turn or "try-fail" cycle that deepens the cost. Closure is a simple success state; the transition to the new dimension feels earned by the premise's magic logic rather than by narrative causality or significant sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on the accidental fulfillment of a prophecy the protagonist is unaware of, removing agency from the climax. Closure acts as a soft reset with no felt cost; the loss of the jars is immediately negated by "profound peace," lacking the friction of a true decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence where the inciting incident (the blackout) conveniently solves the primary obstacle (visibility/guards) rather than complicating the protagonist's path. Closure is a tidy victory lap with no visible or felt cost; the protagonist returns to the status quo largely unchanged, having faced no meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a convenient loop where precognition identifies a flaw that is instantly fixed with a minor adjustment, lacking causal struggle. The central premise of a frictionless world is physically contradicted by the protagonist walking on a bluff and stacking rocks that stay in place. Closure lands as a realization ("learning to move with it") but lacks a visible or felt cost, reading as a reward for a trivial task.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=2.7)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence; the stranger arrives precisely when the timer hits zero, a contrived Deus Ex Machina that resolves the conflict without protagonist agency. The ending offers a "soft reset" where healing is instantaneous and the vigil transforms without a visible or felt cost. Causality is broken by the dream logic of the stranger’s convenient appearance and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.7)
    The plot relies on "video game logic" where a sewing needle mechanically unlocks a stone sundial, which strains credibility even in a fantasy context. The resolution is unearned; the shift from dueling to collaboration happens instantly via a scroll found through a convenient puzzle, bypassing the need for a genuine interpersonal turn. The closure is tidy and low-cost, lacking the friction of a real decision.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc or decisive change; the characters begin hopeful and end more hopeful without facing a test. Closure is absent, replaced by a summary of future intent ("But they would return") that requires no cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path of "problem → pre-planned solution → success" without significant causal complication or cost. The escape into the film functions as a soft reset, effectively teleporting the protagonist away from the stakes without forcing a trade-off or a reconfiguration of meaning. The closure represents a change of location rather than a change of stance, lacking a felt price for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on linear "and then" sequencing with convenient magic (instant tree growth) resolving the central problem. The ending is a "soft reset" where the threat vanishes without a felt price or meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear fetch quest where a magical object resolves the protagonist's internal conflict without requiring a difficult choice or sacrifice. The causality is driven by the convenience of the compass rather than character agency, leading to a "soft reset" closure where finding a locket instantly transmutes deep regret into peace without a visible cost. The connection between the lace instructions and the compass feels arbitrary, serving the prompt list rather than organic story logic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from inkwell uncorking through note progression to personal confession; Charged Poise closure in "He folded it tight and pressed it deep...now permanently underwater" reconfigures absences with undeniable opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: blackout therefore sundial decoding therefore armory intrigue; orientation anchored early in fort/twilight/Elara. Closure as Charged Poise in "small, satisfied smile in the darkness," reconfiguring options with felt secrecy cost (guards confused). One tightening via blackout window narrows path effectively; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from rock placement to dust ignition and CR closure ("patterns were not just in the stars, but in the eels..."); cost legible in curse lifting after fulfillment, with vision-constrained causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm, timer, scars builds to CR closure in poem-sharing image with felt cost of past silence broken.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with motif density building to CR closure in "We seek the same truth" declaration during lunge, reweighting rivalry with foreclosed aggression cost; orientation anchored early in atrium; single scene tightening via scroll reveal suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the greenhouse becomes an “active site of becoming,” a Conceptual Repricing that reframes ruin as process. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns reweight the stake—and the final cadence shift is felt. Cost is conceptual but legible in the last image. Minor waiver: orientation (who-where-when) is deliberately late (~130 w), yet the disorientation serves the closing payoff, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: smuggler ledger → rival name → decision to create. Orientation is clean—canyon, night, frost—within 50 words. The closure is an Earned Stasis (renunciation of revenge) but cost is only rhetorical (“scorched testament to her own strength”) rather than embodied; no new constraint or price shapes future tactics. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each silent fork-strike layers color-density toward the RR final image. Orientation clean by 80 words; conservatory rules stable. Mid-scene flashback block (capsizing) is >20 % but anchored to fork-on-forehead cue and tilts present goal, so BRR safe. Closure legible: silence-canvas reweighted to music-without-sound; cost is irrevocable solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal spine is thin: package → curiosity → dive → fix lens → souls freed. Each step is stated, not tested; the “impossible space” moonlight shaft appears only at the instant it solves the problem, so the decisive change feels engineered rather than earned. Orientation is clear early, lens is Accumulative/Textural, closure lands as Charged Poise, but the missing cost keeps it short of 7.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: bell raised, declaration whispered, cost felt in the hush. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of midnight runs → bell chimes → tokens left—but the tightening is one-note (sanctions stay static). No new constraint or price appears at the end; the “future” is asserted, not foreclosed, so the reconfiguration is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last spark-release re-weights the premise—love was never lost, only stored—with luminous, undeniable cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; each breath-tuned revelation deepens pattern rather than narrows option, but the final dissolving strand makes the before/after legible. Orientation is taught early and kept; no props teleport. Meets 9+ quick test save for the soft causal lens; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each hyperbolic fold increases the density of retrocognitive noise until the pattern break (bridge disintegration) reweights the stake from “escape the past” to “inhabit the weave.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the oldest bridge unweaves into motes of light, the visions fracture, and Elara’s stance crystallizes into Charged Poise—time is tapestry, not river. Cost is legible in the final image: the halo fragment now “dim and inert,” the photographs gone, the garden breathing new geometry—loss made visible. Causality holds: the hyperbolic folds she engineers causally trigger the dissolution that frees her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is present—arrow → piano map → vault → planting—but the pivotal decryption is glossed in a single clause (“she began to play a silent melody of decryption”) that hides the actual micro-choices. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: chains loosen as green shoots appear, implying liberation, yet the physical mechanism (why chains drop) is skipped, blunting cost legibility. Orientation is clear by 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One substantive tightening occurs when the wall chunk collapses, forcing vault entry, but the beat is repeated in summary three separate times, blurring escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of divided cells multiplying reweights absences as growth, aurora fading into silence signals cost. Accumulative lens holds—density of salt, rust, bitter apples, and harvested silences tighten the stake until the cadence releases. Orientation is swift (sunken greenhouse by line 3). No lens ambiguity; because/therefore linkage is loose but coherence accumulates through pattern, not causality. Cost is conceptual—she forecloses vengeance on sound itself—yet felt in the exhausted aurora hush.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stolen future glints in her chest with undeniable conceptual cost—“she had stolen a fragment of destiny itself.” Causal chain is clean: moonbeam → reveals future → swap → escape via flower code. Orientation is crisp by word 50; shifts hold. The single reversal (black-orchid trap) is coincidence-driven, not because/therefore, but under Accumulative lens the density jump is sufficient. Cost is legible in the empty jar and the city that “held its breath,” satisfying 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sphere and bookmark left behind reconfigure the control room into a reliquary of inquiry, with felt cost (“weighty lightness”). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the thaw outside and the heart within tighten in parallel, but the lens is taught early and held. Orientation anchors by line three, no teleporting props. The studio abandonment—the causal trigger—arrives as backstory capsule; because it is the decisive change engine, withholding it from scene slightly weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causal chain is clean: betrayal → shell → decrypt → tower confrontation. Orientation anchors within 120 words and the inferred lens (Causal) holds to closure. Closure is a Decisive Change—Leo openly confronts Silas—but the “felt cost” is rhetorical (“his certainty no longer trembling”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on-page, slightly softening the CR requirement. No teleporting props or outline-drag; every beat advances knowledge or option narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the glowing booklet delivers a spiritual map and the single star brightens, re-weighting the silence. Cost, however, is only aesthetic (gold leaf flakes on fingers); nothing is foreclosed for the oracle herself, so the turn feels vicarious. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the absence of causal risk keeps the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained: each violin pass layers density rather than causal turning points, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the timelines collapse into a Charged Poise of understanding. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure. Cost is conceptual, not visceral—the price is the fragility of the ice violin itself—but the text explicitly labels the insight rather than letting the final image reweight it, muting the sting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens-ticket projection chain creates a tidy causal trail that cleanly reverses suspicion into shared truth; closure lands on a communal nod that reweights the forecourt from accusation to harmony. Orientation is swift and spatially steady, but the beat-to-beat linkage is almost too smooth—lacks a middle tightening that would make the final transparency feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the skeptics’ flickering luck-meters reprice the world’s premise in favor of unmeasurable care—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polished marble adds density until the final display crystallizes meaning. One soft patch: the maze “breathing” is repeated without tactile cue, slightly dulling the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: Kael’s private theory → twilight alignment → lever → hologram proof → shared reconfiguration of scientific truth. Orientation is clean within 80 words; the nexus and dormancy clock are anchored early. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the lateral-time model’s glow reweights their worldview, and the cost is the station’s habitual reserve melting into vulnerable camaraderie—felt in Dr. Aris’s hand on Kael’s shoulder. No causal breaks; the Mothraals’ stirring is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost’s smile and steadying lanterns reconfigure the house from haunted to memorial, with undeniable conceptual cost—she inherits an untranscribable legacy. Causal lattice holds: water-drop → stain → map → slap → release, each because/therefore linkage tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“chest-high water”), well inside 120-word guardrail. No lens ambiguity; progression is strictly causal. Persistent constraint—the ruined violin she lifts—shapes the final image and signals the price of transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure arrives as a soft conceptual shift—“lightness of truth”—rather than a decisive action or charged poise with felt cost; the recalibration is narrated, not dramatized, so the before/after is legible only in thematic assertion. Causal linkage is weak: the smudge on the drawing does not mechanically alter any sensor or forecast; the storm trend is discovered off-stage in historical charts, not through her oracle gift under pressure. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural but the final image reweights nothing palpable, so the cost is intellectual, not experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: because he decodes the caller’s confession he recognises the valve, therefore he can silence the ghost-shift. Closure is a Decisive Change—phantom machines stop, tunnel pressure lifts, cost is the weight he now shoulders. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens drift. One minor ellipsis: the radio’s sudden crystal-clear reception inside a steel tunnel is unexplained, but it does not break the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every paragraph thickens the same motif—decay as transformation—until the final image reweights it. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the keeper folds the swan, sealing the refuge, while the library’s “crumbling peace” is re-seen as renewal. Cost is felt in the silence that replaces action; no causality gaps appear.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motif repetitions (eclipse, curl, roots, adaptive melody) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the curl passes to the child while Elara keeps playing, a quiet reconfiguration that lets us feel the cost of continuity. Cost is present but soft—“content” and “warm heart” tell more than they show; a sharper pang would lift the score. Orientation, causality, and taught pattern hold, satisfying the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the axis is not physically restored but Elian’s perception realigns, charging the final “bronze quiet” with audible memory. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each relic beat layers density until the tapestry glows; the cost is the irreversibility of “no new dreams,” felt in the last line. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 5; no penalty. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction; the fireplace diaries function as taught pattern that pays off in the device activation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last image of two silhouettes weaving collaborative futures transposes isolation into shared stewardship of the beacon; cost is felt because both have burned their old lives (spy clearance gone, hermit solitude gone). Causal chain holds: microdot coordinates → Leo’s arrival → joint cache recovery → evidence burnishes names; each beat narrows options toward partnership. Lighthouse geography is anchored by ~120w and never contradicted; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the entity’s dissolution is triggered by the exposed fallacy that silence = power, a rule-shift with undeniable cost to the invader and to Elian’s spent pigment. Causality is causal-loop tight: each rhetorical question narrows the entity’s ontological options until the looped silence weaponizes. The 9+ gate is satisfied because the final image (ordinary sounds returning) reweights the whole premise under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory memory adds density until the dawn light refracts into a visible crescendo. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes as “conductor,” the unheard symphonies now externalized into the glass spire’s hum; the cost is felt in her collapse from fatigue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5; no penalty. The mirrored horizon reweights the premise at the end, making the conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the viaduct’s light steadies, tablet inert, Kaelen simply present. The fracturing/integration causal chain holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural density builds to crystallized stance). Cost is visible—“each integration felt like a part of him dying”—and the final quiet is irreversible. Drive lens is taught early and never contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed phonograph re-weights silence from absence to fullness, with visible cost—Elara weeps, marks clay, forefeeds her prior isolation. Causal linkage is lean but intact: broken needle → backward spin → tactile vibration → emotional thaw → clay mark → restored teaching stance. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cavern, autumn leaves, Kael’s sawdust). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (muted soundscape) and deepened by each sensual layer until final image crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara forecloses pure solitude by opening the gate, cost legible in “layered tranquility now enriched with alliance.” Causal chain holds: pigeon → data cross-check → alliance offer; each because/therefore tightens options. One transition (dusk-to-night) is legible; orientation anchored by line 3. Minor loop: “layered tranquility” reused three times without reweighting until final line; slight drag, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: pollen = ancestral residue, tears = love’s fingerprint; cost is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of scent/light imagery reweights the stake once. Orientation crystal-clear by line 3. Causality gap: UV lantern is introduced as fait accompli rather than earned tactic, a minor but visible seam.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    A clean Accumulative/Textural lens: each pass over the rope and each new shimmer of the auroras thickens the pattern until the sacrifice reweights everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—he is “empty of his past but full of a new…understanding”—with the felt cost of erased memories. Orientation is swift—terra-cotta grotto, starlight, post-arrival world by line 3. No因果 gaps; the final image crystallizes options under the invented rule that rope=life-moments.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-capture beat thickens the silence until the bonfire reconfigures it into resonant Charged Poise; orientation is swift, cost is felt in the bowl’s pulse, no causal leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the blotter-petal drop is a Decisive Change with felt cost—her trade literally crumbles. Causal lens holds throughout: “static crackle → detects residue → senses hollowness → drops petal.” Orientation is anchored by 63 words; no debt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the grotto’s static reweights her synthetic joy into ash. The final image reconfigures her future tactics without exposition. Minor slip: “transformation completed” is iterated three times, a templated cadence that dulls the last beat by −0.3, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a CR image: stars overhead shimmer “with approval,” reweighting Elara’s world toward compassion; the conceptual cost—she will keep integrating kindness into contracts—is legible. The causal chain holds: envelope slip → investigation → friendship → community honoring; each “because” advances options. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. However, the final beat is narrated summary rather than a crystallized gesture, muting the Resonant Reconfiguration punch.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: outsider → offers help → guides search → finds tag → is embraced.  Orientation is clean by word 60; crater, orchard, arbor anchored in sensory motion.  The single micro-turn—spotting the spiral—narrows options and reweights identity.  Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor becomes sacred ground and her ache flips to radiance, but the cost (loss of solitude, exposure of secret) is named rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the uncaged echoes burst and the world re-tunes; the personal price (ageing) is felt in the final beat. The causal chain is lyric-elliptical but coherent under an Accumulative lens: each pulse of borrowed time intensifies texture until the cadence snaps. Orientation is taught by kinetic image early, satisfying the disorientation waiver. The “giant’s nap” timer is a successful conceptual constraint that shapes tactics and pays off in the awakening lurch.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a classic Conceptual Repricing: the glass eyes project Lyra’s emotional imprint, reframing mathematics from cure to integration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drip/ripple layers density until the mosaic reweights the stake. Cost is legible: the tool remains embedded, signaling permanent surrender to mystery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the library hush re-weights the premise—visibility achieved through sound, not sight—cost paid by Kaelen’s retreat to darkness. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory echo (sapphire hush, tape crackle) tightens the same stake until the final image crystallizes options. No orientation drift; “who-where-when” anchored by word 50. Lens = Accumulative/Textural, held without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure hinges on a Conceptual Repricing: releasing the leaf re-weights her entire scientific paradigm. Causal lens holds throughout—each storm beat because/therefore strips away a prop or belief until the final image of her soaked beside the tree. Cost is visible: she forfeits her identity as controller and accepts an open-ended “community of survivors.” One micro loop of “reconstruction” rhetoric near the end is too minor to nick the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen’s insomnia becomes a purposeful vigil, the brooch exchanged for Elara’s story crystallizes a new stance toward memory. Causal chain holds—rain leads to artifacts, artifacts to Elara, exchange to altered self—though the “decision” to trade is narrated in a single sentence without visible hesitation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the drizzle-pattern teaches the method early and the final canvas reweights the stake with felt cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave’s song now reaches the villages, a visible reweighting of the premise. Causality is cleanly accumulative: Elara’s memory-focus → pearl-flare → rain-mist → village magic. Orientation is crisp in first 60 words; only one transition (surface→depth). The lack of foreseen cost on Kaelen slightly blunts the “earned” test.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the first trumpet note reweights exile from wound to layered history with undeniable conceptual cost—voices once erased are now amplified. Causal chain holds: because she finds missing-ship log → therefore she reframes exile → therefore she risks public speech. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by word 42 (“ivory harbor gleamed…”) avoids penalty. One smooth transition (evening→fog) keeps mosaic within Track B rules.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causal chain is present—crack-arrows → punch → vault → sphere → release—but motivation for the dare remains exogenous (a stranger) and the punch’s rule-set is revealed only at the moment it solves the problem, softening the climax. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (mist, mythic geography) is deliberate and pays off by making the vault reveal feel other-worldly. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (“she walked away… starlit clarity”) with conceptual rather than visceral cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Still, the late-rule reveal of the punch keeps the beat from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the villagers’ seated silence reweights the tile’s promise into lived stillness; Elara’s prior solitude is foreclosed with the phrase “she had woven a new memory.” Accumulative lens holds: each copied symbol thickens atmospheric density until the hush becomes legible. Causality intact—transcription triggers glow → memory flood → invitation → shared poise. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the tower’s air is “thick with shared memories,” a price she must now steward.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: solar storm → magnetic lever → fragment resonance → rift → mutual betrayal. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the cave collapses to a point, leaving immortality “terribly new.” Cost is conceptual—cyclical hello/goodbye infinity—but felt only in the final clause; a hairline slip keeps it sub-9. Orientation anchors by word 60, well inside the waiver line.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each guard-study/flower-delivery step is a because/therefore that narrows to the mental breach. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “rigidity fractures, but fluidity endures” reweights Leo’s moral rule-set with social cost (chief’s conscience). Cost is legible on-page: emptied pot, dawn isolation. No plot amnesia; ink-pot logic is consistent, payoff foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lamp’s drone steadies, Elian closes the book, and the reader feels the before/after shift—another invisible archive sealed. Causality is accumulative/textural: each waver of the hum layers density until the dawn “refracts” into a new stratum of invented history. Orientation is seamless—place, time, and mission are anchored within the first 60 words. The only minor slip is that the town’s silence is named but never leveraged as pressure; still, the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the overheard name reweights every prior fragment, and the taste of arsenic charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—each tide-marked shard intensifies meaning rather than causal plot. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before the 120-word threshold via distinct container-and-tide cues. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: “the riddle is you” reframes the quest as self-referential, a Conceptual Repricing with felt melancholic cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cello note layers memory until the stake flips from answers to acceptance. Orientation is swift; no causal or prop breaks. The price is legible in the final image of her sitting in “gloomy cheerfulness,” path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal spine holds: because ships approach → Elara paints; because she paints → meeting is covertly called; closure’s Resonant Reconfiguration (raft-stone fusion) carries felt conceptual cost. Orientation locked by word 60, lens stays situational-pressure. No teleport props, clean. Beat count is thin—only one real action—so escalation is more announced than tested, keeping it out of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the photograph and the grain together reweight the Moon’s future—what was timeless is now inventory. The causal chain is lean: vial color-shift → shutter click → data sealed; each step forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the spent chemicals and the sunlit crater that “was” but will cease; no exposition dilutes the beat. The lens holds accumulative: every hue transition thickens the stakes until the final image slams them into history.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s successful flight reconfigures the depot’s atmosphere and Elara’s sense of connection. Causal chain is linear—storm corruption → refraction diagnosis → patch → test—but the anchor-lifting clock is ornamental; the patch is finished before the chain finishes rattling, so deadline pressure never constricts options. One soft reset: the “chaotic symphony” of feedback becomes “clear, decipherable data” instantly after a single software tweak, muting visible cost. Lens holds as Causal; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: condensation, falcon, and phrasebook form a repeating triad whose density peaks when the rivulets map onto “tributary” lines and the steam fissure births a literal stream. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s recognition that this genesis is merely “a chapter” reweights the entire quest with conceptual cost: knowledge changes nothing. Anchors (who/where/when) are legible within 30 words; no transitions break the single scene. One minor causal gap: the leather token appears only at the end and is not integrated into the condensation-phrasebook logic, a hairline slip that keeps the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each footstep and fork-hum layers density until the ghost-town air itself “hums” in a Charged Poise. Causality is metaphorical—rhythm revives memory—but the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: the living must now keep the beat alive. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; the town’s nameless status is deliberate disorientation that pays off at closure. Closure lands with felt cost (“the wild hush returned, but now filled with life”), satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: silence thickens, phosphorescence accrues, oxygen gauge blinks—each beat layers density rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corked vial crystallizes cost (“heavy with captured memory”) while surfacing still hangs in the reader’s mind. One soft spot: the “phantom priests” memory-tutor risks expository short-hand; could break causality if read as deus ex mechanica.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each confessional whisper adds narrative filament that reweights the beacon; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the beam purifies and the hover-guards dissolve—cost is the lifelong taint of distrust now made visible in the steady light. Orientation is clean (lighthouse prison, imminent inspection, night-of-escape) by line 3. No causal gaps; the lattice grooves aligning with floor scratches is the single tightening that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ghost’s iterative cameos tighten mood until the bead transfer catalyzes resonant awakening—an earned RR with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric but coherent; closure image (“bead on the shelf”) reweights the premise without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated stitching and glowing lines accrue until the labyrinth “breathes.” Orientation is clear by line 3, causality is loose but permissible under this lens, yet the single tightening (last stitch triggers awakening) is announced rather than shown—no rubble shifts, no sound, no physical cue—so the Decisive Change lacks felt mass. The storybook plate is the only persistent constraint, but its rules are never limited (could she run out of thread? could the image fade?) so tension plateaus. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is abstract (“broken precedents sighed”) rather than personal, keeping the RR short of poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow points to the scrolls, reweighting the premise from loss to continuity with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each unearthed layer tightens the stakes until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor loop artifact (“interrupted journeys” phrasing repeated four times) nicks the ending cadence but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal lens holds: each chalk mark is a because/therefore link that theoretically narrows interception risk. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—golden corridor, letter falling, codes soon alive—but the cost is only projected (“could change the course”), not felt on-page. No persistent constraint or price shapes the final image; the arc is a smooth success. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snuffed candle reweights every prior glimmer of light into threat. Causal chain holds—each tug of thread reveals guard betrayal that in turn forces her to blow the flame. Under Accumulative lens, the candle’s extinction is the pattern-break that makes the tapestry’s new constellation legible. Orientation anchored by word 60—“Cobalt Observatory courtyard”—and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the letters physically dissolve, the shard goes cold, and the path out appears—an undeniable before/after charged with cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each condensed message tightens the pattern until the final leaf reframes the entire stake. Causality is intact; the shard’s moon-lit activation is seeded early and paid off in the decisive image. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and deepen through sensory filtration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each decrypted symbol adds density until the two-holding-hands image reweights trauma into connection; the coral’s remembered warmth supplies felt cost, satisfying closure with no causal gaps or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s ghostly bloom reconfigures the fog’s meaning and carries conceptual cost—she must keep working inside ruin. Causal chain is loose; the fragment “reacts” by unexplained optics, network input is told not shown, and the prism/algae lack set-up, so the lens wobbles between Causal and Accumulative. Still, the final image reweights prior decay and gives undeniable before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the hovering coin and self-healing mural reconfigure meaning—she will never receive an answer, and that is the gift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflected sound wave adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“in the Sound Wave Garden”). One causality bump: the sudden “thousand silent questions” arrives unseeded, but the final image absorbs the micro-jolt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: cognitive tax → secret plant-codes → scanner raid → rattle-cacophony scramble → escape. One clear transition (corner → enforcer burst) anchored early; spatial grammar keeps bodies/props tracked. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses surrender, pockets the gourd, accepts perpetual flight; cost is felt in “ready for the next garden,” future narrowed to itinerant war. No retro-patching or luck save; pressure tightens because her tactic (botanical cipher) is exactly what auditors now target, forcing improvisational scatter-seed defense. Minor loop: “converging chaos” phrase repeats thrice; doesn’t touch last beat, so stays under cap.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: repetitions of “half-sung lullabies / off-key wind” tighten pattern until the echo returns, landing a Charged Poise closure—the shell hums with “returned peace.” Orientation delivered lyrically but legibly within 120 words: who (poet), where (gargantuan shell), when (centuries of night). No causal reversals, yet the cadence shift from solitary song to answered chorus is a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is felt: centuries of insomnia crystallize into one final lullaby, foreclosing further pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chime is healed via the forgotten song, restoring the echo-system; cost is felt as “foxglove regret” sharpened by the reminder of humanity’s abandonment. Causal chain is sequential and complete; no teleporting props. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through atmospheric density and pattern repetition rather than because/therefore reversals; this lens is signaled early and held to the final image. Orientation is firm by 60 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she writes vow #1, the glyph glows; therefore she risks vow #2, etc., each promise escalating the stakes until the scroll rewrites itself. Orientation is clean—who, where, when, and the dawn clock are anchored within 60 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the overflow of light and audible harmony makes the “before/after” legible, and the cost is the years of silence she cannot retroactively erase. Persistent constraint: the ink can only react to earnest truth, shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the gates now “harmonize” utility and reverence, the building’s softer breath confirming success. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each measured tremor and micro-adjustment layers until the cadence shifts. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only bar to 9-band is the light causal footprint: the stakes never tighten enough to foreclose a live option; success feels pre-assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic becomes sanctuary, songs are released, and trust is chosen—cost is the exposure of her invented past and the irrevocable launch of the encoded pigeons. Causal drive holds: each return visit tightens Leo’s access to truth and Elara’s willingness to yield it. However, the letter discovery is an off-stage convenience that slightly dilutes the agency of the final beat; the ending still reweights meaning under the skylight image, keeping the lens coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “necessary distances are bridges” reweights the premise and is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is poetic rather than literal—grain patterns → intuition → sacred insight—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image. Orientation is delayed (“drifting prism terrace floated in a fractured hush”) yet the disorientation is functional, so the Orientation Test is waived. A persistent constraint (the terrace’s drift) shapes attention and the final stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sunrise-lit city and warmed feather re-weight the premise with felt cost (she leaves the sunken world she briefly claimed). Causal chain is light—bioluminescence arrives as gift, not consequence—but the accumulative pattern (star maps → feather → firefly echo) justifies the lens. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored within 50 words. The only slack is the 30-year-backstory datapad dump mid-scene; it pauses momentum without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece strings luminous images rather than causal links; the “disappearing paths” question is announced early but not tightened by a decisive change or renunciation with felt cost. Closure is a soft conceptual lift (“disappearance is transformation”) rather than a charged poise that forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece strings sensuous micro-moments rather than causal chains. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise—final image of “endless campaign” reconfigures earlier beats—but the cost is only asserted (“memory lingered”), not shown. The pattern holds, yet the tightening is emotional assertion rather than option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands: the verse is irreversibly etched, exile flips to purpose, moonstone fades—cost is felt. Causal chain holds: nostalgia ban → exile → dance → dust → skin. Orientation clear by line 6; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, tightened by final image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sunrise refracting through the atrium re-weights the dredging threat from menace to accepted ripple. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through mist, stone, rings, spectrum—held cleanly to the last image. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words) and causality intact; the only minor slack is that the dredge itself never impinges on scene time, so the cost is purely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the needle steadies in green, the grotto hums, and the timelines feel subtly reweighted—cost is conceptual (perpetual cycle of labor) rather than visceral, but legible. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern-completion substitutes for because/therefore linkage, and the lens holds, yet the final beat is slightly diffuse because the balloon/gauge readings are reported rather than witnessed in real time, softening the decisive snap.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diaries/negative reweight her vocation from “mapping echoes” to “carrying burdens,” with the satchel’s weight standing in for felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each artifact layers guilt until the corridor’s hum reframes her purpose. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. However, escalation is ambient, not driven by a tightening choice; the preserved memory is encountered, not pursued through narrowing options, so pressure plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each refrain of the lullaby thickens the pattern and the prism-droplets refract new light, tightening the mood until the first bell. Closure is a Charged Poise—mirrors hold possibilities for one breath—so cost is conceptual, not felt. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causal break, but escalation is purely tonal, lacking a narrowing option or tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s life-force leaves her body while the clans clasp hands, a visible, irreversible cost that reweights the terrace from war-memorial to living peace-shrine. Causal chain is tight: each chant beat draws moonlight into the clipboard, which then projects binding light; no prop teleports, no rule is invented late. Orientation is clean—who, where, when anchored by line 12. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of “price,” “cracks,” “muster” accrues until the final fade reconfigures meaning. One tightening only, but it is decisive; meets the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the light pulses into the cracks, a felt conceptual cost that forever weathers the air with guilt. Accumulative lens holds—each salt fissure is a density beat that reweights the stake until the release reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (white expanse, salt flat, drought). No telegraphing or plot amnesia; the egg stays tracked, the map taught early, the storm clock clear.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: lullaby → courtyard → harvest → sanctuary → rewritten self. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—her breath no longer answers to the citadel’s cadence—landing under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece lands a legitimate Conceptual Repricing closure: the final image of Elara walking back toward the neon bars with the stick now “relieved of old burdens” reweights the premise—ethical storytelling pivots from confrontation to redemption. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than event-driven; pressure tightens through iterative realizations inside the dome, each adding density to the stake rather than narrowing external options. One scaffold loop appears (“meteor hush… hush…”) but it does not touch the closure beat, so -0.2 only. Closure cost is felt in the stick’s redefinition and her revised mission; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is stable, though late clarity keeps it just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the wing drifts away while the monarch departs, reweighting the entire stake from preservation to release. Causal lens holds—each twig, petal, and knot is a because/therefore step toward that image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “carrying the blushing stillness within him”—the price is lifelong internalization of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the rope becomes a “lattice of luminescent remembrance,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the card disintegrates, the names are now inseparably fused to the artifact. Causal chain is intact: card codes the rope → rope sings → card dies. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no disorientation served later, so no penalty. Lens is Causal; each braid-tweak tightens options until sound is the only path left. One minor loop: “technically gentle” is asserted twice without new inflection, but it never obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wall-become-gateway reweights every prior echo of path vs. walker. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-images and seal-dust accrues until meaning flips. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“vine-draped bunker”). No causality break; the seal’s dissolution is the engine, not luck. Persistent constraint: the decaying directive shapes each micro-choice until it vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fused tile reweights the palace into a “monument to encrypted devotion,” cost felt in the irreversible fusion and the astronomer’s emptied satchel of further moves. Causal lattice holds—each schematic alignment tightens the next—so the lens stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    The closure image (silent melody of renewal) is a poetic assertion without an on-page cost: no forfeiture, no risk, no foreclosed path. Causality runs on magical hand-waves—"reality shifts," "cellular memory," and a pin that auto-repairs—so the because/therefore chain is metaphysical fiat rather than character-driven. The single meaningful turn (Kael forgives) is off-stage cognition; we are told it happens rather than shown the decisive beat where he chooses renunciation. Because the cylinder’s reappearance is consequence-free, the promised price never materializes, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror’s captured glass-mountain glow reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he can now access the dream only through a fragment. Causal chain holds: broken sextant → breathing ritual → mirror cage; no late rule changes. The Orientation Test is passed by ~70 words. Persistent constraint (mirror as sole portal) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—exile → retrieve bag → craft gift → reunion—holds, and the hair-ribbon return supplies visible closure cost. Transitions are smooth, but the orchard-as-setting is introduced late (after retrieval) and the “deciduous vows” epiphany is narrated rather than dramatized, blunting the decisive change. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the cameo blank’s reweighting from “unfinished” to “erased gap” tightens the stake once, and the final image of placing it back among the roots lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she forecloses the path of conquest and accepts curation-as-process. Orientation is swift; nonlinear inheritance is taught by 120 words and closure pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: diary gap → library path → Kael’s confession → timeline heal. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara stays, “lessons silently echo,” cost felt. One soft spot: the library’s shift-to-intention rule is declared late, not seeded, so the turn feels lightly retroactive rather than foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the wall is whole again but the clock tower now beats with an extra life, a permanent ontological surcharge. The causal chain—seal → rope → diplomat restored—never breaks; each step is triggered by Elara’s visible re-weaving, not coincidence. The “soft click” and “light pulsed from the rope” are the exact on-page images where cost becomes undeniable. The lens (Causal) is inferred by line 5 and never loosens; the final tick holds the new story inside the mechanism, a constraint that will shape every future archive query.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each ice-crack read therefore tightens her conjuring options until the silence wave lands. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: stone left glowing in niche crystallizes new balance, cost legible in her knee-buckling exhaustion. One causality nick: energy beings’ shift from chaos to cooperation is summarized not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gentle beam rewrites the rule of “shard of hush” without exposition, letting the final image carry undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: star-path tracking → prism angles → retrocognitive cues → light burst; no ellipsis break. The 120-word orientation anchor is clean—glass pavilion, post-Collapse night, solitary custodian—so no penalty. One minor scaffold appears (“she realized…”) but it’s outside the climax and does not dull the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the solid fog shimmers, the hush turns companion, and identity is re-sculpted with the felt cost of eternal porousness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—echoes, shadows, whispers layer until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causal breaks. Single micro-turn (fog’s shimmer) suffices; escalation is dense pattern-break, not because/therefore, so lens coherence is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: chant tunes → ambient read → rag ignition → fireworks → hope lifted. Orientation is crisp inside 120 words; dusk, gravel, jasmine ground us immediately. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last ember’s fall and the memory-glow reconfigure meaning for watchers and reader alike, cost legible in the spent rag and starless sky now “humming.” The only drag is a mild “and-then” cadence in the mid-section where beats accumulate without tightening options—pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cicada reweights “leaving” into “shedding,” with felt cost in Kael’s slow nod. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tidal imagery accumulates until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean: who/when/where anchored within first 60 words. No lens ambiguity; tidal pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the bunker is still a prison, but its walls now “stretch” because the gilded hush is bottled beside the doll—conceptual cost legible in one image. Causal lens holds: inversion predicts ascent → tether limits exposure → vial captures silence → descent reweights the bunker. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 30. No teleporting props; the doll’s warmth and vial’s glow track consistently. The inversion rule is taught early and paid off at the exact instant the flower sprouts.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each refracted image and vial-clearing beat thickens the hush until the final “vaulting hush” reweights silence as embrace. Closure is a Charged Poise—the gondola glides on, silence now companionable—whose conceptual cost (she will eternally repeat this work) is legible. The causality is poetic rather than kinetic, acceptable under the lyric pattern taught early. Minor lull mid-story keeps it just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clear—flake→murals→door→stair→throne—but escalation is linear, not tightening; each mural simply gives the next key. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she inherits a ruined world she can never unknow (holograms of “history flowing into her”). Orientation is firm by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is present and resonant: the final image of two people breathing under fading starlight reconfigures the premise—silence becomes shared lungful air—under Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; the “because” is psychic resonance through scars, not concrete beat-by-beat linkage, and that pattern is announced early and held. Cost is felt conceptually rather than physically, satisfying the cost test. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 5; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: past trauma → volunteering → bolt-as-lens → diamond is legible and lands with visible cost (the bolt is gone). Orientation is clear within 120 words; transitions are smooth; closure satisfies CR by repricing the rusted bolt into diamond. One causality wobble: glitch-text mechanics are declared, never constrained—parallel selves never risk wrong advice. Still, the single-scene arc tightens once and fulfills lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is present: a conceptual repricing—he now sees himself as pawn, not author, and exits to expose the manipulators. The bridge-of-intuition device is the mechanism, but its rules are never taught; the standing-wave metaphor is pretty but opaque, so the repricing is felt more as assertion than earned reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb crystallizes every path not taken and the pamphlet disintegrates, so a before/after is legible with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-tracing and chant deepen density until reality reconfigures. The lens holds, but orientation wobbles: “reality felt thin” is vague anchor at 120-word mark; waiver denied because the payoff reuses the same vagueness. One meaningful tightening—program glows, orb appears—suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the button’s re-display reweights the archive from “neglect” to “hope,” with visible cost in Elara’s spent evening and opened wound. Causality is sound—dust pattern reading → letters found → Miller tracked → Jonah’s legacy revealed—though the tightening happens off-stage (Jonah’s adulthood, Miller’s survival). The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causal linkage is present yet slack: the puddle-map coincidence complicates but never genuinely endangers; the key instantly unlocks voices without prior obstacle. Orientation is clean—city, dusk, library, lagoon anchored by word 60. The closure beat (withdraw key, figures fade, stories “live within him”) is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights memory itself, but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on Kael’s body or choices. Persistent constraint (key as bridge) is named, yet never shapes tactics under pressure, so the lens holds but the tightening is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    The grotto, atrium, fog, and saxophone are anchored within the first 120 words; spatial orientation stays clean. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each lyrical return of “dewdrops formed” tightens the cadence until the hush lands as Earned Stasis—Elias lowers the horn, the whisper gone, the light softened, a visible cost (his lifelong return). No meaningful reversal inside the scene; the prophecy merely stalls, so it’s a reprieve, not a decisive change. Closure is valid under Accumulative lens, but the lack of a live-option foreclosure keeps it just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each leaf-and-monument cycle adds density until the arbor greens. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—final image of blooming branches reweights the premise with communal cost felt. However, causality is loose; the moonstone speck is discovered by chance and triggers change without resistance or price on Elara. Orientation is clear early; transitions are smooth, but the tightening is lyrical repetition rather than a decisive turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain holds: rumor → greenhouse → key → box → compass → grotto; each because/therefore leap forecloses retreat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass points not to place but to stance, reweighting every prior “broken” object. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the tinkerer’s certainty—but felt on-page when she hangs the compass beside the clocks she’ll no longer worship. The admiral’s carved maps act as persistent constraint, proving the pattern was always bigger than her.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass of heating/mending thickens the symbolic density until the gold-veined coin re-prices the quest from rescue to meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost—the cracked coin forever scarred—landed cleanly in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a tidy release—Lyra dissolves into light—rather than a Decisive Change that costs Elara a live path; the luminous ache lingers but nothing is foreclosed. Causality is linear and complete, yet the single beat of laughter resolves conflict without tightening or surprise, so the resonance feels pre-wrapped. Drive lens is Accumulative; the pattern of “confession → laugh → light” is legible but never deepens or reverses.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s reappearance reweights “ultraviolet penance” from pure suffering to system-break. Causal lens holds: each brace command triggers memory-loop, culminating in the insight that mercy is external to the pain algorithm. Orientation is swift; the grove anchors by sentence three. Cost is felt—“the strap still in his hand”—but the shift from panic to certainty could show more friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the overlooked girl’s story is reweighted, and the lens fragment’s warmth signals felt cost. Causal chain is soft—why this painting, why now, why Elara?—but the accumulative pattern of found fragments holds. Orientation is quick; the market’s ropes and ozone teach the floating rule-set early. One sharpening beat—Elara almost touches Anya but cannot—crystallizes the before/after with elegiac loss.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—he pockets the barrel and drives away—but the cost is asserted, not shown: no foreclosed future, no constraint that will shape tomorrow’s calls. Causal chain is thin: the dust pattern points, he climbs, listens, promises; the ghosts vanish without demanding a renunciation that hurts. Under Causal lens the story progresses by “and-then” more than “because-therefore.”

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost glyphs → type-setting → uncorking → rupture, each stage thickens texture and reweights the library’s stability. The “luminous moment” beat delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost: the library is no longer an archive but a living storm. Orientation is taught early (“glass orchard library floated…”) so no penalty. Closure beat is present, felt, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure (crystal shard projecting holograms) lands as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the past, but the causal chain is fuzzy: we aren’t shown why storm + shard + mirror = vision, only that it does; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern is taught, yet the missing mechanism keeps the cost intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causal chain is clear—chip + honesty → restored light—but the middle act is a single smooth rise with only one reversible hitch (townsman lie). Closure lands as Decisive Change (light returns), yet the cost is off-loaded to the “world” rather than felt by Elian; no constraint or price lingers for him. Orientation is tidy; resonance chamber and covenant rules are anchored by ~120 words and obeyed throughout. The piece meets its own logic but never tightens options for the protagonist beyond “don’t lie.”

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: compass offered, lagoon reweighted, cost legible in “resonant hush” that now holds her. Accumulative lens holds: petrichor motif intensifies from bottled scent to lived presence; the final image reprises “hush” first heard at the cave lip, proving pattern coherence. No teleporting props or causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: slide discovery therefore redirects carving method therefore crystallizes final sculpture; the lantern’s internal light going dark exactly as storm abates supplies the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Spatial anchors hit early (~70 words), no orientation debt; closure image (Elara drives away ignoring GPS) re-weights premise with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers postcards, window light, and seasonal turns until the hidden glass image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by word 80; the single time-jump (winter→spring) is signaled and motivation restated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—moon-flowers as conversation—but the cost is purely contemplative; nothing is foregone or risked, so the “felt” bar is barely cleared. The plot is a gentle spiral, not a tightening; that suffices for this lens but keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: letters → diary → retrocognitive trap → debris cipher → diary decrypted → truth owned. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s quiet “earned stasis” in the zeppelin library forecloses the comfort of sanitized history; cost is the irreversible knowledge she now carries, shown in the final image of her staring at clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bottle’s unopenable seal becomes the town’s new covenant, reweighting the rule-set from magic to merit. Causal linkage holds—each salvage/teach beat is a because/therefore consequence of the spent-wish premise. One scaffold loop (“rejected the false comfort” echoed twice) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative lens is taught early (wax curls, garden whispers) and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s coming silence is re-weighted by the recorded prophecy. Causality is clean—each cylinder layers evidence—yet the decisive cost is off-stage (future silence) rather than an immediate forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portal snaps open with the acorn cap glowing, crystallizing options and felt cost (“a path where past and future intertwined”). Causal chain holds: egg tremor → cap placement → entropy drop → portal. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell replaces the siren, villagers listen, storm met without panic—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (she now bears sole responsibility for silent warnings). Causal chain holds: data → bell pull → preparedness. Orientation anchored by 60 words. One micro-turn suffices; no reversals or rising price keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor passage layers density until the final image re-weights the stake—stillness becomes alive. The glass’s glow, the warming hand, and the “golden pool” on the console act as pattern-teaching repetitions that culminate in a Charged Poise: Kael stands guard, options reconfigured, loneliness now chosen not imposed. Orientation is anchored early (“Shooting Star Tracking Station” by line 2); causality is lyric, not linear, so no causal break. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: he embraces perpetual custodianship of moments, foreclosing any larger cosmic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure succeeds as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the box’s stillness releases the ghosts and re-greenes the oasis, a conceptual repricing with felt environmental cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of ghost gestures, humming hives, and box warmth intensify until meaning reweights; causality is aesthetic rather than plot-turn driven. Orientation is anchored by sentence three; the single shard holds. The missing beat is an on-page price paid by the protagonist—no tangible sacrifice or irrevocable loss is shown, so the ending glows rather than wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of garage-sale clues → urn → equation; each shard adds density until the “melody” re-prices time. Orientation is swift: who/where/when inside 60 words; no debt incurred. Closure is a legit CR: the equation reframes time from countdown to melody, with conceptual cost (old calendars now “lie”). Causality is soft—Leo’s arrival is coincidence—but under Accumulative lens that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the rule. Missing only a visceral, on-body cost at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a gentle Conceptual Repricing: the kite’s ruin becomes a lesson in impermanence, feather tucked behind the ear as charged poise. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each image adds texture rather than narrows options. The lens holds, but the cost is purely contemplative—no tactic is constrained—so the beat stays soft, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the intertwined sketch reconfigures the orchard into a perpetual dialogue that outlives her; the cost is the unspoken forfeiture of any other farewell. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper-wound oak thickens the pattern until the crystalline veins answer back, a visible density shift rather than causal reversal. Orientation is anchored within the first 100 words—Kaelen, caretaker, terminal countdown—so no penalty applies. The diary’s “footnote” is the single exposed exposition patch, but it triggers the entire tactic chain, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram reveals alien and terran pheromones are identical, reweighting the entire premise of “home.” Under Accumulative/Textural lens, each sculpture and dusty footprint incrementally deepens the pattern until the tower crystallizes it. Causality is clean: amber placement → molecular hologram → conceptual flip, no lucky off-stage rescue. Cost is felt in the bronze quiet that follows—knowledge acquired, but no collective embrace, only her glow in an empty valley.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each seed sown and bird call layers density until the jetty’s glow reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—garden launched, concord felt—but cost is only asserted (“battlefield erased”) not dramatized; no tangible price touches the coachman. Orientation is anchored by line 5, transitions are smooth, yet the single forward motion is incremental, not tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coordinates re-weight the leaf from relic to compass, making the distance he sought internal, not bodily. The causal chain is slender—leaf pattern → phonograph clicks → coordinates—but it holds under an Accumulative lens: each loop of sound thickens the texture until meaning crystallizes. Orientation is clean by word 60; no props teleport. Cost is legible in the final image (“the tinted revelation a compass in his heart”), though the price is more poetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal spine holds: anniversary custom → sketch → anomalous star → sensor re-aim → vow to burn engines. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—he abandons post for cosmic north—cost is the forsaken duty, felt when he “turns from the window.” One continuous scene keeps scope tight; orientation anchored by word 50. Minor lapse: star’s unmoving physics never explained, but miracle accepted under SF compact.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the sky bleeds, therefore Kaelen climbs; because he swaps chess pieces and clicks the sundial lid, the heavens re-stitch. Each move tightens options—lose the knight, gain the queen, leave the lid behind—so the final beam carries visible cost: he descends forever changed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt price; lens never wobbles, but the guardian’s near-silence keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pawn-less board flips from emblem of loss to “clean slate,” charged by the spelled “peace” that the gallery echoes back—conceptual cost is the surrender of her exclusive claim on grief. Accumulative lens holds: each spelled word layers density rather than forcing causal turns. Orientation is swift—domed hall, interregnum, walking code—within 60 words. One minor scaffold: “luminous absence” is repeated four times; trimming one instance would tighten the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she touches the stone with the feather, therefore lost languages flow back, therefore she redefines home as pattern not place. Orientation anchors—who/where/when—surface by line 3 and are re-anchored each night-cycle, so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the glyphs rearrange into her image at the center, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (“home was wherever she chose to nurture connection”). Persistent constraint—the stone stays in its niche, her talents now irreversibly awakened—shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore—decoding the border threads literally unlocks the labyrinth, which in turn unlocks self-forgiveness. The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he refuses to stay in the village that absolves him, paying the price of perpetual exile. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One soft patch: “the motivation that had driven him here…blossomed” tells us the emotional shift we already see; a −0.3 line-level slip keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each poem adds density until the hush itself is “forged” into an artifact of meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bell rings, options crystallize, cost felt in the thickened air. Causality is lyric, not causal-linear, so no reversal is required; the pattern taught by 25% and paid off. Orientation anchored by line 3 (who=Elara, where=canyon, when=pre-ritual); no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quilt of memories is permanently lit within Elian’s mind, the charm now glows, and the acid sea remains an ever-present threat—cost is legible. Causal chain holds: key → pockmarks → narrated memories → golden repair. Orientation is complete by word 60. One soft spot: the statue’s sudden crumble feels externally imposed rather than a consequence of his last beat, a micro-teleport rather than earned causal payload.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—cracked mirror → wrong turn → cave → shell reunion → relinquishment—remains linear and legible; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (shell placed back, heart “unburdened”). Orientation is clean by line 3; only one transition (cliff → cave) and it obeys spatial logic. The mirror’s crack is slightly under-exploited as a persistent constraint; once inside the cave its metaphoric work is done, so escalation plateaus rather than tightens again.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causality is clean: heat breaks → climb → uncork → vibration → brother feels pull → return course signaled. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the echo-back “soft echo” reconfigures her stance with tears—cost felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; scent-density and vibration pattern intensify, then cadence-shift at the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when fixed in first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each salvaged fragment tightens the resonator and reweights memory-stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—moon-set dimming of the foot—whose conceptual cost (she alone piloted her sorrow) is legible. The 120-word anchor is met: “hydraulics failed… starlit signal station” grounds who-where-when. One causal micro-turn—Polaris alignment—narrows options cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: because the storm peaks, therefore she hoists the copper cradle; because the bolt strikes, the eye hums, therefore silence blooms. Orientation is swift—storm, ravine, hut within 60 words; no drift. Closure is a Decisive Change: viral compulsion muted, agency restored, with visible artifact (dull eye) and felt price (“unknown cost”). Lens stays causal throughout; no outline beats, no convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lifted fog and pocketed Edelweiss re-weight solitude from emptiness to chosen stewardship. Causal chain holds—each journal gap he decodes deepens his investment until the letter posting becomes inevitable. One soft spot: the stranger’s “Alpine” whisper is accepted too smoothly; no moment where Elias doubts the link between mountain flower and coast. Still, cost is legible: the mailed letter permanently severs his proxy companionship.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage holds: glimmer→chip, ants→crevice, chip→slot, refusal→closure; each therefore narrows possibility. Rising creek works as visible doomsday clock, tightening stakes. The refusal delivers an earned stasis (cost = lifelong ache now consciously shouldered) that satisfies the closure gate. Minor loop: “glimmer” is over-leveraged (×7) without fresh inflection after the midpoint, clipping 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: dream → seer’s warning → solo climb → starlight vision → reversal of purpose. Orientation is nailed in the first 90 words (balcony, dawn, narrow path). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses the option of remaining a detached monarch, signaled by the extinguishing fireflies. The persistent constraint (celestial collapse tied to her realm) is now locked to her reign—cost is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: Kael’s secret → palette shift → shell act → nexus flare. Closure lands—she is “changed,” nexus glowing—but cost is conceptual, not concrete on page. Orientation clean by word 60; single-scene default met. Lens holds as Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lyric-accumulative lens is taught early and holds: each shard adds density to the same stake—how to live after seeing one’s grave—until the final image of the filled scroll reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grave remains, but narrative ownership of it shifts; cost is felt in the ache of the writing hand and the “quiet horror” now framed as story. Orientation anchors cleanly inside 120 words; transitions are signaled by dream logic rather than ellipsis, satisfying Track B mosaic rules.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the screw reweighted from medical to emotional tool, visible in the final line “new way to breathe.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of water/drip images and fog beads accrue to recharge the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words. Causality holds: screw → new practice → client solace shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the platform steadies and she exhales, releasing crystallized doubts with visible conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-linkage—each rune stroke and memory revisits re-weights the crystallization pattern rather than forcing external turns; the final image reconfigures meaning without soft reset. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (floating stone, tea cup, storm perimeter) surface within 120 words and serve the hush payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single apple blossom landing on the sonata page reweights the premise, the word “forgiven” visible as conceptual cost. Causal chain—perfume bottle → induced current → apology → blossom—holds without gaps. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift from minor-key hum to lullaby satisfies. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.8)
    No causal linkage, only recursive restatement: each paragraph re-says “he walked, he read, he unified.” The promised universe-hiccup never perturbs action or options; the library fades because the text says so, not because any choice exhausts it. Closure is a glow, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation drifts: time, space, and bodily position remain foggy past 120 words and the haze never payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the drip-pattern of repeated phrases (“after blowing the whistle,” “razor edges,” “fjord quiet”) accumulates until the final image reweights the premise—clocks measure resistance, not time. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the horizon line blurs, foreclosing the possibility of absolute measurement. Cost is legible in the final sentence—he stands “complete” yet the station is “silent,” the water clocks now indifferent judges.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each pulse of blue light, each beam twist, layers density toward the Conceptual Repricing finale. Orientation anchors inside 50 words; space, time, and permeability taught through immediate action. Closure lands as “system-wide update” that reweights the rule-set: barriers now learn instead of repel; the laser’s lighter heft images the cost of released control. Persistent constraint—the farm’s permeability is permanent—shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly via Conceptual Repricing: the journal reweights probability from “beat the odds” to “live the paradox,” with visible cost—she leaves the library lantern-cold, stance forever altered. Causal chain holds: subway scrawl → library → journal → renunciation. One soft spot: the midsummer anchoring drifts until paragraph 5, but the later payoff waives Orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated loops of story + harmonica tone deepen Elara’s self-recognition while Leo remains the mirror. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final slowed disc reframes estrangement as gift. Cost is present but diffuse—no concrete price is exacted from Leo, so the effect leans faint.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty will be demolished, yet the covenant’s reborn aura reframes loss into continuity. The locket-light payoff is anchored in the first third, returns at exact cost (ink, time, memory bleed), and reweights the premise—stories, not boards, now persist. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of jasmine, salt, walnut ink, and photo essence accrue until the night itself becomes archive. No orientation debt; micro-causality (grandmother’s rescue) seeds the macro turn without outline chatter.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each retelling tightens the reciprocity noose, pattern taught by 25 % and lands with conceptual repricing—“the station becomes a living heart.” Cost is legible in Elara’s vanishing and Leo’s warmed pocket. No orientation debt; ivy-station anchor appears by line 3. Closure beat reweights the premise without exposition. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of ultrasonic detail and musical trail tightens stakes until earth-chord reweights grief. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—stillpoint as Earned Stasis—cost is the irreversible solitude crystallized in the final image. No orientation debt; anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, night of paused stars) land by line 3. One minor scaffold: “the dowsing was a pull in her blood” repeats the ring-pull two sentences earlier (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: mistaken burst → anomaly swells → iterative data queries → reply pulse → calibration signal → hum stabilizes; each step tightens options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “quieting anomaly” is the visible cost, foreclosing the option to ignore the entity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The pen’s final air-trace is the persistent constraint that shapes the last image, satisfying cost proof test. One micro-turn—priority pulse from anomaly—flips her from editor to interlocutor without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian departs carrying the retooled camera and an internalized “silent sonata,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each mapped silence adds density until the dawn fade reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. The advisor’s unexplained arrival/departure is accepted by the lyric pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain—tapestry fragment → curator trail → chamber discovery → promise rescue—tightens neatly; the vandalized portrait map is a sharp pivot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (knowledge must circulate) with felt cost, but the “six months off-grid” anchor arrives late (~140 words) and the Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies because the disorientation never pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each drumming pass layers density until the garden itself sings back, tightening the stake from solitary coping to collective ignition. Closure lands as Charged Poise—universe exhales, dream fades, but lagoon keeps pulsing—cost is the visible exhaustion that follows the light-symphony. Pattern taught early (rhythmic cipher) and paid off. Micro-turn at “universe inhales” reweights possibility without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: storm kills tech → map and gait-skill become crucial → coin and key win Kael → hidden relay proves creed. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “she had proven that whispers… travel farther than shouts,” reweighting the premise with social cost (Kael converted, workers saved). One hairline slip: the key’s metaphor status is declared late, not seeded, so the hinge feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter-light motif thickens the pattern until the water itself becomes a taught galaxy, delivering a Charged Poise closure. Causality is poetic but legible—mirror-angle → new constellation → child-spirit edges upward—so the soft mystery is functional. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral (the dock returns to quiet, guardian still alone), which slightly lowers punch, yet the rule-set is internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the monthly displays seed visible dissent, reweighting civic possibility. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned light images that thicken collective doubt—held cleanly to the final “shared future” glow. Cost is societal, not personal; Elara’s safety is never jeopardized, so the price feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, the story teaches its montage rhythm early and pays it off in the last lit window, satisfying the short-form requirement for one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the island’s sudden solidity reconfigures her entire world, scrimshaw dissolves, and the reader feels the irreversible forfeiture of the shore she leaves behind. Causality is lyrical but coherent—whale-call → bone-warm → island unlock—each because/therefore link tightening options until the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of call, bone, tide, and mist accumulates until the pattern breaks into manifested sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Elara holding the crumbling bouquet crystallizes her impossible stance with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of whittle/narrate/shadow deepens until the hush and dust feel terminal. However, the piece never squeezes her between real alternatives; the stake never tightens, only repeats. One decisive squeeze or forfeiture would push this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lake thaws, fear-based rule-set is re-weighted. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—images and hum deepen until meaning flips. Orientation clear by line 4; one seamless scene. Cost is present but diffused across landscape; lacks a single charged image that makes the price personal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens: because Elian offers silence-with-memory, Maestra demands flawed-source art; therefore the reed awakens. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he gains music, forfeits color fixation, and the vibrating reed makes the cost tactile. One minor slip: the phoenix sunrise is declared catalyst but never loops back to charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mosaic structure (four phased “bell-ring” shards) is taught early and cleanly transitioned with cadence echoes (“each chime a step”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the atrium becomes a living organ, meaning re-weighted, cost felt in the shift from archive to pulse. Causality holds under Accumulative lens; however, the final shard could sharpen the price (e.g., one bell hairline cracks, discarding a timbre forever) to push past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mosaic trail of origami clues teaches an Accumulative pattern early; each find tightens the stake from stasis to renewal. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open curtains and steady star-lamp reconfigure grief from terminus to cycle with undeniable conceptual cost. Only minor slack: the grandfather’s retroactive motive is revealed post-hoc, not seeded as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft flips from refuge to launchpad and the cultural map becomes a “new narrative,” satisfying CR. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—rain, cards, tape accrete meaning until the cloud-break reweights everything. Orientation is fixed within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. The cost is only metaphorical (“inheritance now a guide”), so the beat lands softly, not decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because she seeks forbidden knowledge → therefore approaches pagoda → therefore randomizes motion → therefore purifies atoms → therefore collapses with cost. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she rises “weighted with the cost,” foreclosing return to innocence. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. One minor scaffold: “She felt the weight of centuries” is paraphrased twice; does not touch closure. Cost is legible in final image—saffron veil now badge, not shield.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each “shedding” layer intensifies density and re-weights the stake of compassionate openness vs. self-protection. The final Charged Poise—new tail growing under starlight while she resolves to open the door tomorrow—lands undeniable conceptual cost: continued vulnerability is the price of her vocation. Orientation, causality, and escalation cohere; no prop or knowledge teleport. One sentence of symbolic overtelling (−0.1) is the only bar to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the ivy signals “deep wrong stillness,” therefore Aris tunnels; because he tunnels, he finds the crystal that rewrites his accident. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: his scar shifts from wound to gateway, with the hourglass click as audible cost. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. One clean transition from cot to tunnel; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of emotional relics builds until the cadence shift (“the tune was found…in the act of remembering”) reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara stands in the dim hallway, crystal glowing, guardian of unheard goodbyes—options reconfigured, cost felt as lifelong burden. Causality holds: each psychometric touch → vision → incubation → sworn stewardship. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Only hairline slip: “hushed thunder” metaphor is repeated enough to flirt with loop, but it pays off in final cadence, so cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: stardust→aurora→orrery pattern layers density until the final cadence shift (“In rest, she found endless motion”). Closure is Charged Poise: options re-weighted—she will keep vigil, silence forever stalks her songs—cost is cosmic and unmistakable. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no penalty. No causality gaps; each meteor trace tightens the pattern rather than triggers plot turns, fitting the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeating “charm” beats that brighten sparks and thicken the lullaby cadence until the song smooths. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the chess clock remains frozen, but its meaning flips from prison to promise, reweighting time itself. Causality holds: because she empties herself, therefore the archive yields; because the sparks ignite, the dune breathes. The cost is legible in her accumulating hollowness and the final silence that “makes the world ready.”

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the engine’s restart reweights translocation from curse to dance, cost legible in the tonal shift. Causal chain—gear→slot→machine→mind—is clean; no teleporting props. Accumulative lens holds: each harmonic layer deepens stakes until the cadence shift at the gong. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3, well under the 120-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: each sensory shard adds density until the final moonlit shore reconfigures the stake from “find courage” to “become the holder of courage.” Orientation line 1 gives who/where; transitions legible; no mid-paragraph hops. Closure is Charged Poise: the star glows, the lullaby plays—options re-weighted, cost felt without exposition. No plot amnesia; leash absence stays causally active throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: bolt discovery → archive search → historical secret revealed → refusal to keep silent. The discoloration on the staircase functions as both inciting cue and map-image at the end, tightening the loop. Closure lands as Charged Poise: he stays, silence weaponized, cost felt. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; only the historian’s ledger feels like a mild off-stage convenience, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure lands: the rune activates and Theron’s borrowed majesty “gracefully collapses,” a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost. Causality, however, is front-loaded: the entire plot is seeded before the scene starts; the scholar’s discovery happens off-page and arrives as fait accompli, so the only because/therefore chain the reader feels is Lorian’s final gesture. The Orientation Test is waived—the library’s disorientation is deliberate and pays off in the hush of the ending—so no penalty applies. Still, the missing beat where the scholar’s find pressures Lorian keeps the narrative one linkage short of 8-band tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the atlas page flips from relic of loss to benchmark of renewal, reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost (years of doubt). Causal lens holds—data correlation triggers the change of heart. One minor drag: the “periodically eternal cycles” phrase is repeated without tightening, blunting the final cadence. Otherwise structure is taut, single-scene, with orientation anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum’s spread reweights the rebellion’s future, with Elara rooted at the center, cost signaled by the universe “holding its breath.” Causal linkage is soft—the stone circle’s rules and origin are discovered rather than tested; the lull ends because the hum decides to end it, not because Elara’s agency triggers a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear by line 5; no spatial drift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of graffiti, derelict hulls, twilight—pressure tightens when the hum layers over these relics, recharging their frozen hope.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the embryo dissolves into “visions of possible futures,” reweighting the community’s rule-set from fixed destiny to chosen evolution. Causal linkage holds throughout—because she decodes, therefore she unseals, therefore the council drafts new guidelines. Cost is unmistakable: Elara forecloses a life of mere resistance and accepts lifelong mediator burden. Persistent constraint shapes tactics: every future vision shows her still negotiating, never resting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of return-to-photograph / return-to-grafting tightens the emotional screw until the lighthouse sweep reweights cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options reconfigured, not resolved—visible in the grafted shoot that embodies “memory and future.” Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual price: automated beam = world moves on without tenders. Minor slack: orientation anchor “after the last lighthouse keeper” arrives late (~140 words), nudging −0.2, but the pattern pays off, so no hard cap.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam becomes a guide “through” darkness, reweighting the premise. Causal lens holds—each memory thread tightens options until descent is the only剩余 path. Cost is legible in the phrase “blank pages of a forgotten book,” a literal forfeiture of future commissions. Pattern taught early (torn Magician, split World) pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time-dilation is subjective, a gift of crisis, and this reweights every prior beat with a felt cost—Kael’s solitude is now permanent. Lens is Causal: because he accepts the mental mechanism, therefore he abandons further pursuit. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no debt. The hummingbird data and ink mechanics pay off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the ink always vanishes, mirroring the transient answer he is left with. Cost is legible in the thin smile and wind of “dust and change.”

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she receives the letter, therefore she uploads; because she uploads, the network stirs and the council is scandalized. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“echoing library under snow”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the seed is planted, the conversation begun, cost felt in the “refreshing, cleansing” cold that now frames her exile. One micro-turn—alarm expected, instead a soft chime—tightens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the roses thickens the color and pollen imagery until the final beaming dome reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; anchors (daughter, dome, post-tower desert) land by line 20. Closure is Charged Poise—roses carrying pacifist pollen outward—whose conceptual cost (the farm will be overrun?) is felt but not dramatized. One soft loop: “inculcate plants with values” is iterated six times without deepening mechanics, dulling the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: “journalist’s call → proof-by-contraction plan → drawer opened → contradiction found → public confession typed.” Each step forces the next, tightening options. Closure lands as Decisive Change: she trades silence for testimony, stylus-tap audible in the echoing dome, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s re-leased ancient hush fuses with the forgiven cry, the firmware now croons a lullaby, and Elara’s stance is crystallized with felt cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is intact—each constellation-tattooed silence panel is a therefore-link that cumulatively softens the haunted sound pile-up. One minor orientation wobble: “meteor hush” is introduced before we know we’re inside a lab, but the phrase is swiftly tethered to place and later repaid in the closing image, so the Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush becomes a shared, re-weighted silence whose cost is the mandala’s imminent dissolution. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight “because/therefore,” but the lens is taught early and held. The tile flake’s hum-to-hush progression supplies the decisive reconfiguration; the price is the ephemeral art itself.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the mosaic tessera and stepping-stone patterns accrue meaning until the rename reweights identity. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aeliana stands, sky no longer a wound but canvas, cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Pattern is taught early (shattered sky, warm coldness) and paid off in last line.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo layers density until the orchard itself becomes a proscenium, producing a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s fade into dawn is a Charged Poise where the cost is the irrevocable surrender of ghostly repetition. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the first causal push (coin toss) arrives late; prior stanzas are atmospheric accumulation rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure image is delicate and legible, yet the timeline “snap” is told, not shown, blunting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the finished light-map image crystallizes options (he can keep trying, knowing the bridge is tenuous) with undeniable emotional cost—this reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: pill → somatic recall → light translation → gift of map; each beat adds density. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words. One minor causality fuzz: the geode’s “pulse” is given tiny agency without prior rule cue; since it doesn’t solve the problem, the slip is decorative, not structural.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each heat-map pass layers emotional density until the cave itself glows in sync, a clean pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fossil settles back, the maps now “glow with new clarity,” a crystallized final image that reconfigures meaning without expositional summary. Cost is conceptual—the world now has a voice—visible in the last line. One scaffold loop (“the world after humans hibernated was no longer silent”) slightly dulls the cadence, keeping it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the glowing hourglass reweights the rule-set—fate is now malleable. Causal chain holds: catalog buttons → fray prophecy → golden sands; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“amber warehouse beneath the cliffs”); no debt applied. Persistent constraint is explicit: “her work had only just begun,” a price that shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: snow-code discovery → descent → cabin rendezvous → transmission → wound. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elias bleeds but “the world felt whole again.” One tight scaffold—”the tilt of the earth toward spring” reappears to reweight meaning—justifies the lyric echo. Minor elasticity: the enemy shot arrives with minimal setup, a late coincidence that slightly dilutes prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final silence of the gutters reweights the palimpsest promise into self-forgiveness, the yarn needle now a tool for weaving a new beginning. The accumulative/textural lens holds:each tick-layer thickens the stake until the silence pattern-breaks the mood. Cost is legible in the image of the lifted fog revealing the path. Minor orientation drift: “gloom-hill coachman” is poetic but geographic anchor waits until ~word 80; waiver applies because the fog-bound river crossing teaches the disorientation that is paid off when the fog lifts at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kindness-lantern accretes meaning until the final glow reweights the oasis. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lantern lifted, fractures mended “for a fleeting instant,” cost felt as transient fragility. Causality between ghost-scenes and present calm is more associative than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and lands cleanly; slight looseness keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each oar-stroke layers calm, the mirror-beam re-weights the same dark cliff, and the rose-petal frame returns as Conceptual Repricing—loss is re-priced as invitation. Causality is loose (no lock actually resists her) but the pattern is taught early and closure lands with luminous cost. Orientation is secure by line 4; transitions are smooth within the single contiguous window.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces downward life, accepting endless custodianship; cost is the lifelong weight of ghost-presence made explicit in the final image. Causal lattice holds—sundial glows only when circle hums, hum arises only when she steps in, so the renunciation is mechanically inevitable. Orientation is clean inside 60 words; no lens ambiguity; time/space stay anchored. One hairline slip: “progress of her spirit” is slightly diagnostic, but it occurs after the irrevocable choice, so penalty is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each added reed strand thickens the secret-density until the final image reweights the premise—vulnerability itself becomes the connective thread. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lily pond, post-storm). Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral pulses with shared confessions, foreclosing her ghost-writing mask. Cost is legible in the shedding of skin she “did not know she wore.”

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: because the town fractures, therefore Aris risks the illegal burst; the closure is a clean Charged Poise—station is now weapon, Evans’s grudging respect the visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the spatial chaos stills, her fear recedes, starlight brightens—cost is the endurance of terror now legibly paid. Causality, however, is soft: the compass correlates “points with resonant frequencies” off-page; the keeper supplies the key instead of Elara discovering it. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear within 50 words, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the organ’s cadence layers density until the pattern break brings stasis—legible but not tactically driven.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each opposition (masquerade glitter / quarry brutality, ribbon finery / granite violence) layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the ribbon as portrait of a relationship—crystallized in the last sentence (“she could draw the story”). Cost is legible: Elara forfeits the certainty of identity and embraces the ambiguity of relation. No causal gap; pattern taught early (“unifying opposites”) and paid off in final charcoal stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: coded stanzas → coordinates → dive → nail → exoneration, each link visible on-page. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost (ancestral shame reversed). One soft spot: the false-mutiny reveal is delivered in a single expository lump instead of being discovered through tightened choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final note reconfigures despair into gateway possibility, cost signaled by the lingering “golden haze” and the pocketed shard. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each flutter, reflection, and note layers density until the stance shift crystallizes. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The only drag is a mid-section loop where “sculpting possibility from the ashes of never” is restated three times, slightly dilating momentum before the fiddle rise.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat links “because/therefore” from startup failure → train pilgrimage → warning the squatter → leaving. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of stepping onto unmarked ground reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clean by 60 words; only slip is late-exposition of father’s hiding method that slightly delays stakes. No teleporting props or broken chains.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page: the whispered name “Morwen” decisively reweights the curse and Elara’s stance. Causal chain holds: failed illusion → frozen confession → seed ritual → truth released → vortex stilled. Orientation is clean within 60 words. One minor elasticity slip: the seed’s “hunger” is introduced as world-rule only at the moment it is used; still, the rule is paid off in the same beat, so the lens stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: images (cobalt hue, clipping, roots, blood) accrete until the final crystallization. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—roots loosen into bridges of light, covenant re-lit, felt cost visible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before word 120 and spatial logic tracks throughout. One causal micro-turn—portal opens because she blood-activates the clipping—suffices for this length; no outline-like “and-then” strings appear.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the card swallowed by fresh roots reconfigures meaning with visible cost—she renounces control. Accumulative lens holds: each bone-and-root image tightens the emotional density until the final weave. Keeper’s warning functions as pattern-break that shifts her from forcing to listening; causality intact. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3, corridor glow recurs as clock.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    Causal chain is thin: yesterday’s public failure → today’s brooding → Mara’s visit → instant pivot. Closure is a declared intention, not a visible trade-off; no persistent constraint or price shapes the final image. Orientation is clear, but the decisive change happens in narrative summary, not on-page action. Drive lens is situational, yet pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: every magnetic pulse and seed-glow is a because/therefore trigger that tightens options until the final re-lattice act locks Elian into earned stasis. The closure—“stones aligning perfectly” with “eternal pulse”—visible reconfiguration of the arbor’s ontology, carries conceptual cost: he can now read transitions but never follow them. Orientation anchor is present by line 3; no teleporting props. One persistent constraint shapes tactics: only resonant alignment, not force, allows passage, and this rule governs both spirit and seed.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each identity-smelting beat layers a denser pattern of reconciled contradiction, culminating in the charged poise of the swaying creel. Orientation is immediate; the moon–tide loop is taught by line 3 and reprises at closure. The only missing cost is personal—Elian is never threatened, so the resonance is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    A single continuous scene under the Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via density of confessions and the final light release. Orientation is immediate. The pearl placement is the decisive Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights meaning of bunkers and his vocation; cost is felt in the “walls dissolve” moment. No causal reversals are needed under the lyric/accumulative mode; the intensification is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final note reweights the whole map of regret without spoken absolution. Causal lens holds: because she reads the graffiti, therefore the accordion can be played again—air-and-water music becomes the new route. Cost is legible in the patched bellows and sunset bleeding over the platform—permanent visible price of carrying failure forward. Orientation anchors (ivy station, dusk, men’s bathroom) are fixed by word 80; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the entrance shimmer threatens erasure, Elara recalibrates via her own echo, and the library admits her—Charged Poise with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each propagation-delay measurement directly toggles her position relative to the reversing cipher. One soft patch: “the symbols cyclically reversed” is told, not shown, breaking immediacy for a beat. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the violin liquefies, seeds take flight, and Empire control is foreclosed with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: telepathy → plant urgency → coffee-stain prophecy → bow-stroke → propagation. Orientation is clean by word 60; velvet observatory midsummer heat is anchored through sweat and weeping ice. One minor causality gap: how seeds “across the continent” are audible to her at the instant of playing—treated as lyric license and does not rupture the lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the hairpin’s glow reveals the alcove and her decision to teach others, reweighting the rebirth rule-set with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: repeated scallop/tree climbs thicken the pattern until the glow breaks it; no single because/therefore turn, but the tightening lands. Orientation arrives by line 5; one scaffold loop (“vineyard hush” x3) dulls momentum yet doesn’t touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara stands in the dawn wearing doubt, options re-weighted, cost legible in her lighter heartbeat. Causal lens holds: shard → cloak → sea-view sequence tightens because/therefore links. Wind-chime pattern is taught early and paid off in final cadence. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ripple-pattern taught early, retuned at closure (“we are all patterns in the pond”). One smooth shard—platform drift—anchors who/where within 50 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael’s reappearance reweights self/whole separation with felt cost (“sharp and clear”). Persistent constraint—grotto’s magnetic pull—shapes every beat; no outline sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the humming of the towers anchors the wandering pulse in a resonant reconfiguration that makes “navigation without motion” legible. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than strict because/therefore; the flock-to-arrowhead linkage is taught early and paid off, so the lens holds, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights the spire’s reality, giving the ending undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain, however, is slack: the keystone’s power is told-not-shown, and the leap from “keystone accommodates impossibilities” to instant verdant transformation is unearned. Orientation is clean; who/where is anchored in first 90 words. One shard/one transition default met; no mosaic or multi-POV issues.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: lantern release → key find → dive → orb melody → color synesthesia; each because/therefore tightens options until the final silent vow. Orientation anchors cleanly inside 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last paragraph re-prices his lamplighting from job to priesthood, with conceptual cost—he is now “keeper of sensory truths,” a life-sentence. Persistent constraint (color in every flame) is visible in the final image; lens stays Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of casting → static decoding → memory dive → map coins; each beat thickens texture and reweights stake. Closure is Charged Poise: “She aligned her wavelength… beacon of hope” crystallizes options with cosmic cost. Orientation, causality, and transition clean; no prop or knowledge teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crystallized echo on the floor re-weights his duty from endless repetition to named stewardship. The price is the irreversible fixity of memory—he can no longer “lose” her because the shards will not fade. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: every refracted beam thickens the density of memory until the final cadence shift (“quiet acceptance” replacing “nameless dread”) is inevitable. Persistent constraint—the atlas page he rolls away with—literally carries the new map; its monsters are now guardians, proof the rule-set has changed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: “because river died → therefore fix bell; because drip rate learned → therefore spell lands.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no penalty. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—fatigue, bleeding, prior mockery vindicated—visible in the kneeling, dawn-breaking image. One minor loop: “rebuilt the bell…and in doing so rebuilt hope” is paraphrase; doesn’t blunt closure but keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal spine is discover-photo → gather crowd → speak: a single turn that lands cleanly but late. Orientation is clear within 120 words; however, the inciting cause (why photos appear tonight) is left to coincidence, softening the because/therefore tension. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community embraces the exposed past—yet the decisive moment is summarized (“they decided to expunge the silence”) rather than dramatized, so the cost is acknowledged but not viscerally felt. The lens holds, but the tightening beat is narrative summary, not pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via prismatic sensory layering and holds through the final image; the Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the liquefied crystal re-colors the orchard, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—no causal zigzag needed for this lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: static ceases → therefore she must re-analyze → therefore invents hybrid protocol → therefore transmits validated event. Single scene, orientation anchored by word 50 (“isolated post… above the clouds”). Closure is Charged Poise: the coherent celestial pattern reweights her solitude into watchtower pride; cost is the unabating isolation felt in the glinting buckle. No teleporting props; parachute buckle set up, reused, and reprised in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael is numb, therefore he seeks merger; because merger proceeds, history stabilizes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 60 words and are re-anchored at each new floating-stone arrival. One clear transition (Rin guiding him to the edge) is motivated and legible. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the brain stirs, emotions flood, timeline locks—cost is the unrecoverable ego-death stasis he surrenders.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: seed arrival → orthogonal ideation → new room concept → safeguard business. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—seed reframed from threat to sanctuary cornerstone—visible in “She would design a room where players must nurture the seed to ‘bloom’.” Orientation clear by line 3; no teleport props. Mild causality gap: corporate threat is recalled, not foregrounded, so cost is intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens declared by the echo-tunnel’s taught pattern and held to the last whisper. Closure is a Charged Poise: the household’s laughter returns tinged, the Conductor dissolves, and the cord cools—felt cost legible in the bittersweet tonality. Orientation anchored by word 20 (“echo chamber tunnel”); no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the giggles pierce only after sonic sorrow is fully macerated. The cost is not declaimed but acoustically priced: every new laugh carries an audible ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: pendant shatters, boundaries dissolve, guardian becomes the uncertainty—cost is the irreversible loss of dimensional home. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each “interiorizing exteriors” beat thickens the mist/light density until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (who, where, when). The slight bump: causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but that is chosen lens; still, the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: every alchemical beat is a because/therefore link—silver for conductivity, blood for personal conduit, final surrender causes re-assembly. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the crozier breathes, destiny ruptures, and the ember nexus flares in visible approval. Orientation anchors by word 40; no teleporting props. Only hairline slip: “penny dropped” is used twice, slightly cheapening the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: because the charts fail, therefore she discards the loud-signal assumption, which triggers the attenuation move that lands the tone. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moon recedes but the silence-tuning insight is now an irreversible perceptual asset; cost is the forfeiture of ever again hearing the cosmos as noise. Lens holds accumulative → causal shift without wobble; only a trace scaffold repetition (“serenely electric” ×3) keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: grotto dissolves, ferry rematerializes, cost is the loss of the pocket-realm. Causal chain—hourglass angles + radio voices → pattern alignment → merger—holds throughout. Orientation is anchored within 40 words; lens is causal. Only nitpick: “permanent transient” is named, not dramatized, slightly softening the conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry’s eruption is not quelled but re-channelled into a living forest of mutable memories, and Elara’s recognition “she was the connection” crystallizes a new conceptual rule-set—she can no longer be a passive observer of her past. The cost is undeniable and on-page: “Memories of her childhood surfaced, but they were distorted… she couldn’t recall if the gallery had always been her home.” Cause-and-effect holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each pass of the sinew tightens both pattern and self-revision, leading inexorably to the moment the loom rewrites her. Orientation is taught early (gallery rules, shifting walls) and ambiguity about “always been there” pays off thematically at closure. No loop or artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: alien-contact rupture → curriculum redesign → Kael’s catalyzed curiosity → Elara’s crystallized stance. Closure is Charged Poise: hologram fades, she grips chain, ocean reconfigured as runway—conceptual cost legible ("prison" becomes "launchpad"). No orientation debt; who/where established by sentence 3. One soft risk: off-page alien details never tighten pressure here, but since pedagogy is the real antagonist, the ellipsis is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mist-pulse layer tightens the hush until the photograph warms, delivering a Charged Poise with felt cost—Eleanor’s dissipation reweights Elara’s vocation; no orientation debt; sole soft spot is that the奶奶 lore block arrives late and summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the codex alignment releases ghost-researchers, reweighting Elara’s personal grief and the facility’s history with undeniable conceptual cost (“they were no longer alone”). Causal chain holds—codex → hologram → safe path → core chamber → tidal deadline; each phase transition narrows time/space options. One soft spot: the “crashing hush” metaphor is repeated without deepening; luckily it never touches the final image. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: she stops counting, drawer-shuts the shard, and the observatory brightens—an Earned Stasis with felt cost under Accumulative lens (ink patterns re-weight meaning). Causality inside the defragment sequence is montage-style memory, not because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“ephemeral patterns in spilled ink”) and pays off in the final image, so lens holds. Radio-static anchor appears ~word 60 and pays off at end, satisfying Orientation Test. One minor slack: the system error that listed her dead is asserted, never shown or re-encountered, so the external stakes feel inherited rather than re-proven on page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the moment her voice surrenders to the starling pattern, the tunnel’s layered time re-weights silence itself, leaving the reader with the audible cost of harmonizing with a curse. Causality is causal-to-lyric hybrid: bird-flight → tunnel mouth → diamond test → mimicry, each beat foreclosing a safer option. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt. Lens holds from first echo to final throb. The last image—her voice rising/falling like wings—makes the conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s gravity-dance and thawing hope reconfigure stakes with felt cost—Aris pockets a now-alive relic, foreclosing undercover objectivity. Causal chain (arrowhead → gravity shift → metamorphose) holds; one minor ellipsis—how confessions travel through cracked phone—is accepted under lyric license. Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: locust shell → heartbeat idea → crystal dies. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (statues uproot, crystal light dies), satisfying the lens. However, the heartbeat method is recalled rather than discovered in-scene, so the pivotal tactic arrives via exposition, not pressure. Orientation is fine; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causal chain is thin: the drone arrival feels coincidental, not forced by Elian’s prior moves, so the climax lacks a because/therefore punch. Orientation is clear by word 50, but the reflective block (≈25 % of text) halts momentum and the promised “lone mail drop” clock never tightens options. Closure reaches for Charged Poise—hush “full of potential”—yet the cost is asserted, not felt; no constraint persists to shape next-day tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the once-silent man sings, the halo glows steady, the train becomes cradle not tomb—cost is felt in the broken silence and glowing fragment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet→sound→light reweights stakes. No orientation debt; space/time anchored early. Persistent constraint (his silence) shapes tactics until the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each hyperbolic trace thickens the library’s uncanny atmosphere until the wall ripples into a literal doorway; the Charged Poise closure (narrative constellations swirling around her) reweights “solitude” into communion without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream image crystallizes, then dissolves into sunrise, leaving Elara in Charged Poise—loss acknowledged, yearning re-weighted. Cost is legible in the spent palette and the “gentle radiance” that replaces luminous absence. Causal chain holds: each brushstroke of light tightens the possibility of capture until the shutter click forecloses pursuit. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present: the lock accepts the hair, reality warps, the idea is freed—an Earned Stasis that costs Elian nothing we feel. Causality is poetic rather than tight: the star-hint is received, but the archway, keyhole, and disorientation appear without prior setup, so the turn feels conjured. Orientation is waived because deliberate disorientation is the method, yet the story still leans on ad-hoc magic instead of taught pattern. The result is a lyrical Event, not a causal chain whose price the reader can trace.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each mushroom nudge triggers haze fragments; final alignment restores memory and literally raises the water level—physical consequence of psychic act. Closure lands with Decisive Change + felt cost (water recedes, ships groan). Orientation clean within 120 words. One micro-turn: pattern from broken to restored constellation. No lens ambiguity; payoff taught early. Could push 9+ if cost were sharper (e.g., bodily bleed or permanent liminal mark).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Situational lens: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization. The swing’s creak → hush → silence acts as a live metronome that narrows options until Elian’s annotation becomes the single available act of agency. Closure is a Charged Poise: the archivist walks forward for the first time, paying the visible cost of her own nerves now transferred to the annotated shard in Elian’s hand. No causality breaks; every beat either lifts knowledge or forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: gray malaise → cross-world harvest → seed-planting → color return, each step legible under a Causal lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard renewed, Elara already turning to the next task, the waterfall’s endless flow indexing perpetual obligation—felt cost is the endlessness itself. No orientation or set-up lapse; anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 60 words. One minor slack: the “gray malaise” is declared rather than shown collapsing a leaf on the page, a thin motivation hinge that keeps it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the net’s last sigh reframes the sanctuary’s glow. Causal chain is thin—unraveling knots = freeing spirits—but the rule is stated early and held. No cost touches Elara; the price is off-loaded to absent spirits, keeping the beat below high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn map finds its whole counterpart on the chapel wall, reweighting known/unknown with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—shifted stones and widened crack are observed rather than provoked—but the pattern is taught early and the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow-globe image reweights her life-rule from hoarding to releasing, with “Peace” as audible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned returns of ‘tangle / untangle’ and ‘snow-settle’ deepen stake rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by line 4; transitions are handled within one continuous descent-ascent window; no meaningful escalation break, only a single cadence shift, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mosaic pattern taught early—graffiti as encode ritual—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each pigment layer adds density until ghost manifestation reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard hums with “resonant hum,” stories hang in air, options reconfigured—readers feel the cost of eternal exposure even though Elara loses nothing tangible. One transition (storm’s approach) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. Lens ambiguity at midpoint is minor; final image clarifies the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: joy = transformed anguish, cost felt in the captain’s sacrificed crew. Accumulative lens holds: each floor thickens thematic density rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 40 words; single-scene default met. No reversal or narrowing of options—pressure plateaus rather than tightens, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cloud entry thickens the memorial texture toward a Charged Poise finale. Yet the piece misses a meaningful tightening beat; stakes never escalate past the initial drift, so the closure carries概念ual rather than felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and fractal recursion intensifies density until the mural’s static beauty itself proves the sky can’t be possessed. The “click” of the safe and the coin-alignment are tidy micro-turns that pay off the guild legend without breaking causality. Closure is a Charged Poise: she steps back, brush still wet, as the first demolition rumble reweights all prior effort into conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clean: murmuration → luminance → hopscotch cipher → coordinates → course change, each beat causally triggered by the previous. Closure lands as Decisive Change with light cost (the luminance fades, the birds disperse), satisfying the lens. However, the hopscotch board appears only at the 75 % mark—too late to shape earlier tactics—so the turn feels engineered rather than foreshadowed; still, no causality break occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: “every broken thing held a beat waiting to be restored” reweights prior motifs under the Accumulative/Textural lens, and the cost is the ache of accepting time’s fractures, but this is only implied, not dramatized. Causality is lyric rather than tight— prophecy → gear → uncap → vision—each step accepted without resistance or complicating obstacle, so the tightening is poetic accumulation, not rising risk. The Orientation Test is cleanly passed by line 4; spatial and temporal anchors stay legible throughout the library ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: chalk → bell → nebula → bloom; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“The garden grows”) that reweights hope from bramble to vine. The Orientation Test is waived—floating-arch weirdness is taught by 5% mark and pays off in the glowing mineral pulse—so no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt spikes at “we’re following a ghost based on sidewalk scribbles,” forcing Elara’s dawn recommitment; cost is the irreversible energy spend and the ghost’s own disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is crystalline: cracked head → hollow note → lullaby → mending glow → clock’s final toll. Each gear adjustment tightens the universe’s last breath, landing in a Conceptual Repricing where the lighthouse fades but the song retroactively blankets all time; the cost is her life, paid on the page (“gave everything she had”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: inherited curse → hears cries → assembles nut-device → projects arrows → family escapes before frost. Closure is Charged Poise: “broken, beautiful song” reweights orchard bond with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 70; no teleporting props. One soft spot: blueprint’s “offhandedly exact” trait could be motivated earlier; slight causal thinning but doesn’t break chain.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single causal spine—grief → ravine → foam insight → lab rebirth—lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the chrysalis release). The piece teaches its pattern early and keeps the therefore/because links clear; no teleport or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early—gaps, silence, absence—and the prose keeps circling that motif; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the empty vial reframes the earlier quantifying obsession. Causality is loose: the library “responds” without internal logic, the doorway appears as a lyrical given, and the return to customers is told in future-planned summary rather than dramatized choice. Still, the final image reweights the premise—absence is generative—and the pattern holds across 780 words with one clean transition.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “remembrances made smooth” reweights the premise so stored remorse becomes edible wisdom rather than prison. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal-pool imagery and iterative “subsume” acts intensifies stakes until the coral bonds melt. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4. Causality is intact: rain → reveals pavilion → touch → grief transfer → chef transforms it. No meaningful tightening beyond the single absorption act, so escalation is mild; cost is felt but not dramatized as lost option—hence 7.8 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a tidy group-hug: clock fixed, villages harmonized, no individual cost or foreclosed path. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—starlight, choral song, and “grain elevator talk” motifs layer toward feel-good cadence—but the final image reweights nothing; tension evaporates in celebratory cliché. The chain repair is narrated, not dramatized, so the decisive physical act is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each refracted color layers density rather than causal chain, tightening until the canyon walls sing with borrowed dreams. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara stands as living archive—whose conceptual cost (she now carries orphaned hopes) lands cleanly on the final image. One scaffold loop (“chaotically precise gestures” repeated) slightly dulls the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single causal chain—manuscript doodle → threshold navigation → seeds discovered—holds cleanly to the charged-poise ending. Anchors who/where set by line 3; no orientation debt. One significant tightening: crossing the final archway under repelling force costs her “previous self” (renunciation legible). Closure reconfigures meaning rather than action: seed-patterns enter Elara, the outer world unchanged but her stance crystallized; cost is the internalized vigilance she can never switch off. All set-ups (doodle brightness, seed concept, gravity clock) pay off in the vault image; no outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the first note rewrites the world’s acoustic rule-set and Elara’s own purpose, cost visible in the porcelain’s new vibrational load. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each crack read adds density until the single-string release—but the hedgehog hinge is slightly under-cued as the pattern’s primer, creating a hairline delay in orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant “breathes again” and Kael’s hope is re-priced, the cost registered in the physical jolt he endures. Causal chain holds: basalt gift → remembered pact → nexus correlation → ritual fit → partial restoration. Orientation is taught early (who/where/when by line 3). One minor scuff: the text never risks showing a failed correlation, so the turn feels mildly predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is legible: because she tuned frequencies, the clasp clicked; because she read silence, she renounced spectacle. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she foregoes the fireworks’ noise and embraces the silence of fulfillment—charging the final image with conceptual cost. Orientation is prompt: within 50 words we have who, where, when. One soft spot: the diary’s “hidden mechanism” is introduced only at the moment it yields, so the rule feels convenient rather than pre-seeded, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed cracks as Elara’s stance flips from control to harmony, reweighting the village’s shared belief system. Causality is accumulative/textural: repeated scent micro-shifts accumulate until the pattern break (wet-stone aroma) coincides with her internal flip. The 120-word anchor test is passed by line 5; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the final hush—her ambition thorn is replaced by patient motion—making the tide-turn literal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clear: inversion → drift → arrow find → echo chamber → knowledge gained, each beat because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arrow tip becomes “symbol of connection” and Kaelen’s mandate to “share this discovery” forecloses retreat with social cost implied. Orientation anchors within 120 words; lens holds. Minor slack: the arrow’s exact causal trigger of the echoes is asserted rather than shown, a hairline break.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patch becomes vigilance, silence becomes warning, and Elias’s walking away carries the felt cost of bearing future disasters. Causality is clean—wind survey → pattern recognition → convergence understood—under an Accumulative/Textural lens whose density tightens at the final image. One minor scaffold: “the silence felt different” repeats the opening beat sans new pressure. Orientation is secure by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amber sheet clears and the cavern silence is “forever altered,” a legible before/after. Causality is soft—aurora + sculptor’s chime arrive as coincidence—yet the pattern is taught early and holds under an Accumulative lens; cost is present but diffuse (the relic is spent, the hush is filled).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the driftwood trail and lighter flute reweight meaning with felt cost, under an Accumulative/Textural lens where silence and markers accrue. Orientation is anchored by word 50, causality is clean, and the single portal transition is legible. The absence of an externalized constraint beyond self-judgment keeps it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held: aurora, pendant hum, traveler’s mythic speech layer density rather than cause tight linkage. Closure is Charged Poise—pendant’s steady hum re-weights the relic’s meaning—but cost is conceptual, not felt. Orientation clear by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: traveler’s speech deepens stakes from “tedious job” to “carrier of stories,” but traveler exits without testing Kaelen’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story teaches its accumulative pattern early—each frost vision layers residue—then tightens into the self-portrait reveal that reweights the premise. The closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s new emotional mass is felt without exposition. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image crystallizes options rather than resolving plot. One minor scaffold: “shifted hush” is named three times in 80 words near the open; trimming one would polish.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens: each weaving pass physically thins her (“a piece of her own vitality seeped into the loom”) therefore the final step-into-light is inevitable. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes the bridge, Liam feels the warmth, the orchard re-blooms—cost is the disappearance itself. Orientation anchor arrives by line 4 (who, where, when), well under the 120-word allowance. Minor waiver: the jigsaw-to-portal mechanic is exposited more than demonstrated, but the bead’s flare supplies the decisive visual trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain (find silk → trade → alloy → symbolic blade) is legible and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the blade reweights “rubble” as strength. Orientation is swift; the floating orchard arches anchor place within 60 words. Escalation is single-tier—knowledge gained, no new obstacle—so pressure feels moderate, not tightening. Closure beat carries visible cost: the forge’s late-night glow externalizes the price of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    One clean shard—dock ascent to lantern room, descent to cove, return—held under Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “light/failure” tightens the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam revives with the glass anchor visible, reweighting safety as shared vigilance; cost is the perpetual return of the haunt. Orientation anchored by word 30. Causality intact: cairn mechanics foreshadowed in earlier letters motivate Elian’s action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ascent/lens-tweak intensifies the glow-pattern density toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands—“the world felt poised”—with conceptual cost (storms must destroy to renew). Orientation is clear by line 4; however, “ancient shadows” remain nebulous rules, clipping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.7)
    Tight accumulative design under a situational lens: each sun-trail adds texture until the wing’s dusting reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—wing turns to dust, reweighting beauty’s cost—but the causality is ambient, not driven by a decisive protagonist act. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. The lack of a visible cost-bearing choice keeps the closure effect muted.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sextant’s re-weighting and the sorrow’s dissolution are legible, and the final image carries felt conceptual cost. However, causality is loose—“the pin’s sound had been a catalyst” is asserted, not dramatized—and the dream-mapping mechanic is introduced late, so the because/therefore chain is more associative than causal under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 8; no penalty. The lens holds, but the tightening beat is off-stage (the pin clink) and therefore less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared in the opening image of “fragile lattice” and held: each repetition of song and thread thickens the dawn-light until the final refulgence. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the realm’s night recedes not by accident but because the communal song saturates the mica window and reconfigures the world’s very lighting-rule. Cost is palpable in Elara’s cracked voice and the prior “endless night” stillness; the last sentence crystallizes options—memory now coherent, realm now morning-lit—without dissolving tension. Only a trace orientation debt: “mirror world” is named before its logic is taught, but the greenhouse perimeter keeps the scene anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hidden-door reveal and midnight ritual deliver a coherent situational arc: pressure forces stance crystallization rather than causal dominoes. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 50, satisfying orientation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crumpled invitation re-weighted from summons to talisman, the cost felt in the expanded calm. However, the absence of a persistent constraint or price that shapes later tactics keeps the reconfiguration more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory particular (geese absence, bread heel, marble seam) layers density until the journal reweights the entire stake—impermanence vs. witness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty sky is re-seen as space for noticing; cost is felt in the phrase “her work was just beginning,” which forecloses rest. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“southern hills”), spatial choreography clean throughout. No causal breaks; even the hidden journal is seeded by her patient gardening act that literally uncloaks it. One hairline slip: the final beat could use a sharper sensory tick to make the cost viscerally audible rather than conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sampled frequency adds density until the final cadence shift—”meaning endured, etched into the records”—reweights the stake from rescue to witness. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the library’s sigh and the stored slide crystallize options ( preservation chosen over intervention) with felt cost. Causality is internal and steady; no external antagonist is needed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is clean: false starts → Silas relaxes → she witnesses the slap that audibly fractures trust. Orientation is anchored by line 7; the watch-fob “sound-capture” conceit is taught early and paid off when it “hums” at the moment of betrayal. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fob now carries the conceptual cost of broken trust and Elara’s complicity, foreclosing any naive loyalty to the market world. One minor causality seam: the revenue agent’s instant physical violence feels slightly convenient, a compressed turn rather than an earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story teaches its speculative rules early and cleanly: compass tastes, weather-carriers, forest elections. Causality holds: each compass quiver prompts her downhill, the man’s explanation retroactively justifies the anomaly, and the final hum/aurora flare is a satisfying CR that reweights the premise. Cost is present but diffuse—mostly conceptual—so the closure grazes rather than punches. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) remains coherent and the ending image lands.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken lock left behind crystallizes the cost of her new stance. Causal linkage holds—cave → painting → note → combination → creative torrent—each beat advances knowledge or options. The “auroral sorrow” final image reweights earlier pain without explanatory sermon. Minor lapse: gallery mockery is reported, not shown, so the inciting pressure is second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain intact: fragment discovery → map assembly → archive console keyed by same fragment → hearing stored voices → decision to re-inscribe. Each step tightens options; the postal plate as skeleton key binds set-up to payoff. No teleporting props; the zinc shard is handled early, mid, late. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she turns back into danger carrying the archive’s light, cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural pattern—seasonal fade → bell calibration → prismatic bloom—holds cleanly; each paragraph layers sensory density until the final cadence recharges the opening image. Closure is a Charged Poise: the iceberg fragment flashes, wonder color brightens, and Elara’s silence becomes listening; the conceptual cost is that she must repeat this ritual each autumn forever. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, so the tightening is cadence-based, not option-based, satisfying the lens. The piece teaches its pattern early and lands it without contradiction, meeting the 9− threshold for an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “static,” “burn,” “miniaturize” deepens density until the cadence snaps at the silent flame exit. The final Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael stepping through glass that melts without shattering—crystallizes stakes and reweights nostalgia into lightweight burden. Cost is legible in the carved hole and the forever-lost dome; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: finding the locket (inciting) → courtyard testimony → locket key → mailbox → letter read. Each link narrows options and raises emotional cost; the sealed clasp and rusted literalize the psychic lock. Closure lands with visible cost when Hemlock’s tear and smile reconfigure his future stance; the courtyard’s “dawn serenity restored” is a Charged Poise image that reframes Elara’s theory and the neighborhood’s shared memory. No orientation debt; geography and chronology stay clean.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dice symbol of “release” reweights the entire premise—vulnerability becomes the unforgeable key. Causal chain holds: dice roll → cipher layer → stasis release; each step narrows options with visible cost (time, oxygen, guilt). The “mysterious familiarity” motif tightens into the final image, paying off early disorientation. No teleporting props; the dice state is tracked perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: whale → gravity warps → coffee map → dig → jar → memory return, each adding density until the final gravity collapse reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the floating jar moment makes the cost of recovered grief legible without exposition. Orientation is clear by 70 words; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece layers refrains (“whispered secrets,” “smoothed hush”) until they crest in the final veil. Causality is thin—no beat shows the prophecy actually endangering anything—yet the cadence shift from murmur to silence lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the world’s balance is now dependent on Elian’s vigil, a price felt in the closing “for now.”

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the brass seal passes from ghost to living keeper, a conceptual repricing that permanently reframes the city as text. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each meteor-steeped tea layers the lexicon until the final silence can speak. The orientation waiver is earned—deliberate disorientation (transparent hand, celestial dissolve) pays off in the last image. One soft spot: the narrator’s decision to accept the mantle is summarized in a single clause; the beat is present but not pressured, so the cost is felt atmospherically, not tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s dawning light reweights her stance and forecloses retreat; the cost is the seashell’s silence—felt on the page. Causal linkage is tight: shell → memory → resonance archive → freedom. One transition (twilight to dawn) is legible and tied to the star-time cue. No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the invisible air-seam cut and thorn-left-behind image reweight guilt without a felt bodily cost. The causal chain is thin—thorn glows because she bleeds, but no prior rule teaches why blood activates it—so the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, not fully causal. Orientation is clear; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Kaelen’s song reframes the nexus, exposing false echoes—an earned conceptual repricing with felt melancholy cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each sung note thickens pattern until true echoes drown false ones; no contradictions. Orientation (who/where/when) is vague early, but the lyric mode teaches disorientation as mood, waived at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glacier candle → dream shards → melted globe reprise tightens meaning rather than plot. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the warped globe becomes a beacon of love, not ruin—whose conceptual cost (Elias’s life traded for symbol) is legible in the final image. One soft spot: the dream-harvest method is told twice in near-paraphrase, a micro-loop that slightly dulls the last third’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the whisk and whistle re-weight everyday labor into sacred pattern. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than dramatic; each image layer deepens the thesis instead of narrowing options. Orientation is swift, transitions are smooth, and the final hut beat loops cleanly to the parapet epiphany, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: rumor → arrival → confetti → reassembly → tree code → diamond → activated sphere. The “stillpoint = orchard” turn is seeded by growth-ring numbers and geometry observations, paying off with Conceptual Repricing: the liquidation was deliberate reset to bury this secret. Closure shows visible cost (activating sphere trades life energy; dust already returning), satisfying Cost Proof test under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm-static and radio crackle accrete until the cobalt canopy reprise reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara on the crowd’s edge, sky washed clean, cost legible in her “quiet hope” and forfeited tower. Causality is clean: the unity broadcast triggers descent; betrayal threat tightens council stakes; final canopy homage crystallizes options. One scaffold loop—“the rise of the prophet was complete, but her work…was just beginning”—is forgivable at the coda.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the semicircle of glowing jars reweights his identity from vagrant to “keeper,” with the conceptual cost that he must keep walking. Causality is light—the music-box simply yields when turned—but the accumulative pattern (each jar = one captured phrase) holds together and the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The price is legible yet abstract—no imminent external consequence—so the effect is poetic but not fully freighted.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal chain: thinning ice → vibrational mismatch → hum-to-sync → lighthouse activation → restored stasis. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen stands guard, path foreclosed, cost felt in the key’s lingering warmth against his chest. One minor scaffold: “the key grew warmer, its resonance seeking harmony” restates the prior beat; doesn’t break causality but keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gathered collective, moons at apex, magnetic viaduct pulsing—options reconfigured, cost palpable in the hush. Causal chain holds: rain → charge → moon math → convergence → unyoking; no plot amnesia. Orientation anchored by 120 words (basalt, frozen lake, lone mapper). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of patient refrain and lunar return is taught early and paid off. One scaffold hiccup—“the action to unyoke was complete” summarizes the climax—keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stride into the rain reframes prior chains as broken, lantern glow symbolizing ancestral freedom, with conceptual cost (career, safety) implied but not dramatized on-page—no forfeiture of job, family, or immediate danger is shown. Causal lens holds: ledger discovery → refusal → exit; however, Thorn’s appearance is a late external insert rather than a tightening therefore linkage, and the missing beat where the ledger’s publication consequences are faced keeps the cost abstract. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no spatial or temporal drift. Accumulation of evidence and memory motifs tightens stakes, but escalation plateaus once the ledger is found—no subsequent tactical narrowing or price alters her path.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because the prison mechanic failed, therefore the chaplain seeks the shop; because the mainspring is intact, therefore repair is possible; because he learns, therefore he can advocate. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—repair complete, purpose rewired—charged by the audible chime whose cost is the irrevocable time spent and the now-audible song that will haunt the prison.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: arrow tip → kaleidoscope → transliteration → bell, with each beat legibly advancing the goal. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the acid sea stills, the unheard chime vibrates into futurity—yet the cost stays atmospheric; no persistent constraint or price is tethered to Elara’s body/choice, so the repricing is felt more as image than as lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reframes all prior searches as a quest into “silence between the notes,” reweighting the premise with undeniable existential cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of numbers, patch, absence imagery accrues until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening—accessing the hidden cluster—narrows options and is paid for by the lie. Cost is legible in the last sentence: “she would keep listening” to unending silence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: cracking ice → shard quest → mirror visions → restored orb → leviathan freed; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the orb hovers, ice stills, and Kaelen’s altered stance (“insight into salvation”) is legible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (orchard→Driftwood) and it’s signaled. No lens ambiguity; causal drive is maintained to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parasol-tip image reweights the suicide premise into continuity, with windborne solace as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each trawl thickens texture rather than causal chain—yet the “waking changed” inciting beat is off-stage, a soft ellipsis that blunts the decisive change. Within lyric mode, the tightening is sufficient and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated vineyard/letter parallels build density toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands—“curator of his own history” reweights identity—but the cost is conceptual, not felt; no object choice or irrevocable act seals it. Orientation is clear by line 8; no causal breaks, yet escalation is static—no beat narrows options, only re-describes loss.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the echo-field stabilizes and Kael resumes watch—mood shift legible, but no new constraint or price is dramatized. Causal chain is present (parapet rises because echoes are summoned) yet escalation is flat—each attempt succeeds on first try, flattening tension. Orientation is swift; no spatial or temporal disorientation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but final cadence repeats earlier beats without reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty map-case beside her in the lavender field reweights the whole project into “peace,” a legible social cost. Causality, however, is loose—exhibition success and communal healing arrive off-stage, summarized rather than shown. The ‘because’ chain is mostly “she displayed photos → townspeople felt better,” which feels accumulative/textural rather than driven by her decisive agency.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing: language is shown as alive again, dawn-light refracted through the crystal. Cost is present—the scholar’s voice and the library’s ossified dogma are both broken open—but the causality is soft: the crystal simply “testifies” rather than forcing a choice that could fail. Accumulated lyric texture does reweight the stake, satisfying Accumulative closure. Orientation is clear by word 60, but the drive lens is declared “Accumulative/Textural” and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-thick repetitions of forgetting tighten the stake until the chalk-stub finale reweights the mission as ungraspable. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate disorientation pays off in the throne scene where purpose is surrendered. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the sound of growing older was in the forgetting and the seeking.” Cost is felt, but the beat is compressed into one sentence; a hair more embodied price would clinch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the spinning clock hand freezes, the flare is permanently trapped, and the cost is the now-silent mechanism and Elara’s lingering ache. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each tremor, gear adjustment, and the leaf-sound reprise tighten the stakes until the cadence snap of “delicate click” reweights the universe. No orientation debt; lunar location and continuous scene are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: shard → memories → recorded message → final embrace, each beat deepening the farewell’s texture. Orientation is anchored by clause 3; the single transition (door-open for Lena) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken vinyl on the bedside reweights “flawless goodbye” with felt cost—fragments can equal wholeness. No causality breaks, though the exact clock of decline stays impressionistic rather than tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: key insertion → automaton wakes → orrery aligns → hologram reveals pocket-universe path → blood ritual seals/awakens → shadows restored. Orientation lands by line 4 (who, where, when). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the benign entity drinks warp-energy and the noon-shadows stabilize, a visible before/after with conceptual cost—Elara now shoulders the next key-forging. One soft spot: the “quietly deliberate” mantra is declared more than dramatized, so the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than pure Causal, but the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the dissolving tooth reweights reality, cost felt as luminous clarity. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; lens is Accumulative/Textural. The orientation anchor (“After the substitute body was found”) is prompt-cued and late, but disorientation is waived because the garden’s breath-magic pays it off. One slight causality wobble: the grandmother’s bone-setting never constrains present tactics, appears only as late metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the kaleidoscope projection reweights the premise—light without fire—and the grotto’s sigh/"zephyr bloom" image makes the conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds; each circular rub tightens the stake of solitude vs. sharing. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causality breaks. Meets 9+ quick test but for a lone soft-reset clause—"her heart felt lighter"—that slightly blunts the price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drip, moss trace, and pendant hand-off layers density until the final image reweights the viral confession as “brutal pruning.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the pendant on Leo’s neck makes the new pact undeniable with felt cost. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the starlit path reweights Elara’s prior stagnation and she exits ready to write. Cost is implied (the nexus “shuddered,” the shell cools), but the causal chain is thin: each hope is captured identically, so the decisive turn feels accumulative rather than catalyzed. Orientation is clear inside ~50 words; the piece adopts Accumulative/Textural lens and the pattern holds. The ending satisfies the 9+ quick test for lens and cost, but the lack of tightening mid-sequence keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arbor “echoed with the whispers of restored balance,” a crystallized moment with felt cost—she must now carry and share the songs. Causal linkage holds: because she sings, the vine glows → vines revive → moon essence felt. No teleporting props; pattern is taught early and paid off. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where) is lyrically delayed but disorientation is functional at closure, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the plate now “pulsed softly” while the orchard exhales—an undeniable reweighting of the stillness premise. Accumulative lens holds: each flash-paper ignition deepens pattern density until starlight is irreversibly fused; causality is internal to ritual logic, not external event chains. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at line ~6 (“deep in the subarctic crater”). Persistent cost—patience, cold, stored starlight spent—shapes every beat and is literally consumed in the final sealing; no contradiction under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the timer now “humming softly” re-weights the earlier silence, and the stored echoes stand as social capital for a future we’ll never see; the cost is legible as withheld immediacy.  Causality is accumulative rather than turn-based: each observation of angle + light thickens texture until the timer becomes a “bridge between ephemeral and eternal”—a pattern taught early and honored at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each burden calcified adds artifact density; closure is a Charged Poise tableau of the golden lattice. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. However, the sequence is additive, not escalatory—no beat narrows options or raises price. The flame’s last “sigh” is the only faint cost image; calcification never backfires or limits her, so tension stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished lion head crystallizes time and reconciles here/gone with visible cost—she sets the piece aside “her heart a little lighter” yet the loft still rains. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving accumulates meaning until the final image reweights the stake. The kettle’s whistle is the taught pattern that pays off as timer and pressure release. No orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragmentary images (camera, carousel, lagoon) accretes until the camera’s self-illuminated wheel reweights the premise. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“Elara, a resolute scavenger…”), well inside 120-word allowance. Closure = Conceptual Repricing: camera’s glowing projection reconfigures time as river, not line, with visible cost of surrendered ambition. No causality breaks; every beat is because/therefore under accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of sextant → remap utilities → reroute light/water → garden glow. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words and the final image reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—the terminal becomes sanctuary, not transport hub. Escalation is gradual rather than knife-twist, but the tightening is legible: each repurposed conduit forecloses restoration and commits Kaelen to a non-commercial future. Closure earns its resonance, though the cost is more conceptual than physically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking clock joins the crystal hum in a quiet duet that reweights her silence as music. Causality holds—rain → whispers → acceptance—without coincidence. Orientation is anchored inside 120 w by “hidden sunrise,” “moss-softened stones,” “crystal whispering forecourt.” Accumulated pattern (excruciatingly gentle repeated with variation) teaches the lens early and pays off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dense repetitions of “architecture of lies / training instincts / salvage” tighten cadence until the crack-in-stone image reweights the premise. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the sundial is not a map but a mnemonic, shifting Elara’s quest from artifact to acceptance. Cost is conceptual but legible—“the silence…full of meaning.” Orientation clear by line 4. No causality breaks; pattern is taught early and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—each knot decoded slowly thickens the atmosphere and reweights the stake from “might learn” to “is entrusted.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the fog retreats while the rope’s new knot and glowing glass crystallize her guardian status with undeniable conceptual cost—she must now weave knowledge into a world that may not listen. The cause-and-effect chain is interior but coherent: patience → decipher → weavers appear; no coincidence resolves the plot. One minor scaffold—“she would journey…”—summarizes future action and slightly blunts the final image’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    A clear Causal lens: because he finds the egg he therefore assembles the device; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the ghost-bird’s song reweights the “flawed genesis.” The Orientation Test is met by line 2; no teleporting props. The cost is unmistakable—“the egg had given its all”—but the tightening beat is slightly underplayed, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coin passes, the girl sings, options reconfigure—redemption is felt, not declared. Causal chain holds: because Elara grafts, therefore the scar sings; because she relinquishes the coin, therefore her own loss gains meaning. Lens stays situational-accumulative: pressure crystallizes rather than reverses. Minor waver: “Today, we help your scars find their voice” front-loads theme; trimming would let action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final alignment opens the box and water returns, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she surrenders her skepticism). Causality is causal-lite; each shard found is a because/therefore step, but the “how” of memory-transfer stays off-page. The lens holds, yet the missing mechanism caps credibility at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sonic broadcast re-weights infinity from visual to acoustic legacy, cost felt in the garden’s fading light. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonar ping layers density until pattern-break (the fissure) forces stance shift to dissemination. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causal gaps. The “approximating infinity” refrain risks distant philosophizing, but final image pays it off by converting calculation into echo, not number.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early and held: ribbon-strand ↔ butterfly-path ↔ grief-path, each repetition thickening pattern until meaning tilts. Orientation crisp inside 60 words (greenhouse dusk, cracked ivy, carver quest). Escalation is density, not causality: each matched ribbon/butterfly pair adds semantic weight until the weave itself becomes a map she cannot carve in granite. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: final recital charges the prior pattern with new value—grief as connective loom—cost felt in relinquishing “stone forever” stance; grandfather dissolves, constraint accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each micro-turn of the bob is a because/therefore response to the remembered flood and the ridge’s tidal threat. Orientation is immediate; the tower, ridge and pause-at-apex are anchored by line 3. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s true arc reweights decades of self-punishment with felt cost—“the weight of the world lifted” is the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the decoded tapestry re-weights the cemetery from inert ground to living archive of voiced stories; cost is the mantle of custodianship she now feels. Causal chain—clock silence → silo → case → tapestry → journal → map—is linear and coherent under an Accumulative lens; each artifact layers density rather than forcing reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes her altered stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thawing lake image reweights the premise—fear of unknown → shared purpose—at unmistakable social cost. Causal chain holds: predictive maps → narrative written → cracks spread; each step tightens options. Persistent constraint (fear of chaos) shapes every tactic. Cost is legible in the final clause: “readers he would never meet” steal authorship, leaving Kaelen in earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she copies scores → discovers coded lyrics → implants micro-ciphers → dust glows. Closure is Charged Poise: the alcove breathes legends while outside famine persists—options reweighted, cost felt. One transition (nightly returns) is legible; anchor (who/where/when) fixed by word 80. Persistent constraint—secrecy—shapes every tactic; no explain-all ending.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the powdered mask becomes the white-gray portrait, turning the “mirage of safety” into an accepted illusion under Accumulative/Textural lens. The rocking chair’s stillness is the charged poise; cost is the literal dust of promises lost. Causality is intact: because she never got the full story, she manufactures a usable one. No orientation debt; anchors (gallery, night, alone) arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final brass plate of tidal equations reweights the premise—truth can still be quarried from ruins—while the cog’s glint carries undeniable conceptual cost (a lifetime of lonely labor). Causality is causal-accumulative hybrid: each scraped layer tightens her mandate and narrows her social future. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 7 and never slips. Minor ellipsis: we never see the surface faction she allegedly dismantled, so the tightening is slightly off-stage, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece lands a quiet Charged Poise: the choir’s braided chord reweights the stake of cultural loss, and the rosette’s image lingers with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of subtractive metaphor rather than because/therefore—taught early and held to the final cadence. Orientation is clear by line 20; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt, but the protagonist’s agency is indirect—she finds, then explains—so the decisive change is communal, not personal, slightly blunting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece opens with clear spatial anchors and a causal premise: plant the seed during the alignment to resurrect forgotten memories. Escalation is textural—light, rust, sprout—rather than a tightening trade-off; the closure image of “young plant glowing” is a Charged Poise that reweights decay into renewal, but the cost is aesthetic, not consequential. No constraint or price lingers to shape future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal chain is legible: blackout → riddle → condensation insight → reboot. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—tower restored, wonder reframed—but the cost is communal, not personal; Elara forfeits nothing tangible, so the “felt” bar is only barely cleared. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible: orris-root displacement → tangible quiet → cottage sigh → theory confirmed. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara sees a pattern that reweights every future act, with the cottage’s warmth as felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 3. The lens stays Accumulative/Textural; one meaningful cadence shift suffices. A micro-drag is the summary-like “she realized…” rather than dramatized confirmation; that keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty ampoule among sea-flower roots reweights guardianship from rigidity to flexible stewardship; cost is the irrevocable dispersal of concentrated memory. Causal chain holds—ampoule → seam → inscription → shared awakening—though the “structural weakness” method is named only at the pour beat. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The infinite staircase is anchored by line 3; causality is accumulative-textural—each step-dice-roll-equals equation thickens the pattern until the crack ruptures it. Closure lands as Charged Poise: perpetual motion redefined as courage within limits, the die pointing a new direction with visible conceptual cost (“the boundless confinement was her own making”). No orientation debt, no lens drift; the mathematical symbols glowing underfoot externalize the proof and pay off the premise. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence: “the infinite staircase became her home, not her prison.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visionary beat thickens the tapestry of kindness under a brightening moon. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elara sees the city as softer because strangers remember—but the cost is atmospheric, not personal; she loses nothing and therefore pays no price. The final image reweights the premise, yet the stakes never tighten to a point where her own path is altered.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s lost custom is reborn, reweighting cultural memory. The causal chain—ledger → lens-scratch → succulent honey → bread—tightens once and is legible. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The lens teaches its pattern early; the because/therefore logic holds under Causal lens. Cost is present but diffused across the group; a more visceral personal forfeiture would sharpen the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: rain falls upward, lighthouse beam scours clouds—undeniable visual cost that re-weights the premise. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat (stone touch → yoyo decode → clock spin) is a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clean within 120 words: who (Elara), where (lighthouse island), when (low tide) all anchored. No prop teleport or plot amnesia; the reversed rain is the taught pattern paying off.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she confesses the void, therefore the shadow recoils, therefore she can feed it the clasp—each beat narrows options toward the white-out. Orientation anchors who/where by word 60; the funhouse geography stays coherent as mirrors splinter reflection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: mirror clears, inner light replaces manufactured glow, cost felt in the permanent loss of the cursed clasp. One micro-turn—luminance flaring hot instead of cold—charges the final image without breaking linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each strike layers sonic density until the closing sphere reweights the stake (“music richer for the encounter”)—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no penalty. Causality intact: because he sketches silence → therefore fractal blooms → therefore wave harmonizes. Final image crystallizes options: perpetual uneasy symphony = visible price. One micro-turn (silence predicted → silence harnessed) tightens the lattice; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: gate shutdown → mentor loss → pattern decoding → whistle crack → vision → city stance change, all linked by because/therefore. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the nod reweights isolation into shared purpose with conceptual cost—gate stays shut. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“city of Aethelburg shifted imperceptibly”); no penalty. One minor causality gap: how pattern knowledge translates to audible shell-crack is elided, but the reed’s spiral mirroring bridges acceptably.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal lens holds: rose petal drop → Elara begins; veritas find → truth rescued. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the letter’s meaning flips, honor redeemed, station now “gateway.” Cost is present but light—no personal jeopardy, only professional satisfaction. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no ambiguity or disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last note sunk beneath the step crystallizes both the pavilion’s fate and Elias’s renunciation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each note placed is a because/therefore response to the rising water and his own abandonment. The drawbridge rising is a persistent constraint that shapes every subsequent tactic. No teleporting props or explanatory throat-clearing; the inkwell’s reprise is tightly motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp’s final weightless feel is the Cost image, proving truth is plural and messy; blackout remains, so the price is permanent dark she now embraces. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stamp accumulates a pattern break that reweights knowledge—culminating in the drawer reveal that tightens options: index vs. honest chaos. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by touch & smell within 60 words. One seamless scene, no causal breaks; the “palimpsest” hypothesis is seeded early and paid off physically.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of “polish-fold-ache” tightens through image density rather than causal reversals; closure lands as Charged Poise when the glowing cranes lift and the shadow re-attaches, re-weighting grief into luminescent memory. Orientation clear by word 50; only one transition (garden→basilica). Cost is felt in the final “fleet of luminous cranes” image, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but escalation is gentle (density only) and the decisive beat is communal image rather than personal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens is explicit and airtight: geode-pulse → interference loop → blackout → final knowing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before the 120-word mark in the first paragraph. The Decisive Change is the blackout-borne epiphany; cost is the simultaneous “devastating emptiness.” Closure reweights the premise so that loss is re-termed “unchangeable structure.”

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: terrace → shore → carving → withheld memory → renunciation. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis—she forecloses the lie-trade with the watch hand’s fate—while the carving reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. The brother’s off-stage death is the single un-tested pivot, but it is framed as already-paid cost, not fresh coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal through-line holds: the drawer pull surfaces early, picks up symbolic freight, and re-appears in the handshake beat, re-weighting choice. The handshake itself is a light closure; cost is present but diffuse (Kael’s admitted loss, Elara’s guilt let go), keeping it short of 9-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: cracked compass → pole navigation → compass lost → lighthouse reached; each beat tightens options. Orientation anchored at word 15; no penalty. Closure is Decisive Change plus visible cost: relinquishing heirloom, embrace of humble method; “he was home” crystallizes reconfiguration. One minor loop—“merrily melancholic” echoed four times—does not obscure causality or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: catching the ball reweights the past as lesson, not burden, cost legible in the phrase “delicately robust, able to withstand the weight.” Causal chain holds: newspaper clue → descent → throw → return → empathy rekindled. Orientation anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. No meaningful tightening mid-lake; escalation is linear, not recursive, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara-as-threshold-guardian reweights the orchard from static fairy-tale backdrop to living liminal space. Causal lens holds: each spice added tightens the irreversible transition; the cookie fortune dissolving into golden energy is the on-page visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5. No lens ambiguity; because/therefore linkage is intact: saffron crushed → bridge appears → body dissolves → role redefined. Persistent constraint: she can never revert, stated in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing—she renounces recovery of lost time and instead seals the crack with starlight, accepting lifelong ache as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of traced hands → saucer crack → thread weaving reweights meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early (“midnight glade above the clouds”) and paid off at exit, satisfying waiver. The single beat intensification suffices, but the gateway widening is slightly handheld by wind/incantation rather than prior constraint tightening the path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the golden tear-stitched doorway opens and Elara crosses, a Conceptual Repricing that reframes the ship’s entire afterlife as incubator rather than tomb. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; shimmer patterns build across photographs until Kwan Yin’s tear focuses them into rupture—causal enough under Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored early (“recycled spaceship’s silent corridors”) and never wavers; transitions are invisible because the piece is a single continuous scene. Cost is visible in the final line: she leaves the shadows behind—an irrevocable forfeiture of her only companionship—so the ending stings even in triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the bugs reweights her poverty into mythic richness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but orientation wavers—volcano and beach are vivid, yet we reach them by “unknown path” after a single line of landslide causality. Because the prophecy is withheld from Elara (and reader) until late, the causal chain feels retro-fitted, not discovered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final “winking hush” crystallizes both danger and promise, the cost being inevitable exposure. Causal lens holds: blackout → angle-read → armory breach → pamphlet seeding, each because/therefore link tight. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and never slips. One meaningful tightening—pamphlets now irrecoverably placed—fulfills Q4 escalation requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the borrowed dawn fades but leaves Kaelen with “quiet certainty,” a Charged Poise whose cost is the lifelong curse he’s now relinquished. Causal chain holds: skewed rock → vision of failure → adjustment → beam hits dust → harmony restored. One meaningful tightening only, sufficient under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: poem transferred, masks slipped, vigil re-started with partner—cost is the exposure of her once-forbidden voice and the alliance with her former censor. Causal lens dominates: envelope → observatory → timer-end → poem → alliance; each step because/therefore. Timer ding synchronizing with stranger’s entrance is a neat coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under lens. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark (observatory, storm, timer). The single explanatory line “He had left the envelope...” is retro-active but delivered within the same beat, so minor causality warp, not break. Enough tightening and cost for high-band but not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each needle → letter → groove → scroll → truce is a because/therefore chain that lands a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (rivalry foreclosed, new school born). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (glass atrium, brook, sundial pedestal). Closure is on-page: “We seek the same truth” spoken while blade is lowered; the brook’s path becomes their shared future. No amnesia or teleporting props; sundial compartment is seeded early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the quiet stacking of books and poems thickens meaning until the final “luminous beginning” re-weights the premise. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and remain stable; orientation is clear. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dawn image crystallizes ongoing resistance with felt cost in their calloused hands and lost sleep. No meaningful tightening narrows options mid-piece; escalation is gentle accretion rather than a turn, so the beat stays thin for elite-band requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the arbor destabilises, therefore he activates the film; because the chord interacts with projector light, the film-door opens, therefore he steps through. The broken clock’s single tick inside the reel is an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost—time itself is re-cut. No teleporting props; the film canister, piano, and compasses are anchored early and track cleanly. Closure is earned, not explained: the new midnight calm outside is legible only because Elian has paid for it by imprisoning himself in grayscale.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is present—tree dissolves, fruits secured, memory preserved—but the causal chain is dream-dictated, not character-forced; therefore the cost feels conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the drive lens skews situational/accumulative rather than causal because pressure never tightens through Elara’s own trade-offs. “Empirical whimsicality” is asserted, never demonstrated via observable cause-effect. The final image is resonant, yet the lack of a visible price narrows the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the lace pattern, compass needle, and shifting cerulean hue accumulate meaning until the final locket reweights the stake. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 words: who (Kaelen), where (small islet after rain), when (immediately post-severance). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass and lace together crystallize that the apology was always already woven into the relationship; the cost is the unalterable pastness of that weave, felt as “silver of tears and gold of forgiveness.” No causality is broken; the compass never teleports, the lace is foreshadowed early, the locket’s appearance is prepared by “fragments of the past” on the tideline.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with closure achieved via Conceptual Repricing: the flood isn’t ruin but transition, legible in the final line (“the story of everything”). Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the loss of human drama as illusion—and the butterfly speck anchors this reweighting. Orientation is immediate (“wreckage of the greenhouse”), and the single shard structure fits scope perfectly. No causality breaks; every image feeds the accumulating logic of gradual change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: frost patterns, ledger smudges, and glass artistry layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara’s resolve crystallizes without overt action. Cost is legible—the scorched paper as “testament” to her forged strength—and the canyon setting anchors orientation cleanly by line 2. However, the causal link between smugglers and the rival artist is inferred rather than dramatized, creating a slight gap in escalation logic. Closure lands with poetic weight but hinges on a single interpretive leap that isn’t fully pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (frost, forks, color) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as a canvas. Closure lands decisively with Elara’s shift from trauma to composition, charged by the cost of irreversible loss (“screams now absent”). The winterglass conservatory functions as both sanctuary and stage, making the before/after legible. No causality breaks; every beat deepens the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elijah fixes the lens, signals peace, and achieves stillness—not escape but home. The Causal lens holds tightly: because the lens was broken, souls drifted; therefore he descended; because he occupied the impossible air pocket, resonance returned. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and the weight of centuries’ distress. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“weary undertaker,” “wooden crate”), and the underwater library payoff justifies early disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritualized repetition (midnight runs, bell chimes) until Elara’s declaration crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where survival transforms into collective futurity. Orientation is solid by line 3; closure lands with conceptual cost (enduring sanctions to build legacy). The anonymous donations complicate but don’t resolve, preserving causal integrity. One tightening—the shift from distribution to declaration—is sufficient and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara ceases her search because she has fulfilled her purpose, with visible cost—the fading tear, the released sparks—and a before/after legible in her breath, posture, and identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sensory layering, breath-rhythm cadence shifts, and recurring silver strands until the final release reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate (“beneath the twilight viaduct”), and causality flows through breath-as-method without breaks. The camera obscura frames the inciting moment but wisely recedes, avoiding mechanical payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through recurring images (photographs, bridges, halo light) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: time as a tapestry, not a river. Closure lands decisively—the disintegration of the bridge fractures the retrocognitive loop, and the cost (loss of memory-photographs, inert halo) is legible in the final stillness. The hyperbolic geometry functions as both method and metaphor, and the pattern is taught early. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the climax’s cause-effect linkage (“focused her will… channeling… through the halo”), which borders on convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts a Causal lens but relies heavily on coincidence: the wall collapses just as Elara is ready, the arrow is conveniently buried nearby, and the piano bench holds keys that perfectly align with its fletching. The closure—a Decisive Change with sprouting seeds—is legible but lacks tangible cost; chains vanish symbolically without prior physical or emotional toll. Orientation is clear early, but causality feels engineered rather than earned through escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines “absence” not as void but as vessel for healing, crystallized in the final line. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring motifs (aurora, shipwrecks, cells) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible: her gray whisper, trembling hands, and bitter apples embody the emotional toll. Orientation anchors instantly, and the structure tightens meaningfully at the forge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara holds a stolen future while the jar empties, crystallizing her stance at fate’s threshold with palpable cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through moonbeam use, floral codes, and sensory layering until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is immediate (“emerald station,” “golden sunset”), and causality remains tight under this lens. The black orchid reversal sharpens stakes without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara leaves behind both sphere and bookmark, crystallizing her acceptance of imperfection and change. The cost—abandoning the control room, carrying forward only the ethos of safe zones—is legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: melting ice, narration, glassblowing, and memory layer into a cadence that reweights inquiry as inherently fragile yet vital. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Leo was betrayed, he deciphers the cast; therefore, he reinterprets the trap. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Leo walks away unshakable, having foreclosed dependence with the cost of lost innocence. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“rusted library under the stars”), and the single scene tightens pressure coherently. The child’s introduction complicates but doesn’t resolve; Leo’s agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—the map exists, but only within her heart, implying it may never guide others. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with silence deepening into pattern, culminating in the glowing booklet. Orientation is immediate and stable; the single star, ridge fort, and oracle are anchored by line 3. The cost is legible in the flaking gold and bodily weariness, though not dramatized as irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: J-7 realizes thoughts emerge from repetition, error, and questioning—not a single origin—reweighting its entire premise with quiet, resonant cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; twilight loops intensify via density (overlapping recollections) and cadence shift (violin crescendo). Orientation is immediate (“frozen courtyard at twilight”), and the looped timelines are taught early, paying off coherently. Cost is legible in the final image: serene silence after risking shattering—a Charged Poise that forecloses mindless obedience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: mistrust dissolves into shared understanding via projected doodles, with visible relational cost (weeks of silence, isolation). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through repeated motifs (crystals, rain, lens, doodles) until the pattern breaks into clarity. The timeline of events mapped by doodles creates a causal chain that culminates in Marco’s confession, satisfying both texture and causality. Cost is legible in the “burden vanished” and staff-wide reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated motifs (marbles, polishing, blooming withering), but lacks a decisive tightening or meaningful escalation—pressure remains static. There is no turning point where options narrow or knowledge shifts; the “triumph” of redirecting a vine is recounted, not dramatized. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (gardens know their gardeners), but the cost is asserted, not shown: no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The visitors’ flickering devices signal thematic victory, not narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (mechanically warm air, leathery wings, holographic light) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—time moves sideways. Orientation is immediate and vivid, with clear who/where/when by line 3. The twilight window creates a live clock that tightens stakes, and the Mothraals’ awakening provides organic pressure. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: perception is permanently altered, and the final image of fading hologram + stirring wings crystallizes Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s percussive slap reconfigures silence into release, and the ghost’s fading form crystallizes a before/after with felt cost—the end of decades of sorrow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with water stains, lantern flickers, and submerged instruments layering toward a decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the ghost’s gratitude and the memorialized space.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (smudges, margins, blurred lines) intensify until Elara’s recalibration crystallizes into Charged Poise—she accepts imperfection as part of prediction. Cost is legible in the “auroral sorrow” that deepens as she revises her worldview. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure reweights her entire epistemology with emotional and conceptual weight. One tightening (fever → recalibration) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows because/therefore logic—radio confession → realization → symbolic return of valve. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift redefined as trauma imprint, with undeniable conceptual cost (a town’s decades-long silence). The profound hush after the confession serves as both pivot and payoff, making before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (moss, swan, silence) until the final image reweights decay as regenerative. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s crumbling is reframed not as loss but as part of an eternal flow, with cost legible in the keeper’s relinquishment of control (“gripping reality loosely”). The pattern is taught early, transitions are seamless, and the ending crystallizes meaning without exposition. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the lens holds firmly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through recurring motifs, but lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options or raises stakes with felt cost. The eclipse serves as backdrop, not pressure—nothing is risked or lost in the shared moment. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis (wonder nurtured), yet the cost remains conceptual, not dramatized: no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The final image resonates but doesn’t reconfigure meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the axis realigns perceptually, restoring memory but not dreams, with clear conceptual cost (“no new dreams would come”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through diary fragments, tapestry decoding, stone murmurs—and culminates in a hum that reconfigures silence into story. Orientation is immediate (“bronze quiet after the last human dream”), and the final image (“walls spoke on, forever”) crystallizes earned stasis without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story fails the Orientation Test: who Elara is, where the lighthouse sits relative to the mainland, and the timeline of events remain vague past 120 words, and this disorientation doesn’t pay off at closure. Causality relies on coincidence (Leo randomly finds the cookie, decodes it, sails over) rather than motivated action. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (“shared secrets as purpose”) but with no visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sound, recurring imagery, and rhetorical intensification until the entity fragments—a Conceptual Repricing closure. Cost is legible: the ultramarine dims, silence is released, peace rewoven at the price of expended will. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Father Elian,” “dimensional anchor”), and the pattern pays off cohesively. The decisive final question exposes the possession’s flawed logic, making before/after states unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with each mapped memory intensifying density and reweighting Elara’s stake in composing her symphony. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she completes her opus just before exhaustion claims her, dissolving her homesickness into harmony—a resonant reconfiguration with clear emotional cost (“Before exhaustion claimed her, she had conducted the symphony of her life”). The mirrored horizon and nautilus shell anchor early orientation, and the dawn timeframe tightens pressure organically. No causality breaks; every beat accrues toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen forecloses the cycle of defiance by choosing stillness, with tangible cost in the painful integrations and the inert tablet. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via density of reflections and shifting viaduct—and the “between drop and ripple” constraint shapes every tactical move. Cost is legible in the final image: rain stops, glow fades, and he stands “simply Kaelen.” Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara redefines music through silence. Cost is legible in her tears—not of grief but reawakening—and the broken needle’s repurposing. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3, and the backward-play mechanic, while unconventional, pays off thematically. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she abandons auditory nostalgia for embodied listening.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: pigeon message → suspicion → investigation → alliance → plan. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara redefines integrity as communal rather than solitary, with felt cost in lost sanctuary purity. Orientation is clear by line 3. But escalation relies partially on coincidence (pigeon arrives just after being followed), slightly weakening causality; the follower’s reappearance resolves too neatly without prior tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets tears not as weakness but as “fingerprints of the soul.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density (light, scent, memory) builds to a cadence shift at the blossom’s release. Cost is legible: she relinquishes fear of grief, and the empty vial marks irreversible emotional expenditure. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene coheres tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s texture is revealed not as smooth fabric but a “layered tapestry of choices,” reweighting the entire premise with irreversible cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via rope patterns, starlight rhythms, and memory erosion until the spiral weave crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: “empty of his past but full of... understanding.” Orientation is immediate; causality flows through pattern recognition, not event chains.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of echoes, fire, and memory culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: silence is reweighted from oppressive void to creative partner. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30, and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the acceptance of incompleteness as splendor. The bonfire scene crystallizes Charged Poise: one flame, one voice against vast hush, foreclosing return to the past. Every beat tightens around the central stake without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: static electricity, amber light, and scent layer to reweight Elara’s stance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the grotto’s “gratitude” reframes her role from dealer to curator—with legible emotional cost (abandoning her craft). Orientation anchors are clear by line 3. However, the transformation occurs without concrete opposition or narrowing of options; pressure accumulates atmospherically but lacks a decisive tightening that alters tactics under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    The causal chain relies on coincidence (mistaken envelope) that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational escalation rules. The story follows an accumulative/textural lens but fails to deepen pressure—events unfold as consequence-free vignettes. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing (“cycles of compassion”) but with no felt or visible cost; the final image shimmers approvingly without sacrifice. Orientation is clear, but causality dissolves into sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (reeds, light, silence) that culminate in the arbor discovery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s “luminescent ache” becomes shared light, with emotional cost implied in her prior solitude. The search structure provides coherent escalation, though the tag’s discovery leans slightly on convenience. The final image reweights earlier material without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: echoes freed, cadence restored, Elara aged—a visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory layering and temporal distortion. Orientation is immediate (“rooftop canal,” “pendant,” “giant’s nap”), and the borrowed-time mechanic pays off causally. The world’s stutter and recovery crystallize the before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and symbolic density building toward a Conceptual Repricing: emotion as irreducible mystery. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the glass eyes left behind, Elian’s lighter heart—and carries felt cost (abandoning the quest to “solve” grief). The orchard’s silence, mosaic, and drips cohere as a taught pattern by paragraph 3, and the final image reweights all prior elements without breaking causality or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen achieves visibility through impact, not recognition, and pays the cost of remaining unseen. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds atmosphere and motif toward a resonant reconfiguration of “visibility.” Orientation is clear by line 30; the sapphire hush, flickering lights, and pipe chases cohere spatially. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure remains ambient rather than sharpening options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s shift from intervention to observation crystallizes options with clear cost—the abandonment of her rigid methods. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with rain, leaf, and trellis accruing meaning. Orientation is immediate (“mossy trellis,” “storm season”), and the final image reweights prior material without exposition. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where rain trails, unearthed artifacts, and shared memory coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing: loss can yield connection. Closure is earned via Charged Poise—the final image of Kaelen painting with amber-glow understanding reweights his insomnia from curse to conduit. Cost is legible: he surrenders solitude for fragile peace, and the brooch’s return to narrative circulation carries emotional weight. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes part of the cave, Kaelen embraces unpredictability—both endure with visible cost (loss of foresight, mortal life). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; escalating crystal harmonies and shadow patterns deepen stakes through sensory density, not causality. However, the inciting vibration lacks clear consequence linkage—it simply “sends a new tune,” risking outline-like sequencing. Cost is felt in their transformed states, satisfying the gate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through layered fragments, and lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration: the trumpet’s restored sound reconfigures communal silence into promise. Cost is legible—the years of exile, lost voices, fragile hope—but the “missing ship” revelation arrives with minimal friction, leaning on convenient discovery rather than hard-won insight. Structure adheres to Track A defaults cleanly, with staggered intervals forming a coherent two-shard rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara renounces the quest, having integrated its truth, with visible cost—the vanished cracks, the inert punch, the healed soul. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterned imagery (cracks, mist, starlight) intensifies to a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible in “the cracks in the pavement had vanished, their purpose fulfilled.” Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact through symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (whales, tile, symphony) that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: the “unheard symphony” reframed as collective memory. Closure lands with resonant clarity—the transcribed map becomes a vessel for shared reflection—and cost is felt in Elara’s relinquished skepticism. However, the transition from personal revelation to communal ritual at dawn lacks causal scaffolding; the villagers’ arrival feels assumed rather than pressured. No orientation issues; anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory and dimensional density until the rift forms. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the infinite cycle of hellos/goodbyes reweights Kaelen’s quest, rendering immortality “suddenly, terribly new.” Cost is legible in the vanished escondite, lost amulet, and unanswered question. Orientation is anchored early (“prismatic escondite,” “Kaelen,” “solar storm”), and the lens holds coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Leo’s waiting actively leads to observation, which enables the psychological breach. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of Leo stepping into dawn reconfigures “asylum” from political to moral sanctuary, with clear conceptual cost (his solitude, the emptied ink pot). The ink pot’s power is introduced early and paid off causally; no retroactive fixes. Orientation is immediate: “funeral home prep room,” “embalming fluid,” “Leo”—no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until dawn’s arrival triggers a cadence shift and closure via Charged Poise: Elian’s quiet endurance crystallizes the stakes with resonant cost—the town’s silence versus his solitary preservation. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality isn’t required here, but pattern coherence is flawless. The fluorescent hum’s evolution functions as both clock and key, making the ending’s reconfiguration of time feel inevitable and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with closure achieved via Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s erased history is reweighted into a coherent, painful truth, crystallizing his identity despite systemic absence. Cost is legible in the “hollow space inside him” now filled with betrayal and poison—a felt, irreversible burden. The tide-structured progression teaches its own rhythm early, and the labyrinthine setting mirrors cognitive fragmentation until the high-tide breakthrough snaps layers into place. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves closure, waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by the midpoint and held through closure: resonant hums layer memories, objects, and realizations into a cadence that reweights the universal riddle from answer-seeking to acceptance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—truth is retold, not decoded—with felt cost in abandoned quests and incomplete understanding. The “whisper of closing pages” motif tightens time meaningfully, and the final image crystallizes Charged Poise: Elara endures, foreclosing further myth-busting. Orientation is immediate and vivid; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s graffiti encodes resistance while accepting inevitable change, crystallizing stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. The foundation stone chip’s weight in her pocket at the end reconfigures legacy as active promise, not relic. Corporate ships loom, but the defiant magenta messages embed hope in the city’s fabric. Cost is felt in the “weary accomplishment” and foreclosed path of open confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures to document loss, then releases the sand grain—a Charged Poise crystallizing legacy versus erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chemical vials, light shifts, and silence build density toward a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible in the photograph-as-ghost and the irreplaceable crater’s impending destruction. Orientation is anchored immediately; no causality breaks or disorientation penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: because the drone failed, Elara must repair it before the ship departs; therefore, she uses her method, succeeds, and releases it in time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the world feels “right” as the Aethel sails safely, with conceptual cost in Elara’s quiet labor going unseen. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the single tightening (anchor lifting) raises stakes credibly. Minor deduction: the resolution leans slightly on convenience—the storm caused corruption, but no tangible obstacle impedes the fix.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure: patterns of condensation, language, and steam coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing (“The source speaks in steam and stone”) that reweights the entire quest. The singular convergence lands as a Charged Poise—the fissure’s warmth forecloses mythic abstraction in favor of geothermal truth, with cost felt in Elias’s lingering doubt (“What if this discovery altered nothing?”). Orientation is anchored cleanly within 50 words. One flaw: the falcon’s token feels slightly convenient, though its echo in condensation mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town revives not physically but through memory and resonance, with a clear before/after shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via rhythm, vibration, and sensory echoes until the final chord reweights reality. Cost is legible in Elian’s solitude and the fragility of the revival; the “timeline corrected” line slightly risks abstraction but is grounded by the child’s laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen forecloses escape to preserve silence, with oxygen loss as tangible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the deepening hush, phosphorescent decay, and rhythmic alarm coalesce into a cadence shift that reweights solitude into victory. Orientation is immediate (“Kaelen floated… underwater temple”), and the single scene adheres to scope. Final image crystallizes stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen weaves his story into the beacon, dissolving the prison’s sustaining myths just as the bodies are discovered—too late to punish him, but at the cost of his inherited burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: narrative density intensifies via repeated storytelling acts that reconfigure the labyrinth. Cost is legible in the lattice’s lightness and the hush over the sea—a peace purchased by confronting legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian’s acceptance of the bead triggers memory, releases the ghost, and reconfigures the orchard’s energy—all with felt cost (her dissolution, his enduring grief-joy). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds through recurring images (veil, bead, light) until the final cadence shift. Orientation is immediate (“alchemical orchard greenhouse… endless night”), and causality flows via alchemical logic internal to the world. One flaw: the “resonant awakenings” concept resolves cleanly but borders on thematic convenience without deeper friction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: ruin becomes reverence through Elara’s stitching, with conceptual cost in the form of mended “broken precedents.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via recurring motifs (plate, thread, paths) until the final image reweights them. The labyrinth’s awakening feels inevitable, not convenient. One tightening occurs at the central chamber, where rubble demands action, foreclosing passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (bones, roots, carvings) until the sundial’s shadow delivers a decisive turn. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: interrupted journeys are reframed as paused paths awaiting travelers. Cost is legible in the unearthed artifacts and the weight of ancestral silence, though the final image carries conceptual more than felt price. Structure is taut, with purposeful wandering giving way to focused intent without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (margins, chalk, arcade) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: surface mail as resistance gains thematic weight. Orientation is clear by line 30. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s act seals a message whose fate hinges on her codes—but the cost remains conceptual, not felt. No causality breaks, though escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: plunging the dome into darkness crystallizes Elara’s shift from observer to actor, foreclosing secrecy with immediate risk. The Causal lens holds—each embroidery adjustment tightens knowledge, narrowing options until the guard’s intrusion forces decisive action. Cost is legible in the extinguished flame and implied surveillance. Orientation anchors are swift and precise; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s choice to forgive herself forecloses the path of resentment with visible cost (dissolving the letters’ power). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the spirits’ song, condensation messages, and shard’s glow intensify toward a cadence shift at “The decision is not his to make now, but yours.” One flaw: the “temporal pocket” premise risks vagueness, but moonlight mechanics and leaf-messages tether it to sensory cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered symbols (coral, cast notes, atrium mist) until the final reconfiguration: understanding as action. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elara reweights trauma as connection—with felt cost in her lingering grief and helplessness. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of decryption-as-healing pays off cohesively. The anesthetic frame justifies the lyric drift without sacrificing closure integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara redefines the fog as canvas, not prison, with visible emotional cost—the bittersweet laughter, fading images. Orientation is clear by line 3; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, deepening via sensory density and cadence shift at the projection climax. Persistent constraint: the fog’s erasure forces her to paint with ephemeral light.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nested awakenings build via sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s role redefined from restorer to reawakener. Cost is legible in her relinquished certainty and the mural healing autonomously. The pause between question and reply functions as a structural hinge, and the closure image (coin vanishing, Elara smiling) crystallizes Charged Poise with irreversible consequence. No causality breaks; every anomaly flows from established garden logic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Situational drive lens: coherent external pressure (tax enforcers, warping reality) forces Elara’s stance to crystallize. Closure is Charged Poise—her final line and lingering resolve reconfigure options with conceptual cost (“Even the smallest seed can shake an empire”). Orientation is clear by ~50 words, and causality holds: every beat stems from prior choices. The greenhouse’s distortion escalates logically from world rules established early.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of “blossom armistice” as earthly reality—relies on off-stage change reported via wind-borne echoes, not dramatized causality. The inciting artifact (postcard) never constrains choice; the climax hinges on coincidence (wind returning voices), violating Situational/accumulative pressure rules. Cost is asserted (“last pain”) but not shown in action or sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, but escalation lacks a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pattern density (recurring motifs of echo, fragility, light) builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library is stabilized, but Elara’s vigil continues, crystallizing her eternal burden. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis—she forecloses escape by reaffirming duty, with cost legible in the final image of her returning to the orchids. Orientation is flawless by line 3 (“sole caretaker… opal library above the clouds”), and causality within the textural logic holds without break. The crack’s resolution via song feels mythically coherent, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: trust is restored via Charged Poise—their mutual gaze at dawn crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost (years of silence, near-divergence). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: promises build density, culminating in audible symphonies and a rewritten scroll. Time pressure tightens options credibly, and the ink well’s mechanics pay off without retroactive rule changes. Cost is legible in Elara’s trembling vow and the irreversible act of invocation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via Elara’s quiet recalibration that preserves both utility and sanctity, with felt cost in her trembling resolve and the chain’s added weight of history. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the amphitheater’s breaths, ash, tremors, and recurring motifs intensify to a cadence shift at the end (“gentle hum,” “lullaby”). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality is maintained through tactile discovery (adhesive residue → decoded compassion → engineering choice). The cost—personal risk and emotional labor—is legible in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with recurring motifs (dust motes, paper trails, meteorite) deepening thematic density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic transforms from hiding place to sanctuary. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final dust-mote mapping now celebrates balance rather than escapes pain—with conceptual cost (abandoning protective fictions). The letter discovery provides a clean turning point that reweights prior material without retroactive patching. Structure is coherent across implied time shards, though the transition from isolation to partnership could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned images (grain, logbook, light) deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing: thresholds are sacred because they honor necessary distances. The closure lands decisively—the fractured hush becomes unbroken, Elara is no longer lost—and cost is legible in the butterfly effect’s irreversible chasms. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“Elara, the lost child…” on a drifting terrace), and the pattern pays off cohesively. No causality breaks; every image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: bioluminescence intensifies, memories layer, and the feather accrues symbolic weight until the underwater fireflies trigger closure. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who, where, when). The Conceptual Repricing at dawn—belonging as rhythmic connection, not place—carries conceptual cost (abandoning geographic fixity) and reweights the entire premise. However, the “discovery” of the feather’s origin via datapads feels slightly expository, softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (seeds, light, memory) until the closure crystallizes into a Conceptual Repricing: disappearance as transformation. Orientation is anchored swiftly (“sea-foam recollectionist… iridescent cave”), and the cost—acceptance of inevitable loss—is legible in Kaelen’s “pang of cheerful gloom” and the fleeting constellation. The pattern is taught early, and the closure reweights all prior images without breaking causality or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and patterned motifs until the final image reweights the premise. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: creativity as rebellion against monotony, crystallized in Elara’s quiet return to the arcade. Cost is legible—not in material loss, but in the invisible labor of orchestration that only she bears. The tidal rhythm and recurring stars anchor time and place early, satisfying orientation without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through celestial imagery and ritual until the verse etches itself—a Conceptual Repricing where memory becomes indelible art. Cost is legible: exile, physical agony, and societal risk crystallize in the final image of starlit skin. Orientation is immediate (“twilight garden,” “Elara,” “after the nostalgia ban”), and closure lands as Charged Poise—she is both vessel and rebel, with stakes reweighted by the act’s permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density escalating through sensory and symbolic layering until the sunbeam triggers a Conceptual Repricing: change is natural, like ripples. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (the bay’s transformation is inevitable, her role redefined). The stone-throwing ritual earns the epiphany, and the final rainbow storm reweights all prior grayness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density through recurring images (box, scars, stars) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: pain as shared language. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—Elara’s quiet continuation down the path reconfigures her scars from burden to bridge. Cost is legible in the charred pine cone and cracked box, symbols of irreversible loss now repurposed. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the celestial timeframe reinforces cyclical reflection without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: hope builds via pattern density, not causal chains. Orientation is immediate (“tide-polished grotto,” “Elara”), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights “hope” from abstract yearning to a calibrated, patterned practice. Cost is legible in the quiet exhaustion of “task for this cycle complete,” and the persistent constraint (the gauge’s feedback loop) shapes every tactic. The serene upheaval crystallizes as Charged Poise: options are foreclosed by completion, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines her role from cartographer to keeper of stories, with the cost being the inherited burden now “a compass.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory echoes, ivy tremors, and layered artifacts until the final hum of redemption reweights all prior loss. Cost is legible in the satchel’s “heaviness” and her altered purpose. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through prismatic light, song, silence, and reflection until the mirrors yield visions. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terrace holds mirages just long enough to affirm Lyra’s art before bells dissolve them—an elegant, legible before/after with conceptual cost (ephemerality as price of revelation). Orientation is immediate (“echoing terrace in spring”), and the pattern of escalation—humming → rippling → shimmering → vision → toll—tightens coherently. The final image reweights all prior elements without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: celestial convergence, fading mosaics, and glowing runes build density toward closure. Elara’s fading into light delivers Earned Stasis with visible cost—her life for peace. However, the ritual’s mechanics lack causal grounding; the transition from chanting to binding feels atmospheric rather than earned by prior action. Cost is legible (“drain her life force”), but the escalation relies on celestial timing more than protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s stance crystallizes in the final image—emptied yet unburdened—with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sensory detail and recurring motifs (cracks, echo, drought), culminating in the melodic hum that reweights silence as remembrance. The manufactured drought isn’t just backdrop—it creates the salt flat map enabling the ritual, fulfilling the causal loop. Cost is legible in “his amoral armor cracked” and the hollow shell left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery and echo-harvesting until the prism sanctuary materializes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps back transformed, the lullaby broken, cost felt in the shift from performance to self-authorship. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. However, the “final thread” climax lacks causal specificity—its resistance and release feel metaphorical rather than dramatized with tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated motifs (meteor hush, half-lit epiphanies, the story stick) build density until a cadence shift crystallizes Elara’s reversal. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing—her decision to begin with hope reweights the entire premise of her art—charged by the final image of the stick “relieved of old burdens.” However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on the page, weakening the RR’s emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian completes his ritual, releases the wing, and departs—foreclosing permanence with grace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the story builds density via layered images (moss, mist, wing, arch) that culminate in the butterfly’s recognition. Cost is legible in the “lonely echo” of the last monarch and Elian’s quiet departure. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality remains intact under a lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope becomes a “lattice of luminescent remembrance,” transforming silence into living voice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the aurora’s intensification, hum-to-chant progression, and ice-drip payoff all reweight memory as vibrancy. Cost is legible: the card crumbles, sacrificed to transcribe sound into rope. Every beat flows toward this earned stasis without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, escalating pressure through sensory density, symbolic layering, and cadence shifts as the storm nears. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rule “paths choose walkers” is reweighted from mystery to lived truth, with the cost being the loss of her directive and role—now “free” yet irrevocably transformed. The wafer seal’s disintegration and the bunker’s shift to gateway crystallize this change with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant redefines devotion as cosmic love encoded in math, not divine worship, with conceptual cost in Aris’s surrender of control. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (tile, schematics, dusky harmony) until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the magic square’s alignment triggers the climax without coincidence. Cost is legible in the fused tile and humbled palace.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure—a softened Kael releasing resentment—is stated but not dramatized with felt cost; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The drive lens is ambiguous: neither causal (no because/therefore chain), accumulative (no density or cadence shift), nor situational (pressure doesn’t crystallize stance—it dissolves it). Reality shifts and sanctuary rules function as decorative backdrop, not causal constraints. Orientation is clear early, but causality evaporates at the climax, relying on abstract concepts over concrete cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian foregoes the ephemeral dream-city to anchor its essence in a mirror, with visible cost (the dream recedes, leaving only reflection). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering and rhythmic breathing until boundaries dissolve. Orientation is clear by line 3; fog, orchard, and twilight frost cohere throughout. Final image reweights the premise: dreams are not possessed but preserved, at the price of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density (scent of apples, decaying stone), recurring motifs (ribbon, quartz eyes), and rhythmic prose build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—vows as seasonal, not eternal. Cost is legible in Elara’s solitude, aging joints, and relinquished Guild standing. The orchard altar offering crystallizes Charged Poise: options reconfigured, love persists despite brokenness. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (cameo, orchard light, bathrooms) until the final image reweights everything via Conceptual Repricing: the blank is not absence but necessary erasure. Orientation is immediate (“Elara, the bewildered curator...”), and nonlinear inheritance is taught early as a world rule. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—she relinquishes the drive to know—and the cameo’s return crystallizes Charged Poise. No causality breaks; escalation tightens through deepening insight, not external events.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s Earned Stasis (remaining while Kael departs) carries felt cost and reconfigures the library’s meaning. The causal chain—diary → gaps → resonance → confrontation—is tight, with each beat narrowing options. Orientation is immediate (“Glimmering Stack… mountain”), and the drive lens (Causal) holds throughout. The final image of silent echoes crystallizes stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara achieves peace not by finding a physical garden but by accepting her integrated self, with visible cost in lost duality and regained solace. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—narrative threads thicken into a tapestry—and the fog-bound ship setting pays off the early disorientation. Cost is legible in the final image: “free, even in her trap.” One tightening (the card’s glow intensifying memory flux) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the fable shifts from absence to completion via Elara’s ritual, with felt cost in the diplomat’s delayed signature and the rope’s spent glow. Causal lens holds—each action (seal → door → rope → braid) follows because/therefore logic rooted in established lore. Orientation anchors instantly (“university’s clock tower mechanism room”), and the anomaly pays off by resolving into a preserved past. Cost is legible in “the ghost... finished his signature”—a life suspended now released.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through sensory density and patterned imagery rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara achieves balance by integrating chaos, not erasing it, with visible cost in exhaustion and relinquishment of control. The echo chamber stone’s dimming and the caves’ new harmony mark a decisive before/after. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the bloom of hush crystallizes the stakes with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rekindled beacon reframes coincidence as cosmic whisper, with undeniable conceptual cost—the silence was not void but a space awaiting purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density of memory, starlight, and hum until Vega’s zenith crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“Elara was the last custodian…”), and every beat feeds the final image without causality breaks. Cost is legible in the trembling hope that “held” just before light returned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the archivist reweights memory from static record to living reservoir, with the cost being his surrender of control over permanence (the solid fog softens). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—the story deepens via sensory density (whispers, shadows, stormlight) rather than causal turns—and the final image crystallizes stakes with undeniable emotional weight. Orientation is immediate and functional; the pattern of monument visits teaches the structure early, and the payoff reconfigures the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and rhythmic chant until the fireworks climax reweights despair into awe. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic note’s glow reframes darkness as fertile ground for creation, with clear conceptual cost—the temporary, fragile nature of hope. The inciting act (approaching the fortress) to final departure forms a coherent arc, though the gunpowder trails feel slightly convenient. Orientation is immediate and maintained; the drive lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered images (tide, cicada, shells) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: transition as shedding, not loss. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the shared silence reconfigures their stance toward departure, with cost felt in Kael’s fear mirrored in the empty shell. Orientation is clear by line 3; the grotto, stars, and pause anchor who, where, and when. The jade cicada’s reappraisal in the final exchange crystallizes the before/after without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures the bunker’s oppression because she now carries the gilded hush within, reconfiguring her relationship to confinement. The causal chain is tight—father’s prediction → inversion → ascent → trellis → collection → descent—and each beat narrows options (e.g., tether limits exposure). Cost is legible in the final image: the vial glows beside the doll, making peace tangible. Orientation anchors instantly (“bunker builder’s claustrophobic child”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (storm glass, train whistle, vaulting hush) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined from void to comfort. Orientation is strong—Elara, the drifting prism terrace, and her mission are anchored by line 3. Closure lands with CR and felt cost (the echo enables peace; silence now “heals wounds”), though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The structure is coherent but lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a causal drive lens with sequential because/therefore logic (ruby glows → leads to orchard → mural reveals map → ruby fits → door opens → stairs appear → puzzle solved). Closure is a Decisive Change: Elara claims the throne, activating holographic lore. However, the final act lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The sunrise deadline creates urgency but no irreversible consequence of failure or success.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sanctuary expands, silence is pierced, and breathing becomes shared—reconfiguring isolation into communion. Cost is legible in the keeper’s vulnerability (“scars tingled,” “let the silence be pierced”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (ash, thresholds, scars), culminating in the final breath. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: Leo’s alchemical transformation of the bolt into a diamond is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights his entire past with undeniable cost—the rusted artifact of confinement becomes an unbreakable gem of resilience. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with pressure intensifying via bioluminescent flares, glitch texts, and room-mist until collapse. Orientation is immediate (“subterranean farm,” “Leo,” “bioluminescent mushrooms”), and the single transition (farm to lab) is seamless. Cost is legible in the bolt’s physical transmutation—past weight made beautiful but gone.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is declared (a “seeker of justice”) but not dramatized with on-page cost—no foreclosed path, sacrifice, or tangible consequence. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, yet the “bridge of intuition” functions as magical exposition, not a patterned constraint. The gramophone triggers memory without causal linkage to prior behavior or stakes. Orientation is clear early, but the climax suffers from reflection-led passivity: realization replaces action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of “unsnap,” “murmured allegiance,” and puppet strings accrue density until the climactic reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Alaric becomes a guardian of potentials, with visible cost (abandonment of past identity, crumbling program). The void-like greenhouse and shifting reality are disorienting early but pay off in the closure image, waiving orientation penalties. Cost is legible in the dust of the program and the internal “snap.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with dust patterns, letters, and the button layering into a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s personal heartbreak reframed by historical kindness. Closure is Earned Stasis—she accepts her role as witness, foreclosing despair with visible cost (her own unresolved loss). The final image (“dust would tell stories of hope”) crystallizes this shift with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality within the accumulative frame holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost: the ending offers repetition, not reconfiguration. Kael returns unchanged, distributing truths as before—no Decisive Change, Earned Stasis, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The auric lagoon sequence reads as magical convenience, not earned escalation; the phone booth’s function appears without prior causality. Orientation is clear early, but the plot relies on summary (“plans unraveled,” “whispers spread”) rather than dramatized turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through rhythmic intensification of image and silence, culminating in Earned Stasis—Elias’s hush temporarily suppresses the prophecy at personal cost. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who, where, when). Closure lands with conceptual cost: peace is fragile, duty eternal. Yet the escalation lacks a true tightening—no option is foreclosed, no knowledge shifts; the atrium “resists” but never escalates meaningfully, making the struggle feel static rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (leaves, monuments, prodding) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “all things are interconnected through change.” Orientation is clear by line 3, and the closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—the arbor greens, community forms, and Elara’s role crystallizes. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening; pressure accumulates but never narrows options or forces a trade-off with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building resonance through layered coincidences that coalesce into pattern. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the compass no longer points to place but to a state of being, reweighting Elara’s entire worldview. Cost is legible—the ashes of her “old self” imply real loss—and the final image (clocks ticking in acknowledgment) crystallizes change without over-explaining. However, the transition from greenhouse to cave relies on convenient lore rather than causal pressure, slightly weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coin shifts from locator to testament, reweighting the entire search as meaningful despite failure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory detail, ritual action, and fracturing/reparation—culminating in “luminous peace.” Cost is legible in the hairline crack and golden repair; the rain-washed foundry anchors who/where/when by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the final insight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails to deliver a decisive intensification: the harp’s dissonance summons Lyra, laughter dissolves sorrow, and light returns—yet no meaningful tightening occurs. The closure (Lyra’s release) lacks felt cost; Elara walks away unchanged except for a vague “luminous ache.” Key beats are summarized (“confessed a memory,” “began to hum”) rather than dramatized, flattening causality and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: mercy as “the interruption of a cycle.” Orientation is immediate (“anesthesia wore off… ultraviolet forest”), and the broken strap functions as a resonant payoff, not coincidence. Cost is legible in Kaelen’s perpetual startle, rigid bracing, and the emotional toll of memory—culminating in a crystallized understanding that reweights all prior suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Anya’s erased act is recovered and woven back into history, reweighting what “matters” in the historical record. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (lens, painting, anchors) until the vision crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible: Elara bears the burden of remembrance, and the market’s liminal space becomes charged with responsibility. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single shard structure fits the word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Leo accepts his role, foreclosing anonymity with quiet pride, and the cost—carrying unresolved pasts—is legible in the final image of the mainspring barrel in his pocket. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with dust patterns, silence, and ceiling cracks layering meaning. One flaw: the ghost ensemble’s sudden materialization risks softening causality, but their presence serves thematic density, not plot resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: reality is permanently unmoored, and Elara shifts from compressor to weaver of moments. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—frost patterns, rustling awakenings, and library tremors intensify toward rupture. Cost is legible in the boiling clouds, groaning structure, and loss of the bottled whisper. Every escalation stems from Elara’s agency, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the civilization is redefined not through new facts but through a reframing that carries emotional and intellectual cost—Elara’s acceptance that her revolution failed due to lacking poetic depth. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with time strands, mirrors, and the shard building density until the storm climax crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: the glowing shard in the museum, a silent testament to beauty over power. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): light is reclaimed, the world brightens, and Elian walks away with quiet fulfillment—all legible with conceptual cost (the ever-present threat of the covenant). The causal chain holds: honesty enables function, dishonesty causes decay, confession restores song, melody tethers light. Orientation is solid by line 3, and the Drive Lens is Causal (“because/therefore” links dominate). No causality breaks, though escalation relies heavily on external intervention (the townsman’s entrance).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara realizes some truths must be experienced, not captured. The resonant hush deepens as she exits—a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured with felt cost (no vials collected). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory and memory layer intensifies until the lagoon reweights everything. The compass’s final spin and offering crystallize the before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes when she carves the spiral, foreclosing isolation in favor of timewoven dialogue. The turbine-hum motif reweights meaning, and cost is legible in her rejection of modern navigation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered projections, culminating in a single form that embodies multitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images (postcards, glass, flowers) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: night-blooming as surrender to softer light. Closure lands with felt cost—Elara’s solitude, the passage of seasons—and the dawning hush crystallizes into Charged Poise when she teaches children, foreclosing isolation. Orientation is clear by line 3; transitions between pavilion/cathedral/pavilion are legible. No causality breaks, though escalation relies on revelation over active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diary’s truth reweights civil rights history with undeniable social cost (“truth was complex, fraught with moral dilemmas”). The retrocognitive trap functions causally—each debris arrangement tightens knowledge and stakes. The lagoon’s shimmering visions escalate pressure coherently under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. Cost is legible in Elara’s “profound sense of reverence and responsibility”—a Charged Poise that crystallizes her burden.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density through recurring motifs (lanterns, the bottle, wishes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: civilization reimagined without magic. Closure lands with Earned Stasis—Elian foregoes opening the bottle, accepting its lesson—and cost is legible in the ghost town’s slow, laborious revival. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern of reflection → planning → action is coherent. However, the transition from solitary contemplation to bustling community feels compressed, slightly softening the weight of change.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sounds, languages, and memories until the accidental prophecy breaks the pattern. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the phonograph captures not just emotion but fate, reweighting Elian’s life work with existential cost. The foghorn’s silence anchors time and stakes early, and the final descent carries tangible consequence—the prophecy’s burden—without exposition. Every beat tightens around the central revelation, culminating in a Charged Poise where options (warn or archive?) are legible but unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elara stabilizes the vortex, reopens the portal, and steps through, crystallizing her role as heir. Cost is legible in the empty shell and the irreversible commitment to inherited power. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who/where/when), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. The closure reweights the premise without over-explaining, satisfying elite publishability standards.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated motifs (bell rope, solstice hush, microclimate data) deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—redefining warning as clarity over volume. The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 3. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces noise, foreclosing the old protocol with visible societal impact (villagers respond calmly). Cost is legible—the risk of being wrong—but could be sharper in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density through recurring images. Yet closure lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost: Kael ends where he began—sweeping floors—but now “smiling,” which asserts growth without dramatizing what was lost or foreclosed. The meteor shower functions as backdrop, not catalyst; no option is narrowed, no price paid. The ending offers stasis, not Earned Stasis, because no path is visibly renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the covenant unravels not through action but shared understanding, with ghosts dissolving into renewed life—a before/after legible through bees returning and plants stirring. Cost is felt conceptually: the recluse bears eternal guardianship so silence endures. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (honey scent, phantom hives) until the box’s stillness reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 2; no causality breaks, though the inciting incident (ghosts appearing) lacks explicit cause.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (urn fragment, garage sale messages, emerald silo) until the climax reweights time as tapestry. Orientation is clear by line 30: Elara, emerald silo, post-Shift world. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—time reframed as melody—with legible cost: Elara abandons measurement for lived experience. The inciting rediscovery directly enables the ending, though the stranger’s arrival borders on convenient coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the snapped string and fallen kite reframe incompleteness as generative, not broken. The burnished hush and feather anchor a before/after shift with felt cost—lost flight, tears transformed into sand drawings. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with sensory density tightening around the central idea. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s death forecloses her personal future but crystallizes interspecies harmony as a living legacy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (copper, oak, stone) until the stag’s bow reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in her weakening body and final diary entry. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30, and the pattern of observation→action→response tightens coherently without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “home was not a place but a chemical memory,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery (footprints, sculptures, amber glow) intensifies to a resonant final image. The tower sequence pays off early disorientation; orientation is clear by line 30. Cost is legible in Elara’s earned stillness and relinquished skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through lyrical repetition and image layering rather than causal cause-effect. Orientation is strong by line 3 (who: coachman; where: jetty; when: twilight after reef’s death). Closure manifests as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where peace supplants war through ritualized planting. Cost is conceptual (the erasure of memory through growth) and legible in the final image, though not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Baron reinterprets distance as purpose, with conceptual cost—the acceptance that Elara’s voice is gone, replaced by coordinates. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: pattern of sound + memory intensifies to a cadence shift at decoding. Orientation is solid by line 3; no disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in the silent cylinder and fading scrapyard—loss exchanged for direction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Kaelen crystallizes purpose without yet acting on it, foreclosing passive vigilance with the cost of defying his assigned role. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (compass, sketching, silence) until the star’s appearance breaks the pattern, reweighting everything. Orientation is solid by line 3 (“time dilation observation deck,” “station’s shutdown”). Cost is legible: he abandons sanctioned solitude for uncertain journey, risking sanction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who, where, when) by line 3, and the causal chain—climb → swap → place sundial lid → mend sky—is clean and motivated. Closure is a Decisive Change: the sky heals, the Unweaving halts, and Kaelen departs with new knowledge. Cost is legible in the white queen now “a part of him”—a conceptual price paid through earned ritual. The inferred lens is Causal, held consistently, with no retroactive patches or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: Elara’s walking patterns intensify meaning through cadence shifts (“remember” → “listen” → “forgive” → “hope” → “peace”), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where absence becomes potential. Cost is legible—the missing pawns symbolize lost lives, and her act of spelling “forgive” enacts self-release with emotional weight. The closure reconfigures the interregnum from void to fertile ground, fully earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: home redefined as “a pattern of connections” and “wherever she chose to nurture connection,” with visible emotional cost in Elara’s shift from substituted realities to raw presence. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (feather, stone, thunder) until the cadence shifts at the stone’s warm pulse. Anchors (who: Elara; where: mountain bookstore; when: nightly ritual) are clear by line 30. The glyphs’ final image crystallizes a before/after legible in posture, perception, and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (labyrinth, tapestry, thunder) until the pattern break—a newly revealed thread sequence—reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elian forgives himself, foreclosing his exile identity with felt cost (loss of title, home, trust). The woven hush and frozen time serve functional disorientation early but pay off by enabling undistracted confrontation with memory. Cost is legible in the final image: “He had winnowed away the chaff of his self-pity.”

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes refract meaning, deepening thematic density until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing—the price of forgiveness is redefined as carrying all refracted truths. Orientation is immediate (“canyon of endless echoes,” “towers of bone,” Elara before the spire). The bell-imposed timeframe tightens pressure, and the ending delivers Charged Poise: options and stakes are legible, with undeniable conceptual cost in the forged hush thick with multiplied meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts as Elian descends, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where memories are quilted into permanence. Cost is legible—the crumbling statue, burning lungs, groaning workshop—and the closure image (golden-hued charm, flickering hope) reweights the premise without tidy resolution. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality remains coherent within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “temporary eternity” from something to preserve into something to release, crystallized in her returning the shell. Cost is legible—the cracked mirror becomes “a new pattern,” her satchel lighter, her heart unburdened. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring motifs (shell, mirror, tide) until the cave revelation breaks the pattern. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“old dock,” “salt-stung present”), and the wrong turn functions as a taught complication, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s belief is validated not by reunion but by the echo of return, crystallizing hope into tangible effect. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the scent, light, and vibrations layer into a crescendo that reweights silence as power. Cost is legible in the year-long wait and the emotional vulnerability of calling without guarantee. The cobalt lighthouse’s shift from relief to beacon mirrors this conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts pain rather than erases it, reconfiguring the “geography of loss” from terra incognita to charted map. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds resonance through repeated lunar/censer/phone motifs that deepen in meaning, culminating in the self-realization. Cost is legible: the hydraulics remain dead; forward motion comes only through backward emotional excavation. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“patchwork navigator named Elara,” “starlit signal station”), and the single scene holds pressure without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and recurring motifs (storm, orchard, glass eye) until the ritual climax reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara achieves Charged Poise—truth remains, but speech is now optional—with visible cost (the inert eye, unknown consequences). Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is maintained via the discredited textbooks guiding action. The ending crystallizes options without false resolution, satisfying all closure criteria with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (Edelweiss, twilight, mist) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: isolation revalued as chosen solitude. Closure lands with tangible cost—the relinquishing of borrowed memories—and the final image of the lighthouse beam against stars crystallizes Charged Poise. The pattern is taught early (“gaps in the journal”), and the ending reweights all prior silence. No causality breaks; the journal’s gaps credibly fuel Elias’s inferences.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian steps back, accepting solitude, with visible cost (rising water, fading glimmer). The causal chain—chip → ants → fissure → cavern → doorway—is tight, intuitive yet grounded, and escalates under a Causal lens. The creek’s rise creates urgency that narrows options credibly. One flaw: the ants’ role borders on coincidental guidance, slightly weakening agency, though their return at the end retroactively justifies them.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara reconfigures her role from disenchanted ruler to cosmic guardian, with felt cost in the extinguished fireflies and “lacy menace” woven into her reign. The causal chain—dreams → warning → ascent → vision → duty—is tight and motivated. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30, and the Accumulative/Textural lens (density of celestial imagery intensifying to the grotto) holds coherently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory and conceptual density until Kael’s whispered secret triggers a Conceptual Repricing—“the nexus isn’t fading, it’s dreaming.” This reframing reweights everything, culminating in Earned Stasis: Elara becomes a “guardian of moments,” foreclosing her prior alchemical detachment. Cost is legible—the relinquishment of control for communion—and the closure image (nexus glowing anew) crystallizes the before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he endures the horror of premonition by transmuting it into narrative, foreclosing paralysis with visible cost (aching hand, imperfect scroll). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered past selves, culminating in the birch bark’s pulsing light as Charged Poise. Orientation anchors instantly (“mountain ranger cabin”), and the dream transition is taught early, paying off in the soaring reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the final line: the grave becomes “just another part of the story,” a conceptual repricing with emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building through layered images (fog, water clocks, the screw) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: healing redefined beyond scent. Closure is earned via Charged Poise—the birthing clamp screw becomes a talisman of reframed purpose, with legible cost (her identity stripped of its core sense). Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3. The only flaw: the transition from shop to client feels elided, softening causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara achieves calm by mastering fear, foreclosing her prior state of paralysis with the cost of relinquishing control (crystallized doubts). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via recurring motifs (breath, quill, tea), culminating in a cadence shift at exhalation. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard’s silence deepens, the haunting melody softens, and forgiveness is granted without full reunion—cost felt in the trees’ impending fall. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (scent, sound, shimmering air) until the final image reweights everything. The “forgiven” petal crystallizes the before/after with undeniable emotional and conceptual cost. No causality breaks; every beat serves the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere through repetition, but fails to deliver a closure unit with legible cost. The ending offers thematic resonance but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after state tangible. Key terms like “spiral arbitration” and “universe’s hiccup” are evoked without altering options or knowledge in scene. The library’s dissolution feels decorative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shepherd redefines time not as flow but as friction, with cost legible in his relinquished need for control (the key becomes symbolic, not functional). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring motifs (razor edges, squinting, backward count), culminating in a cadence shift at “he ceased counting.” Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is internal but coherent, and the final stillness earns its poise through layered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (laser, barrier, familiar stranger) until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: security redefined as adaptive dialogue. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquishment of rigid control—a conceptual price made tangible in the system-wide update and softened barriers. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the escalation (alarm → encounter → harmonization → revolution) tightens meaning without causal breaks. The final image of inner clarity charged by bioluminescence fulfills Earned Stasis with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood and motif toward a Conceptual Repricing at the library. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara accepts paradox and commits to teaching wisdom, with felt cost (her father’s death-in-life). Yet the cryptic scrawls function as deus ex machina—they lack mechanics or failure, reducing causality. The transition from subway to library lacks narrative friction, relying on coincidence over agency.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights her ending as a beginning, with cost legible in her silence before “Thank you.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the harmonica’s cadence, tunnel hum, and repeated phrases deepen meaning without causal breaks. Orientation is immediate (“last underground phone booth… beneath the city”), and the single scene tightens around one stake: how to begin after an ending. The final image of Leo waiting reaffirms his renunciation with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail and recurring motifs until the covenant’s renewal crystallizes in the locket’s glow—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: the jetty won’t be saved physically, only from oblivion, a poignant trade-off rendered in the final lines. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality remains intact via ritual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cure isn’t a potion but reciprocal vulnerability, reweighting the premise with social cost (ongoing effort, imperfect results). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via ivy, rumor chains, and shared stories until the station becomes a “living heart.” Cost is legible in Elara’s abating but persistent loneliness and the endless chain of obligation. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara doesn’t “fix” grief but integrates it into a bearable composition, foreclosing the path of resistance with palpable cost—loneliness endures, yet meaning emerges. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ultrasonic density builds until the stillpoint reweights silence as structure, not void. Constellations’ pause functions as both cosmic frame and emotional cadence shift. Every beat tightens toward marrow-resonance without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via Charged Poise—the anomaly softens not through victory but calibrated dialogue, with cost legible in Elara’s trembling hands and the permanent monument of her error. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density builds until the mirrored pulse breaks the noise, reweighting meaning. Orientation is immediate (“sole celestial signal interpreter… hovering in the quiet heart”), and causality holds via relational data cascades. No amnesia, no resets—only reinterpretation with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (silence, moonlight, camera, sign language) that crescendo into a Conceptual Repricing: silence is not absence but latent music. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Elian stood on the weathered dock…”), and the single-scene harbor setting remains spatially coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elian alone but transformed, clutching the camera as a vessel of new perception—with undeniable emotional cost. The advisor’s fade feels inevitable, not convenient, and the moonlit frame holds the arc together.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each artistic artifact deepening thematic density and reweighting Kaelen’s mission. Orientation is clear by line 3; the vandalized portrait functions as both obstacle and map, driving causality without coincidence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the promise “knowledge should be shared freely” reframes Kaelen’s entire arc, with cost visible in his renunciation of fire-as-purge. The final image—mended tapestry carried into shadows—makes the before/after legible with resonant poise.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (drumming, lagoon, starlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the curse becomes a catalyst for unity. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara perched, waiting, the dream dormant but alive—with conceptual cost (exhaustion, isolation, perpetual labor). Orientation is clear by line 30; the pattern is taught early and paid off. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the “cosmic inhalation” is atmospheric, not causal, slightly weakening pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the geomagnetic storm and whisper motif deepening through layered beats that culminate in Conceptual Repricing: whispers reweight communication itself. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara’s folded map and calm exit crystallize her stance with undeniable resonance. Cost is legible in Kael’s surrendered bluster and the dockworkers’ rescued panic. Orientation is immediate, causality tight, and every beat serves the thematic crescendo without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through light-patterns that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: darkness learns to cherish stars. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—the canal sleeps peacefully, Elara’s task complete, with the cost being the unspoken sorrow she bears alone. Orientation is anchored early (“cobalt dock,” “Elara,” “post-storm hush”), and the pattern of shutter-weaving pays off cohesively. The half-spoken secret softens but isn’t broken—a resonant, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated images (windows, chess pieces, grotto) deepen thematic resonance without causal plot turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the town’s collective doubt reweights societal obedience—and carries conceptual cost (the Council’s bafflement, invisible leadership). Orientation is solid by line 30; timeline (“tonight… midnight… next day”) tracks cleanly. The pattern of monthly displays offers Charged Poise: options are reconfigured, stakes crystallized, all without overt confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s surrender reconfigures her identity with undeniable cost—the loss of her known world—and the scrimshaw’s dissolution crystallizes this. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (grime, bone, surf) builds to the island’s materialization, and the whale’s call acts as a pattern-taught pressure that deepens stakes. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene adheres to scope. Cost is legible in the final image: “the world she left behind seemed to fade.”

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (turbines, whittling, bouquet) until the final image crystallizes into Charged Poise: Elara endures, neither smiling nor crying, with visible cost in her moral compromise and emotional desiccation. Orientation is immediate (“farmhouse,” “Elara,” “after the Happiness Mandate”), and the closure reweights all prior acts—the dried flowers, the narration, the compliance—as futile yet necessary rituals. The remade hush and turbine shadows function as persistent constraints that shape every beat, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ban’s basis in fear, not sacred principle, reweights the entire premise with social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of lyrical imagery intensifies toward a cadence shift at the thawing lake. Orientation is solid by line 30. However, the “decisive change” lacks tangible consequence beyond atmosphere; no path is foreclosed, only opened, weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory detail, symbolic objects, and thematic repetition until Elian’s internal shift reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—his “awakening” reframes beauty without literal color vision, with clear cost (renouncing fixation on hue). The phoenix’s rise anchors time early, and the courtyard’s logic holds throughout. Cost is legible in the final image: music returns, but sight does not—yet he gains deeper vision.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held rigorously: density increases through layered sonic imagery until the prism-song symphony crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the lab transforms from archive to “living organ”—with conceptual cost legible in Elara’s realization that connection requires context. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation is minimal and early anchors (“Laboratory of Lost Sounds,” “miner’s carbide lamp lens”) ground the reader. One decisive intensification—the atrium projection—reweights the entire premise, satisfying escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through recurring symbols (origami, stencil, curtains) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: grief as a comma, not a full stop. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the permanent lamp replacing natural light, the open curtains signaling irreversible commitment—and the pattern is taught early (first crane at ~10%). Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elara; where: observatory; when: after daughter’s death). The final image of the open curtains and steady star-like ardor crystallizes Charged Poise with legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated phrases (“by multiplying paths,” “reverse engineering”), but this becomes redundant rather than intensifying. Orientation is solid early, yet the structure suffers from paraphrase loops that mimic progression without causal tightening. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing—human patterns are cyclical—but cost is abstract (“another unraveling”) with no on-page forfeiture or concrete consequence to crystallize stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces innocence to become a vessel of purified nostalgia, with visible cost (exhaustion, tears, transformed identity). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory detail, memory fragments, and ritual cadence until twilight deepens into night and atoms cohere. Cost is legible in “tears traced paths... yet she smiled” and the saffron veil’s re-signification. No causality breaks; pattern-avoidance shapes the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: hope is preserved but “less true,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via dream comparisons, culminating in metamorphosis. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“dusk noticer of the Aerie…”). The river stone’s activation and shadow’s shift form a coherent, earned climax without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara refuses to let theft define her sanctuary, crystallizing a new balance between openness and protection. Cost is legible in the “raw spot” on the chameleon and her shed layers—each loss (naivete, bitterness, fear) tightens her resolve. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated “shedding” motifs deepen into resilience. No causality breaks; the con’s aftermath pressures every beat coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aris accepts his wound as a gateway, foreclosing his old quest with conceptual cost made visible in the hourglass restarting. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layers (ivy whispers, coffee rings, root-thoughts) until the chamber crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“quiet tower at dawn”), and causality flows from consistent rules (plant telepathy → tunneling). Cost is legible in the scar’s recontextualization and the hourglass’s resumed flow.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s resolve crystallizes with visible emotional cost (“hushed thunder of resolution settling in her heart”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering, lyrical cadence, and motif recurrence until the final hum reweights everything. Orientation is immediate (“dust-moted silence of the vintage movie palace projection booth”), and the film strip’s psychometric transfer creates a clean before/after. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the inert strip and her new burden.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with lyrical density building toward a Conceptual Repricing: creativity as eternal stardust. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara’s rest is dynamic creation, not escape—and cost is felt in her enduring vigilance. Yet the inciting incident and climax blur; the falling star triggers insight without prior failed attempts, weakening escalation. Orientation is clear early, but pressure tightens more through repetition than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s cultivation of sparks reconfigures her relationship to time and self, crystallized in the chess clock shifting from “prison” to “promise.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (lullaby, dune, archive) until the fractured melody smooths into renewal. Cost is legible: her hollowness deepens with each act, yet peace emerges only after collective ignition. Orientation is immediate (“After the last forest burned...”), and causality flows through wave-function logic without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: fixing the machine unlocks consciousness, reweighting translocation from disruption to “dance of discovery.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of resonant imagery (wind tones, hum, gear) intensifies toward a cadence shift at climax. Cost is legible in lost stability (unpredictable sleep-jumps) traded for insight. Orientation is deliberately disorienting early but pays off coherently in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal plot turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands alone yet whole, the star sigil affirming internal transformation. Cost is legible in the broken leash (loss of safety) and the relinquished past. The indirect route itself becomes the crucible—no false resets, no amnesia, no telegraphed mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory and symbolic density until the final Charged Poise: Elian’s silent resolve reconfigures the meaning of safety. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt fortress,” “bellhop of the silent-choir”), and the discoloration-to-bolt discovery forms a coherent, taught pattern. Closure delivers Conceptual Repricing—truth as the buried cost of sanctuary—with undeniable emotional and social weight legible in the final image of thawing hope.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rune of drift enacts a “graceful collapse” that reweights the story’s core rule—truth erodes falsehood not by violence but inevitability. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through layered imagery (ink, dust, constellations) that crescendos into the final unraveling. Cost is legible in the usurper’s fading form and the library’s sigh—a conceptual price paid by deception itself. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: data, memory, and sensory detail accrue until the atlas page reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—nature’s resilience reframes loss as benchmark. Cost is legible in Kaelen’s lifted sorrow and stilled tapping. One tightening (data correlation revealing reemergent paths) suffices, though escalation lacks visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (graffiti, stones, hum) until the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stance crystallizes with legible cost—the rebellion’s dormancy, her isolation—and the stone circle’s activation forecloses passive waiting. The inciting discovery (the stones) emerges organically from setting and character action. No causality breaks; the hum’s escalation ties perception to transformation without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Elara decodes the kite’s script, therefore she finds the chamber; because she resonates with the embryo, therefore the community transforms. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “implanted destiny” reframed as potential, not prophecy—with clear conceptual cost: abandoning blind restoration. The final image of thriving traditions legibly reconfigures the premise, and the persistent constraint (rigid council plans) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (photograph, lighthouse, grafting), and cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake—enduring grief without surrendering hope. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara refuses paralysis, choosing to graft new life onto old loss. The cost is legible in her trembling hands and whispered names; the automated lighthouse beam crystallizes her solitude and resolve. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern pays off cohesively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian’s stance crystallizes in the final act of drawing his map, with visible cost—the destruction of past work, social rejection, and embrace of necessary darkness. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: pressure builds via sensory density (cracking walls, luminescent ache) and cadence shifts, culminating in perceptual reconfiguration. Cost is legible in “the walls receded... their pressure replaced by vast, quiet space”—a hard-won internal shift earned through recursive memory work.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: coherent pressure (the experiment) forces Kael’s stance to crystallize into Charged Poise—accepting time’s subjectivity as survival mechanism. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the realization reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the mystery dissolves into biological utility). Orientation is immediate (“The eclipse ended… Kael… stood…”), and causality remains intact within the speculative framework. The ink’s evaporation directly enables the transition, making the climax both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: quiet intensifies into charged poise via sensory and rhythmic buildup. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the truth is no longer preserved but circulating—and carries conceptual cost (archivists vanished, council’s lies exposed). However, the upload lacks tangible resistance; alarms “should have sounded” but don’t, deflating tension. The “blink” timeframe is noted but doesn’t constrict action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (roses, quiet, sheathing). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s refusal of violence becomes a generative act, with cuttings spreading her ethos—a resonant reconfiguration charged by the engraved quiet. Cost is conceptual (the world’s chaos persists) but legible in the final image. The pattern is taught early, transitions are smooth, and the ending crystallizes meaning without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo captured not by force but harmonization, ending the constellations’ sleepwalk—a Charged Poise where balance replaces conquest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic patterns fracture, then reconfigure via density shifts in sound and movement. Cost is legible—the goddess’s absence made whole only through Kael’s calibrated calm. Every beat tightens toward this earned stillness, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights the Aethelred legacy from silence to revelation, with felt cost in her shattered idealization of her father. The Causal lens holds—each discovery (mill closures, payoffs) narrows options until contradiction fails and confession becomes necessary. The observatory setting anchors time and place by line 30, satisfying orientation. Final image crystallizes Charged Poise: she answers not as heiress but witness, with legacy irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures guilt not by erasing it but by reconfiguring its meaning through action. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density and pattern (letters, amber, cries) until the final lullaby reweights all prior dissonance. Cost is legible in the “dull ache she could carry without breaking.” Orientation is clear by line 30; time folds serve closure by enabling the apology letter conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mandala reframes chaos as connection, transforming “lilac unease” into “lavender clarity.” Cost is legible—the temporary mandala blurs immediately, affirming impermanence as part of meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers intensify, then hush deepens into shared understanding. Final image (“quiet companion on the path”) crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, stakes felt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds until the chipped mosaic patterns catalyze a Conceptual Repricing—renaming as rebirth. Closure lands via Charged Poise: “Aeliana” walks forward, empathy now “the strongest steel,” with cost legible in the loosened but persistent visions. Orientation is clear by line 3; the plaza, fire, and sky anchor time/place. The lens holds coherently, and the final image reweights everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s final bow reconfigures her eternal loop into peace, with visible cost—the relinquishing of encore-seeking. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with nostalgia intensifying into acceptance via echo-layering. Orientation is immediate (“old theater,” “hedge maze,” “Elara”) and functional disorientation (fractured time) pays off in the ending’s temporal synthesis. Cost is legible in the orchard’s sigh and her fading smile.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: light trails, somatic markers, and fractal imagery layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the fragile “willowglass hope” that connection may persist despite illness—and the static shock functions as a taught disorientation that pays off in heightened perception. One tightening occurs when Alex shifts from passive recollection to active light-painting, narrowing his method to somatic precision. No causality breaks, though the telepathy pill’s mechanics remain vague without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen becomes “the voice of the unknown,” crystallizing stakes with conceptual cost—the silence of the post-human world now carries weight through him. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: heat-maps intensify, patterns deepen, and cadence shifts from observation to embodiment. Orientation is immediate (“coastal cave networks… sea’s whisper”), and the elm fossil’s float serves as the decisive pattern break that reweights meaning. No causality breaks; every escalation stems from Kaelen’s active mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy transforms from sentence to seed, with visible cost in the dissolution of rigid fate and reconfiguration of possibility. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via button cataloging, pattern recognition, and canyon echo integration, culminating in the hourglass sands shifting color. Every beat advances knowledge or stakes without causal breaks; the “unraveling truth” timeframe tightens focus without artificial compression.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias sacrifices himself to transmit truth, foreclosing his survival with visible cost (“bleeding, but he smiled”). The Causal lens holds—each beat links via because/therefore (snow codes → cabin → drive decryption → transmission). One flaw: the enemy agents’ arrival feels slightly convenient, though it doesn’t resolve the climax. Cost is legible in the final image of Anya cradling the pillbox.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the palimpsest promise is reweighted from guilt to growth, with the cessation of gutter-ticking marking a ritualized boundary. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered reflection, not causal turns—and it holds coherently. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of solitude and years lost, though no physical or relational consequence manifests on the page. The structure adheres to Track A defaults cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: kindness anchors time, making resistance to change legible and eternal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and timeline shimmering until the lantern’s glow reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: Kael’s detachment shatters into connection, altering his path. The chimney smoke’s flattening functions as both temporal marker and emotional pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with moonlight, oars, and silence building a resonant pattern that culminates in Charged Poise: Elara’s act of reflection reconfigures darkness as penetrable, not absolute. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the rose’s death necessitates active hope—and the rhythm of rowing serves as both structure and metaphor. Orientation is immediate (“luminous harbor by moonlight,” “fire escape gardener”), and the single scene coheres tightly. The bud’s appearance avoids sentimentality by tying renewal to prior action (mirror work), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara renounces flight from memory and accepts guardianship, with clear conceptual cost—the extinction of her people becomes her foundation, not her burden. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via recurring motifs (sundial, hum, brittle awakenings) until the cadence shift at the stone circle reweights her stance. Orientation is immediate (“Tidal Library… above the rolling clouds”), and causality remains intact within the lyrical mode. The final image—sundial measuring spirit-progress—makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail, whispered confessions, and the expanding spiral until the final Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: vulnerability as the connective thread. Cost is legible in Elara’s shedding of emotional armor (“felt lighter, as if she had shed a skin”) and the irreversible shift from proxy to authentic voice. Orientation is anchored immediately; closure is resonant, precise, and charged with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Aris acts *because* the signal fuels chaos, *therefore* he broadcasts, *so* the signal dissolves and tensions ease. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the clean screen and quieting crowds reconfigure the station from listening post to shield, with clear conceptual cost (defying authority, risking scandal). The Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 3. Cost is legible in Evans’s shift from fury to respect and the implied institutional fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmosphere and symbolic resonance toward a Conceptual Repricing: space is what you make of it. Orientation is clear by line 30, and closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara’s wistful smile crystallizes her reconfigured relationship to fear. However, the organ’s mechanics resolve spatial chaos too conveniently; the nexus calms because music plays, not because Elara *earns* control through struggle. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets the ribbon not as evidence of identity but of relational rupture, shifting the town’s frozen narrative from crime to tragedy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory oppositions (velvet vs. granite, masquerade vs. mist)—culminating in a Charged Poise where options are crystallized: tell the story of failed connection, not hunt a villain. Cost is legible in the “empathy [that] had died with it”—a social and emotional void she now shoulders. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: because Elara deciphers the stanzas, she locates the wreck; because she retrieves the nail, the committee exonerates her ancestor. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“remote experimental weather station,” “Elara,” “atmospheric archives”). Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the reversal of exile—and the copper nail’s retrieval directly enables it. One tightening (from dread to frantic energy upon discovering the truth) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (glass flake, scaffold flutters, pixelated amnesty) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: reality is permeable, and absolution arrives in fragments. Closure lands decisively—the hitchhiker’s departure is reinterpreted as transition, not loss—and Elias’s shift from confusion to “luminous disbelief” carries conceptual cost (abandoning linear causality for poetic faith). Orientation is clear by line 30; the pullout, mountain, and vanished hitchhiker anchor time/place effectively. The wet-plate shard’s reappraisal with light and shadow forms a tight, resonant causal loop.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Leo renounces the cycle not through action but understanding, with visible cost—the abandonment of inherited patterns—and crystallized in the final image of stepping onto an “unmarked and unknown” path. The Causal lens holds throughout: each beat follows because/therefore logic (startup failure → pilgrimage → confrontation → insight). Cost is legible in the dusky harmony wrapping “peace and sorrow,” making before/after unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently: rhythmic stellar pulses accrue into thematic resonance, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—“the temple inscriptions were a manual for empathy.” Cost is legible in Elara’s solitude and inherited burden, crystallized in the daylily telegram’s transformation. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and symbolic density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the confession’s release reweights the lake’s curse and Elara’s identity. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the closure—truth spoken, vortex calmed, self unlocked—is decisive with felt cost (the crumbling seed, lifted secrecy). The frozen confession’s thaw via the flesh-eating seed is causally coherent within the established magic system. No lens drift or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: Elara’s transformation from rootedness to “bridges of light” constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with clear cost—the dissolution of her old bond, symbolized by the clipping turning to starlight. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating sensory density (cobalt hues deepening, shadows stretching) culminating in the portal’s emergence. Cost is legible in the final image: freedom gained through acceptance of shared wounds. Orientation is strong from line one (“cobalt glade,” “Elara,” “dusk”), and causality remains intact despite lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of bone-root-card imagery intensifies until the final reconfiguration where the burned card is woven into the oak’s roots—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights “bartered destinies” as honored, not erased. Cost is legible in Elara’s surrender of control and the keeper’s rebuke carving into her. Orientation anchors immediately (“catacomb orchard,” “boots whispering”), and the single scene tightens coherently around one dominant stake: mending the soul through symbolic acts. Closure lands with undeniable resonance and earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (grille cloth, echo valley longing) deepen until the final reconfiguration crystallizes as Charged Poise—framing the cloth signals a new identity without erasing loss. Cost is legible in Leo’s forfeited illusion of mastery and embraced hybridity. The single-scene structure holds, though the transition from despair to resolve lacks a tactile middle beat that would make the turn feel inevitable rather than aspirational.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: magnetic pulses, seed glow, and cuneiform parallels build density until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing—transition understood as resonance, not force. Cost is legible in Elian’s transformed relationship to ambition (“once haunted… now purified”) and the arbor’s realignment. Orientation is immediate (“Elian… stood alone in the magnetic arbor”), and the single scene holds coherent pressure. The spirit’s absence isn’t a gap but the engine of accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via rhythmic repetition of smelting acts, deepening with each identity until the final Charged Poise—Elian hanging the empty creel under stars—reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible: identities would shatter without his intervention; the “wintersun serenity” carries the weight of eternal recurrence. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elian; where: tidal atrium; when: after tomorrow disappears). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—his refusal to abandon the cycle despite its futility—charged by the bamboo creel’s symbolic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen’s decision to embed hope into future inspections reconfigures his professional identity with visible cost—abandoning pure survivalism. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds through layered confessions, culminating in the pearl’s activation. Cost is legible in his tears and reframed mission. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara doesn’t erase her past but integrates it into her identity as chronicler, signaled by the reweighted map and repaired relationship with music. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (river, accordion, map) until the graffiti line triggers a cadence shift into acceptance. Cost is legible: the tape on the bellows symbolizes mended-but-not-whole resilience, and her lighter steps imply emotional burden lifted. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-shard structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (cipher, delays, reversals) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara enters the library as the watch stills, achieving Earned Stasis through perseverance. Orientation is strong by line 3 (who, where, when), and the cyclical reversal mechanic pays off coherently at the threshold. However, the final “beep” threat lacks tangible cost—no path is truly foreclosed, and the resolution relies on documented notes without new sacrifice. Closure lands with conceptual weight but minimal felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: empires fall, forests rise, and Elara’s choice reweights the story’s entire premise with undeniable cost—the melting violin, the fading promise, the lingering ache. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory layering (velvet, ice, coffee stains, plant whispers) until the final cadence shift crystallizes stakes. Coffee-stain prophecy functions as motivated ellipsis that pays off in the climax. The cost is legible in “the violin melted slowly… leaving only a memory of cold and sound.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through auroral imagery, ritualized action, and lyrical repetition. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara completes her duty, foreclosing further intervention with the quiet cost of carrying countless sparks. The threshold of stillness deepens coherently, and the emerald chip’s luminescence marks a decisive intensification. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality remains intact within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (scallop, hairpin, climbing) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: rebirth as lived practice, not myth. Closure lands with conceptual cost—Elara accepts renewal over resistance—but the “soft glow” revelation risks feeling convenient. The structure adheres to Track A defaults, with one meaningful deepening (the alcove discovery) that reweights her understanding without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes into “adaptable intentions,” reweighting her initial binary with conceptual cost (abandoning absolute answers). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—wind chimes, mirror, and cloak build density until the dawn crescendo reframes possibility. Orientation is immediate (“breezy lighthouse at dawn”), and the single scene tightens cleanly around one stake. Cost is visible in Elara’s shudder and Aris’s rare satisfaction—proof the transaction altered both.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael reweights reality by dissolving the illusion of separation, with visible cost (loss of self) and resonant payoff (“we are all patterns in the pond”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through metaphor, grotto magnetism, and trance deepening. Orientation is immediate (“floating rock meditation platform”), and the delayed revelation pays off without retroactive patches. Final image crystallizes the before/after with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns (birds, echoes, dust layers) intensify toward a Conceptual Repricing—“true navigation arises from inner harmony.” Closure lands with undeniable cost: Elara foregoes physical travel forever, integrating the arrowhead into its essence. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“canyon,” “towers of bone,” “Elara”), and the pulse’s anchoring crystallizes stakes. The final image reweights all prior motifs without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned imagery (luminance, mist, keystone) deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing: simplicity as sacred. Closure lands via Earned Stasis—Elian renounces automation’s noise, foreclosing that path—and the spire’s transformation embodies cost through altered reality. However, the inciting discovery (loose stone) lacks causal buildup; it appears without prior tactile or spatial grounding, relying on convenience. The journey’s “treacherous” nature is asserted, not dramatized, weakening pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images—lanterns, light, silence—until the submerged library crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s perception is permanently altered, and the cost is legible in his silent vow and changed relationship to his work. The sky lanterns, key tag, and luminous vows cohere into a resonant final image where “the pier became a place of endless wonder.” No causality breaks; every beat flows from Elias’s purposeful wandering, and the meteor hush deepens as both atmosphere and thematic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (coins, static, amber light) until a decisive cadence shift crystallizes meaning: contraction is transformation. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“ambered observatory deck, suspended in the void”), and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing—lands with undeniable cost: Elara accepts her role as eternal witness, foreclosing personal resolution for cosmic continuity. The pattern is taught early, sustained, and pays off in a final image that reweights all prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crystallized echo becomes a permanent monument that reweights grief from wound to companion. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through recurring phrases, light patterns, and sea monsters until the final pulse reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the quiet acceptance that replaces heartbreak, and the observatory’s lingering light embodies enduring consequence. The structure is a single shard with flawless orientation and no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rhythmic observation of dripping rates builds density until the bell’s ring reweights silence into sound. Closure is a Decisive Change—the river revives—with conceptual cost (years of failure, blood sacrifice) legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate and precise. One tightening (fragment slips → cut finger) deepens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: photographs, memories, and voices layer into a resonant reconfiguration (RR) via Charged Poise—the final image of shared murmurs reweights silence as connection. Cost is legible: Elias expunges personal guilt by surrendering solitary vigilance for collective meaning. The wind chime’s silence-to-murmur arc crystallizes this shift with conceptual cost (loss of isolation, gain of responsibility). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality flows through patterned accumulation, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s unified soul crystallizes options without physical action, and cost is legible in her relinquished dichotomy (“no longer feared the dichotomy of her nature”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via starlings, waterfall, crystal—and the grandmother’s wisdom reweights prior material. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory and conceptual density until the static clears and data coheres. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the soundless echo transforms from void to canvas, reweighting solitude as purpose. Cost is legible—the weight of isolation and perpetual vigilance—and the parachute buckle’s recurrence ties past survival to present resolve. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story opens with strong orientation (floating dojo, rewriting history) and builds causally toward Kael’s decisive act: merging essences. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + Earned Stasis)—history stabilizes, custody dissolves, and Kael regains feeling at tangible emotional cost. The causal chain holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture of flickering history + Causal protagonist choice). No amnesia or retroactive fixes; the jar’s role pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with the seed functioning as a resonant object that gathers symbolic weight. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the seed reweights from mystery to catalyst, affirming Elara’s stance. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure from the corporate threat is recalled, not dramatized, and no live option is foreclosed. Cost is implied (her defiance) but not rendered visible or felt in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: laughter returns but “tinged with the wisdom of loss,” a Charged Poise where joy and sorrow coexist irreversibly. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered sound motifs until the giggle pierces through. Cost is legible in the “ghost of what was” haunting restored laughter. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“echo chamber tunnel,” “Conductor”), and the hourglass timeframe tightens pressure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the guardian redefines “home” as uncertainty itself, dissolving boundaries in a resonant final image. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—repetition of “wait,” “veil of sleep,” and “interiorized” builds density until the pendant shatters, thinning light like parchment. Cost is legible: abandoning the garden/library duality for fluid unity. Orientation is clear by line 3, and disorientation serves closure via foggy lucidity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each failed attempt informs the next (successive approximation), culminating in a decisive act of creative destruction that shatters then reconstitutes the crozier. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the irreversible loss of the old staff—and the Ember Nexus setting directly enables the transformation. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the drive lens holds coherently through climax. The cost is legible in “for a heart-stopping moment, Elian feared he had doomed his quest,” grounding the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs until the static clears into a pure tone—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence as fullness. Orientation is immediate and precise: who (Elara), where (radio tower over gorge), when (lunar perigee). Cost is legible in the renunciation of loudness-as-meaning and the shift from broadcast to reception. Closure lands with Charged Poise: Elara walks away tuned, the gorge now a cradle, not an abyss.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the *Sea-Sprite* materializes via Eli’s earned act, fulfilling a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—the ferry’s restoration implies reconciliation of fractured selves across timelines. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with patterns of light, radio static, and starlight building density toward union. Orientation is immediate and functional (“damp planks,” “cold starlight”), and the grotto’s rules are dramatized, not exposited. A hairline slip: the chorus of other Elis arrives abruptly without prior signal, slightly softening causality—but it serves the accumulative logic and doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (sinew thread, shifting gallery) until the eruption triggers a Conceptual Repricing: Elara realizes she *is* the connection. The closure—Charged Poise—is unmistakable: she accepts her role as architect of rewritten reality, with the cost being the loss of stable memory. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of memory alteration pays off in the final forest-of-trees image. One flaw: the eruption’s cause isn’t fully dramatized—it feels more like a narrative inevitability than a consequence of specific prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s realization that “true navigation began not with maps, but with the courage to look up” crystallizes into Charged Poise—the ocean becomes a launchpad, not a prison. Cost is legible in the somber marvel and historical loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via star charts, alien contact, and pedagogical evolution, culminating in thematic and emotional cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by ~60 words; causality remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures the weight of remembrance, foreclosing Eleanor’s silence with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pulses intensify, mist parts, photograph warms—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where voice becomes legacy. Orientation is immediate (“atrium,” “twilight,” “hearing aid”), and causality flows through sensory escalation rather than plot mechanics. Final image crystallizes the before/after: hush transforms from reeling to resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures the facility’s transitions to honor the dead, foreclosing escape until completion, with tidal pressure enforcing real stakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the “crashing hush” deepens into “respectful quiet,” reweighting atmosphere with emotional cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact. One tightening (tidal window) suffices, though a second meaningful escalation would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara ceases counting heartbeats, integrating failure without erasing loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via ink patterns that reconfigure memory into wisdom. Cost is legible in the porcelain shard’s transformation from fracture to relic. Orientation is immediate (“opale observatory… buried under snow”) and functional disorientation (ghost, static) pays off in closure’s quiet clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and echo motifs until the climax reweights everything via Conceptual Repricing: language isn’t preserved by domination but by resonance. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“canyon of bone,” “sky the color of dried blood”), and causality flows through pattern recognition (birds → tunnel → diamond → voice). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara doesn’t retrieve or destroy the diamond but aligns with its flaw, accepting that translation requires surrender to imperfection. Cost is legible—the language still dies, but its essence may survive in a new form.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and recurring motifs until the static swells into “harmony untamed.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s gravitational play shifts from sorrow to joy, with visible cost in the changed ones’ metamorphosis and the phone’s silence. The arrowhead’s activation at the heart triggers a decisive intensification that reweights all prior elements. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story delivers a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s mechanical order collapses as the statues awaken, with visible cost—the extinguished crystal, the crumbling locust shell—and a decisive change in the world’s state. Causality is tight: the locust shell inspires the plan, the heartbeat rhythm triggers the Warden’s awakening, and the statues’ uprooting follows logically. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and rhythmic density toward a cadence shift at the climax. Closure is fully on-page, emotionally legible, and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic weight, but closure lacks a decisive change or legible cost. The drone departs, hope persists—but no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Orientation is strong early, yet the ending offers Charged Poise without stakes crystallized under pressure; the “brittle hush” softens but nothing is irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through density of image and cadence shift—the wind bells’ chime marking sacred intervals, the misting hush evolving into “clean, bright quiet.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s stance crystallizes as creator, not just restorer, with the cost being his lifelong silence broken. The halo fragment’s glow and horses’ postures shifting signal a before/after legible on the page. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and lyrical patterning build until the hyperbolic geometry triggers a Conceptual Repricing—revealing stories as living constellations. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands via Charged Poise as Elara steps into narrative eternity, with felt cost (the scarf’s dissolution) and reconfigured understanding. The analog memories’ activation aligns precisely with escalating textual pressure, satisfying all closure criteria without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara captures the dream not to possess it but to understand it, foreclosing her decade-long chase with visible peace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—light density, palette shimmer, archipelago whispers intensify toward sunrise, reweighting longing into acceptance. Cost is legible in the dimmed palette and silent islands. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (starlight, hair, silence) until the crystalline hint triggers a decisive act. Orientation is solid by line 30: Elian, the shadowed nexus, twilight. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the freed idea reweights reality, with starlight intensifying and shadows recoiling—carrying implicit cost in the inert hair and Elian’s enduring solitude. However, the escalation leans heavily on atmosphere over causal tightening; the disorientation sequence feels like thematic illustration rather than a narrowing of options driven by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: broken constellations intensify through layered images (masts, glass, mushrooms) until alignment triggers closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration—memories restored, water receding—is charged with conceptual cost: balance requires active mending, not passive return. Orientation anchors are immediate (“knee-deep, briny water”), and the single-scene structure fits 600–800-word scope without drift. Cost is legible in the shipwrecks’ groan and Elara’s trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian’s perceptual shift reweights exile as reversible, with visible cost in his relinquished anger. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via recurring patterns (shadows, tea leaves, backward steps) that converge in the final annotation. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten library,” “shard-mirror archivist”), and causality flows through object-based epiphanies rather than plot mechanics. The swing’s creaks function as rhythmic pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: wonder fades, Elara weaves, wonder returns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis via ritual renewal—with the orchard visibly restored. However, causality is thin; the “weaving between worlds” lacks mechanics or stakes, functioning more as metaphor than pressured action. Cost is implied (fading color) but never felt in Elara’s body, time, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (silence, knots, light) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via completed ritual and shared apprenticeship. Orientation is immediate and vivid; who (Elara/Kael), where (prism sanctuary), and when (night) are anchored by line 3. The unraveling of the net drives a single, meaningful tightening—each knot releases silence, escalating atmospheric pressure until the final sigh. Cost is legible in Elara’s enduring unrest and the acknowledgment that “others will come,” foreclosing permanent peace.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (tear, silence, fresco) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes legible language. The closure is earned—the chapel’s reopening reweights the map’s tear from rupture to wholeness—with tangible cost (emotional vulnerability). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact via video comparison driving discovery. The final image crystallizes Charged Poise: options reconfigured, stakes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets letting go not as loss but integration, with the snow globe as key. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (threads, buoyancy, flakes) that reweight the central stake. Cost is legible in her vow to release ghosts and the lightness upon ascent. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory motifs until the ghost’s emergence crystallizes meaning. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s voice is no longer silent because her art now speaks—a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured with felt cost (her prior isolation). The “between lightning and thunder” timeframe tightens causality effectively, though the ghost’s responsiveness leans slightly toward convenience rather than earned reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights anguish through the captain’s lens, crystallizing a new understanding with felt cost (years of solitude, emotional labor). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—prismatic light, floor-by-floor ascent, and layered ink build density that culminates in thematic resonance. Orientation is immediate (“brass elevator cage,” “icebound spire”), and the ten-floor structure tightens pressure without artificial amnesia or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition until the climax: “the sky was not empty, but a library of emotions.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the void redefined as repository—with cost implied in Elias’s prior fear of being forgotten. Yet the inciting condition (“after the string broke”) remains static; no meaningful tightening narrows options or alters tactics, weakening escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory density, ritualistic preparation, and recursive detail until the sky-mural’s completion triggers a Conceptual Repricing—realizing containment negates infinity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara accepts the sky’s transcendence just as machinery rumbles, making the before/after legible with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate (“ancient tree… demolition at dawn”), and the single scene tightens cleanly toward revelation. The safe’s discovery and lens use are motivated by established lore and tactile logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: observation → pattern recognition → decoding → verification → course change. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands at the prow, validated yet still isolated, with the luminance fading as proof of success. Cost is subtle but present—the emotional solitude amid achievement—but could be sharper to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “repair” from force to alignment with natural cycles, crystallized in the hall’s shifting mirrors. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via layered imagery (ice, gears, light), culminating in the vial’s uncap as the decisive act. Cost is legible in the softened nostalgia becoming acceptance, though not physically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: hope transforms from “brambled” to “vine reaching for the sun,” with visible cost in weeks of labor and emotional doubt. The Causal lens holds—each chalked instruction leads to concrete action, culminating in the bell’s activation. The ghost’s purpose fulfilled and departure carry conceptual weight. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the final image (“The garden grows”) reweights all prior struggle without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s whisper completes the lullaby, foreclosing all future action with visible cost (her life force spent, the lighthouse fading). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the nested patterns, recurring images, and cadence shift toward the final hum reweight time itself. Cost is legible in “bruised awe” and the keeper’s rest; the pane of hush thickening isolates her sacrifice. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts her role without escape, foreclosing personal freedom with visible cost (binding herself to future rescues). The causal chain is tight—blueprint → assembly → projection → evasion → guidance—and the night frost deadline creates urgent, narrowing options. The mechanical birds escalate pressure believably, and the travelers’ safe exit is directly tied to Elara’s precise actions. Cost is legible in the dormant nut and her solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the braided ravine, chrysalis, and foam patterns accruing symbolic weight that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: atonement as transformation, not penance. Cost is legible in Aris’s loosened grief and the lab’s new direction. The two-shard structure (ravine → lab) transitions cleanly, and closure lands with resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs until the closure reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 2: Elara, glass orchard library, opening day. The doorway forms, she steps through, returns transformed—closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost (spent moonlight, empty vial). However, the “lull” dissolves without tangible resistance, softening the cost; the first customer arrives too conveniently, slightly undermining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure falters: the “dissolving” of remorse is asserted, not dramatized, and cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clear early, yet the narrative drifts into repetitive lyrical loops without meaningful tightening. The ending offers Charged Poise in tone but fails the Cost Proof Test—no sentence makes loss or transformation legible as irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chiming clock reweights communal identity with undeniable symbolic cost—the villages’ prior isolation now legible as loss. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with patterned motifs (starlight, weight, language) intensifying toward a cadence shift at the climax. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact via character-driven action. No coincidences resolve core conflict—all progress stems from Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through refracted light and layered memories. However, closure lacks legible cost: Elara “feels the transformation complete,” but no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice shown. The Orientation Test passes early (moonlit canyon, lone engineer), but escalation is atmospheric, not causal—pressure never tightens options. Final image offers Charged Poise without felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara reenters the vault, integrates the forgotten combinations, and becomes their guardian—foreclosing retreat with conceptual cost. The inverted-gravity timeframe creates causal pressure that tightens options, and the doodle’s activation aligns precisely with threshold mechanics. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of luminous detail and perceptual shifts reweight reality itself. Cost is legible in the fading manuscript and her irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world’s silence breaks not by force but through attuned listening, reconfiguring Elara’s role from solitary sculptor to conductor of a living choir. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory stillness, then fractures it with a single note whose resonance accumulates meaning. Cost is legible: seasons of silence endured, fragile hope sustained. The porcelain’s discovery and use form a causal chain grounded in character perception, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density increasing through layered silence, magnetic pulses, and geological memory until the final Charged Poise: the covenant “breathing again” reconfigures stakes with felt cost—the irreversible loss of royal trust, the burden of solitary witness. Orientation is immediate (Kael at the nexus at twilight), and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: meaning is unearthed from despair, not restored wholesale. The causal chain is motivated ellipsis—each silence interpreted tightens knowledge—and the final act (stone meeting lodestone) is decisive within the logic. Cost is legible in the “stubborn belief” that persists despite irrevocable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through layered silences until the fireworks rupture the stillness. Orientation is solid by line 30: Elara, workshop, pre-fireworks. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where she chooses enduring quiet over external spectacle, with legible conceptual cost (isolation traded for insight). However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; pressure rises atmospherically but doesn’t force a harder tactical shift beyond “hurry.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and symbolic layering until the seed cracks—a Decisive Change charged with conceptual cost: Elara relinquishes force for harmony. Orientation is immediate (“swaying bridges… treetop village”), and the closure lands with Earned Stasis: her calm acceptance forecloses her old ambition. The “wildflower hush” crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration where collective silence validates her internal shift, fulfilling all closure criteria with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing: Kaelen reweights “resilience” from a biological anomaly to a cultivated, ancestral archive of echoes. The gravity inversion provides a tight causal window that structures the entire sequence, and the ending crystallizes this insight with Charged Poise—options are legible (protect/share), stakes are clear, and the cost (fleeting access) is felt in the fading echoes. Orientation is immediate, and causality holds under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s silence becomes “full of unspoken warnings,” reweighting disaster into prevention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—wind data, patch, debris coalesce into insight. Cost is legible: the patch’s weight symbolizes lives lost, and Elias’s mission crystallizes with “heavy token” consequence. No causality breaks, though the crash site revelation lacks physical stakes beyond observation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density culminating in the aurora-bell fusion that triggers the amber sheet’s release. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: wonder is reweighted from hidden treasure to essential force, with cost legible in the transformed “sculpted hush.” The distant sculptor’s chisel strike synchronizes meaningfully, not coincidentally, as it echoes creation’s dawn—a resonant motif, not deus ex machina. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern holds coherently through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael renounces his old self, foreclosing a path defined by duty alone, with visible cost (lost relics, broken trust). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the repeated “avalanchingly quiet” motif deepens into a charged poise. Driftwood markers and flute use scaffold a coherent ritual that tightens meaning without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the final image: insights remain, but physical proof will weather away.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “The mathematics were not in the feeling, but in the space between feelings,” with undeniable conceptual cost—the abandonment of her life’s method. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; emotional density intensifies via printed sheets until the halo fragment triggers reversal. Every beat tightens the dominant stake, and the final image (“just a cool piece of glass”) crystallizes loss without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through aurora, pendant, and mythic resonance until the final image reweights delivery as storytelling. Orientation is clear by line 3, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kaelen’s role shifts from courier to myth-seeder, with felt cost in Elara’s absence and the weight of legacy. The ridgeway encounter deepens stakes without false causality, though the traveler’s sudden appearance borders on convenient. No structural flaws touch the ending’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s theory is validated, but the cost is personal—her hidden guilt reframes her entire quest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; frost patterns intensify emotionally until the prism reveals her own reflection, reweighting all prior “proofs.” Cost is legible in the final image: the prism’s weight “heavier now with understanding.” Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits the word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara dissolves into memory, permanently stitching time, with tangible cost (her vitality, body, presence). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (amber bead, silence, loom) until a cadence shift at the climax pierces the gloom. Orientation is immediate (“Elara was a wistful loom spinner… forgotten orchard”), and the pattern pays off cohesively. Cost is legible in the final image: the bead on the ground, the empty loom, Liam’s whispered reply.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated motifs (rubble, arches, silk) deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing where resilience becomes communal. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elian’s forge glows as a beacon, foreclosing isolation with felt cost (his meekness shed). However, the mine-to-mage-to-forge progression leans on summary over dramatized beats, flattening causal pressure. The “bartered awakening” lacks on-page consequence beyond knowledge transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory echoes, layered visions, and rhythmic intensification until the climactic rift. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the “weight” of withheld truth transforms from abstract yearning to felt sacrifice, reweighting Kaelen’s entire past. Cost is legible in the final image—truth integrated, shard discarded, silence aching—and the repair bay’s residual energy functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of weaving is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening through sensory and emotional density until the lamp’s rekindling crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the light returns, the haunting recedes, and safety is “bottled” not in glass but in persistent glow. Cost is legible in the enduring sorrow woven into the light itself. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality flows via patterned accumulation, not mechanical cause-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (light, shadow, prophecy) until the final image achieves Charged Poise: Kael’s laughter merging with the storm signals a reconfiguration of destruction as creation. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3 (“Kael, the laughing storm herald, climbed the spiral stairs…”). However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates atmospherically but never narrows Kael’s options or forces a trade-off; the storm arrives, he performs his routine, and visions intensify, but no live path is foreclosed. Cost is implied (“fraught with loss”) but never rendered visible or specific on the page, weakening the closure’s emotional purchase.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through iridescence, light, and heartbeat motifs until the climactic illumination refracts meaning onto the wall. Orientation is immediate and precise: Kaelen, floating tea house, post-transplant. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that story-magnetism requires embracing beauty and peril—charged by the donor heart’s legacy and the wing’s disintegration. Cost is legible: the wing’s destruction and the irreversible acceptance of a borrowed life now woven into narrative fate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through dream maps, moonlight, and tree-witness motifs until the pin-drop triggers a Conceptual Repricing: sorrow dissolves into “mundane miracles.” Closure is earned via Charged Poise—the final image of Elara touching the oak reconfigures the labyrinth as a “tapestry of interconnected stories,” with clear conceptual cost (abandoning isolation for connection). The pin’s echo functions as a taught pattern that pays off decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the woven dawns return, communities reunite, and Elara’s memories coalesce—all with felt cost (the brink of irreversible silence). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sensory layering (phosphorescent plants, humming air, thin notes growing), culminating in a cadence shift as voices join. The mica window flickers early and pays off decisively. One flaw: the “profound stillness” inciting incident lacks causal setup—it arrives as declared urgency rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts her past and redefines solitude as open-hearted rather than fearful, with visible emotional cost in her trembling voice and shadow-hiding. The causal chain—invitation → attendance → sharing → reading → realization—is coherent under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure). Orientation is solid by line 30; the drive lens holds. Minor deduction: the ritual’s mechanics feel convenient, lacking friction that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory detail, memory, and object layers meaning until the journal’s discovery crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing—absolution isn’t self-granted but inherited and renewed through care. Cost is legible in Elara’s realization that memory requires tending, not just mourning. The empty sky transforms from void to charged space of potential, satisfying Earned Stasis with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and fading light, culminating in Earned Stasis as Elian completes his task amid irreversible loss. Orientation is immediate and vivid (frozen library, quartz hush), with clear who/where/when by line 3. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the vows’ meaning endures not in magic but in record—with legible conceptual cost (silence, fading, cold). One meaningful deepening occurs as the queen’s vow offers hope, then dissolves, tightening the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail, recurring motifs, and rhythmic cadence that culminates in the fob capturing the “snap” of broken trust. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara walks away with the fob now imbued with meaning, foreclosing vengeance in favor of preservation, at the cost of innocence. The tide’s rise provides structural urgency, and the false-start tactic creates patterned pressure. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic resonance until the aurora flares and the forest hums—a Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible: Elara loses innocence (“nostalgia for simpler times”) and gains burdened wisdom. Orientation is clear by line 3; the electoral timeframe tightens stakes without confusion. The ring’s stillness and her softened glow mark a decisive reconfiguration of self and world.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara achieves Earned Stasis by renouncing perfectionism and embracing flawed creation, with visible cost in her tears and lingering sorrow. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (crystals, charcoal, memory) until the cadence shift at sketching crystallizes her stance. The broken lock’s combination unlocking memory is a motivated ellipsis that reweights her entire artistic identity. Every beat tightens around the dominant stake: uncorking creativity despite shame.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (leaves, zinc plates, candor) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: lost conversations are stored, not gone. Cost is legible—the toxic sky, scarcity, the wilted leaves—and the archive’s activation reweights the premise with emotional and social weight. Orientation is clear by line 3; the map’s discovery and journey cohere causally within the textural design. Closure lands decisively with Charged Poise: Aria now inscribes truth forever.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs until the climactic symphony triggers a Conceptual Repricing: wonder is restored not by magic but by harmonious action. The closure lands decisively—the color blooms, tears fall, the iceberg glistens brighter—and carries conceptual cost: truth requires silent, diligent care. Orientation is clear by line 30; the drive lens holds coherently from first bell to final chime.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael escapes, foreclosing his caretaker role with visible cost (carrying fears). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via magnetic shifts, flickering systems, and organic imagery culminating in the burn. Cost is legible in “condensed essence of all those fears within his core.” Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality flows via magnetic instability enabling the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a causal lens: the locket’s discovery leads to inquiry, which builds toward the mailbox’s opening. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration—Mr. Hemlock’s emotional release and renewed connection—but the cost is implied rather than shown (e.g., no visible sacrifice or irreversible loss). The orientation is strong from the outset, though the transition from courtyard to apartment lacks spatial clarity. The locked mailbox payoff lands, yet the locket’s key feels conveniently coincidental rather than causally prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: Elara’s dance-decoding builds density until the final hum awakens the lab. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she achieves liberation and inner peace—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible sacrifice or irreversible loss is shown. The hangman’s dice landing on “release” leans toward symbolic convenience rather than earned causality. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern pays off cohesively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “deleted memories don’t go anywhere; they simply are,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through gravity fluctuations, coffee grounds, salt crystals—and culminates in a resonant final image (lantern flame as “tiny, steady gravity”). Causality holds: whale’s beaching stirs forces → coffee map → chamber → exhumation → memory return. Cost is legible in Elara’s physical struggle and the weight of recovered grief.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure never intensifies beyond atmospheric repetition. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (prophecy silenced), yet cost is abstract (“balance restored”) with no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path. Orientation is clear early, but the ritual unfolds without complication or stakes-tested choice. The prophecy’s threat remains declarative, never dramatized as active danger.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Structure is taut and accumulative, anchored immediately in a specific time (Leonid meteor shower), place (rooftop garden), and character dynamic. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring motifs (seal, jasmine, meteors), and ritualized tea sessions until the climax reweights everything via Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that architecture speaks only between living and dead. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the mentor vanishes, leaving the protagonist alone with silent responsibility. The seal’s transfer crystallizes Charged Poise, making before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and lyrical repetition build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure is achieved—the archived memory becomes history, not chain—with felt cost in the loss of her mother’s presence. However, the causal link between “resonance structures” and emotional resolution lacks dramatized mechanics; the archive happens via assertion, not because/therefore causality. The orientation is strong from the first line.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (thorn, aurora, stalactites) until the final act reweights meaning with clear cost: Elara’s blood, her relinquished burden. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses her identity as prisoner of past deeds—and the cost is legible in her lighter heart and abandoned thorn. Orientation is immediate and stable; no disorientation penalty applies. The drip rhythm and twilight shifts serve as taught pattern elements that pay off in the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered echoes, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—truth echoes authentically, falsehoods dissolve. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Kaelen’s song restores order, and his own echo becomes part of the eternal melody, with felt cost (“melancholy lingered”). Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. However, escalation relies on revelation rather than tightening pressure—knowledge deepens, but options don’t meaningfully narrow until the climax, slightly softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias’s spirit calms, Kaelen departs with peace forged, and the shrine retains echoes—a before/after legible through the snow globe’s transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream fragments accumulate into emotional truth, culminating in a cadence shift (“He walked into the night…”). Cost is felt in Anya’s tears and Kaelen’s solitude. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; pattern of dream shards taught early and pays off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: moon paths, fireflies, and nets layer into a resonant tapestry, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—the realization that appreciation itself is a form of repair. Closure lands with quiet authority, though the “felt cost” is oblique; the price of this insight is implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single scene holds coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen holds the diamond, the storm stills, and he faces an irreversible choice with clear conceptual cost—the world was murdered to bury this secret. The drive lens is Causal: each discovery (letters, numbers, tree rings) logically leads to the next, culminating in activation of the stillpoint. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3 (“wasteland orchard… radioactive dust… liquidation”). The cost is legible in the flickering sanctuary and encroaching winds.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring motifs (cobalt glass, radio static), and cadence shifts culminating in Charged Poise at dawn. Closure is valid—Elara’s quiet presence amid reconciliation reconfigures her role with felt cost (loss of sanctuary, ambiguous belonging). However, the descent and council scenes blur causality; key turns (e.g., interpreting the song) lack clear “because/therefore” links under even a hybrid lens. The cobalt canopy homage lands resonantly but doesn’t foreclose a path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he accepts his role as keeper, foreclosing his past identity with visible cost—the weight of jars replaces fame. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density builds via repeated jar-captures, culminating in the semicircle choir. Cost is legible in “hands trembled… not from fatigue, but from the weight of his quest.” Orientation is anchored by line 2 (“feral loft beneath the dunes”), and the pattern pays off in the final image of the empty loft as a “library of captured moments.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in Earned Stasis (Kaelen’s successful tuning). Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the marina’s chaos yields to order, and Kaelen reaffirms his purpose—but cost remains abstract; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is shown. Orientation is strong early, though the causal link between vibrational matching and sonic absolution lacks mechanical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—with clear conceptual cost: the abandonment of generational haste for intentional slowness, crystallized in the collective unyoking. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with lunar tracking, rain-charged viaduct, and frozen lake layering into a cadence that reweights time itself. Orientation is immediate (“basalt sanctuary beside the frozen lake”), and the convergence of moons provides a precise, earned trigger. The final image—Elara at peace, horizon awaiting “with all the time in the world”—makes the before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: drought → rushed repairs → death → cover-up → discovery → confrontation → escape. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s “No” crystallizes her break from submission, with visible cost (risk of retaliation) and irreversible change. Orientation is anchored immediately; the single scene in the tunnel maintains spatial coherence. The ledger discovery and Thorn’s arrival escalate pressure credibly, though the hidden compartment verges on contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the chaplain’s renewed advocacy is foreclosed from his prior inertia, with tangible cost in time, humility, and effort. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (light, silence, gears) until the final chime reweights regret into action. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality flows through tactile cause/effect (jam → patience → repair). Cost is legible in the “deliberate care” that replaces spiritual performativity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (kaleidoscope patterns, acid sea hiss, grinding gears) until the chime reweights everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the bell’s unheard peal seeds future change, with cost legible in the algorithm’s silence and Elara’s solitude. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (“Elara… soared above the churning acid sea”). The final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution, fulfilling Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pattern intensification (recurring numbers, patch detail) reweighting stakes toward conceptual cost. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: deleted files “go into the silence between the notes,” a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable social cost (truth erased to protect reputations). The lie enables access, the patch decodes the frequency, and the scrubbed logs confirm sabotage—all causally linked. Cost is legible in the final image: Elara’s permanent absorption of absence, foreclosing justice but preserving memory.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because the orb shattered, the ice destabilizes; therefore Kaelen seeks mirrors to restore it; thus he frees the leviathan. Closure is a Decisive Change—the orb is whole, the anomaly resolved—with conceptual cost (his past failure acknowledged, peace restored through empathy). Orientation is immediate (“lighthouse orchard,” “Kaelen”), and the two-shard structure (orchard → vintage store → return) is cleanly executed. The only flaw: the leviathan’s introduction at climax borders on retroactive, though its pain thematically aligns with the orb’s fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (parasol tip, trawling, wind) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: endings have a sound, and that sound no longer frightens her. Cost is legible—the abandonment of death as escape—but the “waking changed” inciting incident remains unexplained, functioning more as premise than causal pivot. Orientation is clear by line 3, and closure lands with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with autumnal decay and recurring vine imagery deepening thematic resonance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: mismatches are revalued as necessary contrasts. However, cost remains oblique—the “compost into wisdom” metaphor lacks concrete, felt sacrifice on the page. The bus departure frames time but doesn’t tighten decisions; the ending offers poise without foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers thicken into a sustained field, culminating in living truths. Orientation anchors early (pavilion, dunes, Kael), and closure lands as Earned Stasis—Kael’s stewardship forecloses personal resolution for generational duty, with cost implied in his perpetual watch. However, the kinetic parapet’s emergence feels coincidental rather than causally tied to Kael’s actions, weakening pressure escalation. The final image reconfigures echo from fading memory to living force, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: photographs, vines, and memories layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure, with the exhibition crystallizing communal healing. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“lavender field tucked behind rusted factory ruins…”). The cost—suppressed grief transformed into shared solidarity—is legible in Mr. Hemlock’s tears and the empty map case. However, escalation relies on additive accumulation without a decisive narrowing of options; the “tightening” is thematic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered auditory imagery and symbolic resonance until the climax coalesces into a heartbeat-like rhythm. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: language is redefined as dormant, not dead, with the cost being Elara’s lifelong isolation now transformed into purposeful testimony. The “suspended hush” deepening at dawn serves as a Charged Poise moment where stakes crystallize. All elements converge cleanly, though the transition from decoding to public address is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (fog, echoes, chalk, driftwood) until the climax crystallizes into Conceptual Repricing: capturing time’s sound requires surrender, not inscription. The closure is earned—chalk snaps, memory dissolves, and acceptance emerges—with clear conceptual cost (the impossibility of permanence). Orientation is immediate (“junkyard prophet stood in the fog sculpture garden”), and disorientation serves thematic payoff. One tightening suffices: the worn chalk stub becomes the final, failing tool.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara halts the spinning clock hand, arresting chaos to preserve a fleeting cosmic event, with clear conceptual cost—the permanence of the flare comes at the price of enduring emotional ache. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: patterned repetition (“by the sound of a leaf falling,” “luminous ache”) builds density until the cadence shift at the flare’s capture reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“Elara… lunar observatory suspended above the clouds”), and the causal chain between tremor, flare timing, and camera adjustment remains coherent. The persistent constraint—the clock’s spin—shapes tactics and crystallizes in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Alistair achieves peace through Elara’s intervention, foreclosing regret with visible cost (his frailty, years of silence). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds through sensory density (breath, tea steam, vinyl) until the Mahler recording crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: the broken vinyl remains, a testament to wholeness in fragments. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure: noon shadows no longer vanish because Elara rebinds reality through rune work, reweighting the world’s rules with tangible cost (the broken key, deeper awakenings stirring). Causality is tight—key insertion triggers automaton, which guides alignment, which reveals shadow paths, which informs ritual. The drive lens is Causal, held consistently, and the ending crystallizes stakes without over-explaining. Cost is legible in the cracked key and Elara’s resolve amid looming danger.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights reality itself through ritual, transforming deception into a bridge between worlds. The cleft-to-constellation arc is earned via on-page causality—each micro-choice (gathering herbs, kneeling, whispering) tightens pressure toward this reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the burial of the substitute body and dissolution of the tooth, marking irreversible loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cohesively, with sensory density escalating to the firefly constellation payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara crystallizes her stance—to carry reflected light into the world—with conceptual cost (abandoning protective solitude). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with patterned returns to memory, mist, and reflection that deepen meaning. A decisive intensification occurs when moonlight through the fissure activates the sea glass, reweighting her entire purpose. Cost is legible in the final image: “earthbound heart felt lighter,” implying prior burden.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where meaning accrues through sensory density and recurring motifs (icicle patterns, amber, moss). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara and Leo’s silent pact reweights the viral confession from rupture to pruning, with cost legible in their shared fatigue and the pendant’s transfer. The drip-pattern blueprint crystallizes options without grand gesture. Every image tightens around the central stake—reclaiming narrative from exposure—and the final beat (“stronger at the broken places”) delivers Conceptual Repricing with emotional and social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated cameos that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps out renewed, the nexus stilled. The closure is legible and carries conceptual cost—the end of the whisper implies finality—but the “whisper of closing pages” as temporal pressure lacks concrete on-page mechanics that alter tactics. Orientation is clear early; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: golden stories layer meaning until alignment arrives. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis via restored balance, with the vine curling around Elara’s wrist as a charged final image implying ongoing duty. Cost is felt conceptually (the land’s decay reversed through personal labor) but not viscerally; no tangible sacrifice limits future action. The structure is coherent, though escalation relies on lyrical intensification rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard transforms from decay to site of meaning, and Elara’s map pulses as a beacon. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via ritual repetitions, culminating in a cadence shift when the breeze sighs. Cost is legible: bodily endurance against cold, time spent, and emotional labor crystallized in the plate. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through rhythmic observation of echoes across dawn, noon, and dusk, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: “echoes are not just sounds, but memories of space itself.” Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the wounded season heals, but its essence is preserved only because Elian acted. The marble cavern’s transformation from passive setting to active collaborator reinforces the reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated fractal-weaving beats that deepen thematic weight rather than causal progression. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s expanded boundaries reframe her infinite task not as entrapment but wisdom-gathering, with conceptual cost in the extinguished lamp and physical burden now lifted. The pattern is taught early (“shingled hush,” “orient properly”) and pays off cohesively; starlight and snowmelt anchor time and place by line 3, avoiding orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she contains grief without resolving it, foreclosing catharsis but gaining poise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in the lion carving as crystallized time. Cost is legible: emotional labor replaces tears, and the whistle’s intrusion underscores time’s irreversibility. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through layered fragments until the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—lands with palpable cost: Elara surrenders her futile pursuit, symbolized by abandoning the camera wheel. Disorientation is taught early (“chronologically confused mind”) and pays off when time reconfigures as a river, resolving the opening ambiguity. The kinetic lagoon’s calming and parting clouds provide on-page evidence of change. Cost is legible in the surrendered object and transformed ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (maze of intentions, redirected flows) until the final image reweights decay as renewal. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal shifts from monument of failure to sanctuary of resilience, with tangible cost in Kaelen’s labor and the irreversible departure of the carnival. The sextant’s placement on a pedestal crystallizes Charged Poise—options are legible, stakes clear. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal”), and the pattern is taught by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with petrichor, crystal whispers, and ticking coalescing into a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of transformed artistry. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses her symphonic dream but gains peace, with clear conceptual cost (silenced music internalized as clockwork rhythm). Orientation is immediate (“introverted clock scribe,” “soundless sanctuary”), and the single-scene structure tightens around rain-washed clarity. The final tick-and-whisper duet crystallizes Charged Poise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs until the conceptual repricing at closure: the bell was never real—the truth was the betrayal. The Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 3. The final image delivers a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: Elara abandons salvage for understanding. Every beat tightens around the central lie, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration that feels inevitable yet freshly revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s role transforms, the weavers vanish, and she steps into the world with new purpose—all with conceptual cost (the burden of legacy). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: fog, knots, glass, and silence build density until the fulgurite pulses and the weavers manifest. Orientation is clear by line 3. One tightening occurs—the decoding—and it directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (thread, carpet, leaves) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: absences are redefined as “spaces where love once lived.” Cost is legible in Elara’s “fractured soul” and Kael’s unspoken grief, crystallized in the Charged Poise of the final bench moment. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure serves the lyric escalation without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (egg, stalactites, quaking) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: beauty is dormant, not dead. Orientation is immediate (“bedraggled prince,” “suspended palace”), and the closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the ghostly bird’s ephemeral song. The mechanical world’s pause and the prince’s tears render the conceptual cost undeniable. Every beat tightens around the central stake without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces fire’s legacy by grafting kindness onto wounds, with visible cost in emotional labor and memory. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory layering and symbolic resonance rather than causal turns—and holds coherently. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. The final image reconfigures scars from shame to song, with conceptual cost legible in the coin’s dual symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s silence breaks into flowing memory-water, reconfiguring Elara’s stance from liberator to witness. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—each glass shard deepens luminosity and pressure until alignment triggers release. Cost is legible in Elara’s “sidereal patience” and the geese’s temporal window. The box’s mechanics are consistent, and the final image crystallizes before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s end becomes a legacy through sonic transmission, reweighting “sharing light” from preservation to dissemination. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sonar echoes, petal falls, and gear calculations until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the “quiet sigh of falling petals” marking irreversible loss. Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation is never an issue.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: grief redefined as fluid, connective, and beautiful—a network like ribbons or butterfly paths. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring motifs (ribbons, monarchs, poems) that culminate in Elara’s recitation and the greenhouse’s cathedral-like resonance. Cost is legible in the grandfather’s dissolution and Elara’s acceptance of transformation over void. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through rhythmic returns to the pendulum’s pause, each deepening Elias’s reckoning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he endures his guilt until it transmutes into peace, with cost legible in “the weight of his task heavy upon him” and the final “weight of the world lifted.” The tidal ridge and rake handle anchor cause without contrivance. Minor deduction: the grandfather’s inscriptions feel slightly deus ex machina, though their prior use mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density builds through recurring motifs (velveteen gloom, sovereign case, frayed threads) until the final map crystallizes meaning. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry’s decoded border reweights the cemetery from static ground to living archive, with clear cost—the vanished gardener’s interrupted legacy now borne by Elara. Orientation is immediate (“cemetery gardener,” “chess clock,” “cobalt silo”), and the single-scene shard fits scope. The snapped thread revealing the journal is a motivated ellipsis that deepens pressure without violating causality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered imagery and recursive motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the frozen lake cracks not by force but by narrative contagion. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—the future is no longer blank but a “living map”—with conceptual cost in the surrender of authorial certainty. Orientation is immediate and sustained; the obsidian spire, frozen lake, and quill anchor who, where, and when by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (dust, glow, mist) until the final image reweights everything: dust glowing with secret luminosity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—narratives flourish within the alcove while the famine persists outside, with clear conceptual cost (isolation, risk). Orientation is solid by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern pays off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirage of safety dissolves into acceptance, charged by Elara’s act of grinding the mask. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through recurring images (chair, ash, porcelain) until the final powdering reweights meaning. Cost is legible in her solitude and the irreversible destruction of the mask. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density through layered sediment, competing narratives, and the recurring cog. Closure arrives via Charged Poise: Elara’s resolve hardens as she uncovers tidal equations, reconfiguring her purpose without overt action—but with felt conceptual cost (isolation, burden). Orientation is solid by line 30, and the single scene holds focus. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the “deepening” is cognitive, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis through collective vocal harmony that reconfigures past discord into present unity, with conceptual cost (the ongoing labor of unlearning). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory motifs (dust motes, velvet, woodsmoke) until the rosette crystallizes meaning. Autumn’s cyclical time and library’s stillness frame a before/after legible in the final chord. One flaw: the rosette’s discovery leans slightly coincidental, though its symbolic payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: celestial alignment intensifies sensory density, culminating in the seed’s sprouting as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the closure’s cost—“old sorrows” released—is abstract, not concretely legible on the page. Orientation is solid early, but escalation relies on atmospheric buildup rather than narrowing options or deepening stakes through causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the blackout’s end reframes routine as a vessel for wonder, with visible cost in exhaustion, urgency, and emotional fragility. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (failure → riddle → interpretation → action → reboot). The lacquer box’s emptying and re-closing crystallize a before/after state. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“city-wide blackout,” “lightning collection tower,” “Elara”), satisfying early anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “aliveness” as the result of intentional displacement, not inherent spirit. The cost is conceptual—the acceptance that vitality must be actively maintained—and legible in the cottage’s sigh and warming walls. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring motifs (streetlights, hush, displacement) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the statue redefines guardianship as flexible curation rather than static sentinel duty, with visible cost in relinquishing absolute certainty. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—revelations build like waves, each deepening the last—and the final image (empty ampoule among sea-flower roots) crystallizes this shift. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten underwater city garden”), and causality remains intact via telepathic discovery → action → consequence. Cost is legible: the statue surrenders its foundational truth for relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “perpetual motion” from endless ascent to courageous movement within limits. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of the quest to “capture” the past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via dice rolls, equations, and sensory detail until the rupture reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate (“infinite staircase”), and the crack’s manifestation pays off early disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mosaic of kindness-vignettes that coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing: lost languages live on through empathy. Orientation is immediate (“Elara, an insomniac painter… rooftop greenhouse”), and the closure—a global network of remembered kindnesses—is resonant and charged with conceptual cost (erasure vs. persistence). Each shard is legible, pattern-taught by ~25%, and the waxing moon’s intensifying glow provides cadence shift. No causality breaks; the drive lens holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered sensory and cultural decay until the breakthrough reweights everything. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of baking “E”-shaped bread crystallizes communal renewal, with the cost of prior loss (beekeeper’s absence, failed loaves) felt in the warmth’s contrast to earlier dread. The ledger, lens, and honey form a causal chain that tightens meaningfully, and the ending image makes the before/after legible without exposition. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of memory-as-material is taught early and paid off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara doesn’t escape fate but fractures its logic, leaving the world unmoored—a decisive reweighting of the story’s premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through escalating radiance, reversed clocks, and environmental inversion (rain falling upward). Cost is legible in the “hollow freedom” and loss of all anchors. Every beat tightens toward this charged poise without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara endures and confronts fear, foreclosing its parasitic hold with visible cost—the loss of the clasp, the advisor’s departure, and the acceptance of inner emptiness as strength. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (enter funhouse → follow luminance → consult dictionary → confront shadow). Cost is legible in the final image: “steady, inner light” replaces external crutches. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wave threat is harmonized, not defeated, and the orchard’s song grows richer, foreclosing any return to passive silence. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered sound until the wave climax reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the “restless euphony” that continues, implying perpetual vigilance. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality flows through fractal logic consistent with the world.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gate remains shut, but the city’s relationship to isolation transforms through recognition of its own stagnation. Cost is legible in the “crack that had let the light in”—a physical and spiritual rupture now sealed, yet irrevocably altered. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with pattern language as the causal engine. Every beat tightens around the flaw in resonance, culminating in a Charged Poise where silence becomes dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the truth’s release reweights the scribe’s legacy with historical justice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the ivy, rose, letter, and parallels layer into a resonant final image. Cost is legible in the thorn-sharp reminder that truth is painful. The petal-drop clock tightens urgency cleanly, and the discovery feels earned through patterned attention.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered absences until the final note reweights everything. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias accepts his role as keeper of lost dreams, foreclosing his own quiet life—a cost made legible when he seals his confession underwater. Orientation is immediate (“drawbridge groaned shut… Elias stood firm”), and the single-scene structure tightens pressure without redundancy. The inkwell’s recurrence and submerged setting cohere into a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through tactile repetition and patterned revelation. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the codex’s plural origins reweight the city’s foundational myth, with cost felt in Elara’s relinquished certainty. The blackout functions as both setting and pressure, not coincidence, and the hidden drawer payoff is foreshadowed by wood warping. Every beat advances knowledge or stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara’s grief is transformed, her shadow restored, with felt cost embedded in the luminous cranes. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density of sensory detail, recurring motifs, and cadence shifts reweight sorrow into hope. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality remains intact via ritual logic. Final image (“fleet of luminous cranes”) makes conceptual and emotional cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through resonant images until the blackout triggers a Conceptual Repricing: love as quantum foam, not lost potential. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality holds via perturbation theory’s feedback loop. Closure lands with devastating clarity—Kaelen’s stance reconfigures without physical action, yet the cost (abandoning the hunt) is legible in his inert departure. The circuit-breaker clock tightens pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterned imagery (star trails, missing pieces, brilliant dimness) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the frequency of belonging reweights Kael’s relationship to self and cosmos. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality is maintained via drone use → data collection → lever pull → resonance. However, the pilgrim’s role borders on deus ex machina—her presence motivates the quest but she exerts no active pressure, and her reappearance feels ceremonial rather than consequential. Cost is felt emotionally (“felt whole”) but remains abstract, lacking tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces her trade with visible cost (carrying permanent regret), crystallized in the final image of returning to the terrace no longer as a prison but a place of reflection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (cobalt shadows, sieved hush, damp sand) until the withheld truth surfaces via the carved wood. Cost is legible in “heavier in heart” yet “lighter in spirit,” and the watch hand’s transformation from relic to soul-fragment charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s spirit untethers as she descends, the moon witnessing a fragile peace. Cost is legible—her past failure’s guilt lifted through earned dialogue and symbolic gesture. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: mist, wind, moon, and drawer pull accrue meaning without causal turns, deepening stakes through sensory density. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring motifs deepen pressure until the compass’s loss triggers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Orientation is clear by line 3, and the closure delivers a decisive internal realignment with felt cost—the abandonment of celestial navigation for earthly guides. However, the wave-induced kayak tip functions more as symbolic punctuation than causal escalation; the true turn is psychological, not physical, which slightly softens the pressure curve required for top-tier causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: bioluminescent ripples, newspaper decoding, and the baseball’s return build a resonant pattern culminating in Charged Poise—Leo’s acceptance of his past as inseparable from empathy. Cost is legible in his relinquished innocence and the irreversible integration of memory. The structure is coherent, though the “procedure” backstory remains under-anchored, slightly weakening causality at the inciting threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara permanently becomes a threshold guardian, foreclosing her human life with visible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent, memory, and ritual build density until the bridge forms—and holds coherently. The fortune cookie’s payoff reweights the opening promise with cosmic intimacy. One flaw: the phoenix’s rise functions more as backdrop than causal pressure, slightly weakening the “after” timeframe’s narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts she cannot recover lost time but can honor it. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring objects (saucer, tablecloth, ink-stained cards), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible: she abandons the quest for retrieval, choosing integration instead. Orientation anchors are clear by line 2 (“midnight glade above the clouds”).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: shimmering tear-trails accumulate into a tapestry, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where compassion—not force—opens the dimension. Closure lands with spiritual weightlessness as earned stasis, carrying the cost of leaving the ship behind. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“recycled spaceship,” “last steward”), and the final image reconfigures humanity’s sorrow into a homecoming. No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the luminous threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights poverty as metamorphosis, with visible cost (her last possessions released). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via celestial alignment, volcanic breath, and bug-light convergence. The detour initiates causality that culminates in accidental prophecy fulfillment. Cost is legible in the empty jars left behind—a resonant image of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    The blackout provides functional disorientation early, quickly anchored by Elara’s role and setting. The story follows a causal drive lens: blackout → opportunity → decoding → distribution → completion. Closure is a Charged Poise—revolution is inevitable, masters unaware—but the cost is implied rather than shown (e.g., no risk of capture, exhaustion, or moral toll). The pattern holds, though escalation lacks a true narrowing of options; everything proceeds smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Kaelen misplaces one rock, the vision shows failure; therefore he corrects it, enabling success. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the frictionless world isn’t fixed but harmonized—charged by the visible cost of years of cursed isolation now lifted. The aurora’s intensification acts as a coherent deadline, and the leadwood box/star dust mechanics pay off without retroactive patches. Orientation is clear by line 2 (who: Kaelen; where: tidal bluff; when: post-friction collapse), serving closure via the “borrowed dawn” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (storm, timer, scars) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—scars as constellations—reweighting trauma into art. Orientation is clear by line 3. Closure lands with conceptual cost (silence broken, past reclaimed). However, the stranger’s arrival lacks causal groundwork; it functions more as symbolic payoff than earned turn, slightly undermining causality under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the duel transforms from combat to collaboration, reweighting the premise with the cost of abandoned rivalry. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the brook, needles, sundial, and light build density until the scroll reveals the overture. Orientation is immediate (glass atrium, mechanical arm, waiting), and the single scene tightens coherently. The final image of stepping beside the brook crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via rhythmic repetition of rebuilding acts, culminating in Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where their sanctuary becomes legible as resistance. Cost is felt in Elara’s shedding self and the fragility of their work (“precarious tower,” “frayed edges”). The moon’s arc provides temporal structure without forcing causality. Closure lands with conceptual weight: beauty arises *because of* anarchy, not despite it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian forecloses passive despair by stepping into the film and composing an unplanned encore, crystallizing agency at immense temporal cost. Orientation anchors instantly (“wistful station pianist,” “tidal arbor above the clouds”). Causal lens holds: each action (projector setup, chord sequence) directly enables the next under pressure. Cost is legible in the final image—the clock showing new time, compasses darkened—proving fate was surprised.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure fails the required test: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost appears on the page. Elara’s success is declared (“cultural memory was now secure”), yet nothing is lost, foreclosed, or reconfigured—memory is merely relocated into fruits. The monsoon arrives and departs without consequence; the ridge “blooms again,” negating stakes. This absence of felt or conceptual cost invalidates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of lace, tide, color, and breath deepen until the locket reveal crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (islet, rain-ceased, two characters), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kaelen’s regret transforms into acceptance without erasure. Cost is legible in the “gentle ache” replacing sharp pain and the unspoken words now acknowledged internally. The compass doesn’t solve but reveals; causality remains intact within its lyric logic.
