  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well, building from damaged greenhouse to butterfly wing to final understanding that "change...was simply continuous." Cost is legible in the decay patterns and lost species. However, the ending truncates mid-sentence ("her"), preventing full closure resolution and suggesting incomplete execution.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist discovers the full ledger through the turquoise shard and chooses remembrance over revenge, with emotional cost visible in her tears. The accumulative structure coheres as frost patterns, glass shards, and the mentor's teachings converge at the kiln. However, the abrupt ending mid-sentence ("She would carry the") undermines full closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the conservatory's thawing and the bird's stirring—a clear before/after with visible cost in Rowan's "empty" case and physical transformation. The accumulative structure builds coherently from frozen silence to color-chord to thaw. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "someone lookout on a windowless ship," which dilutes the otherwise concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from receiving the lens to restoring the lighthouse, with the underwater library serving as the transformative crucible. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias permanently changes his role from burying bodies to guiding souls home, with visible cost (bleeding fingers, his own name inscribed). Minor orientation wobble around "occupying impossible spaces" but recovers through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed packets transforming survival into future-planting, with visible cost in the sanctions context. The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual repetition. However, the unfinished final sentence creates ambiguity about whether full closure lands on-page, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the integration of past/present selves with visible cost (the cracked bowl, unused love transformed). The accumulative lens holds as image layers build toward transformation. Deduction for orientation delay (who/where/when takes ~120 words to clarify) and some causality softness around the mystical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes the texture she sought. Closure lands with clear cost—her dispersal into the garden's breath. The retrocognitive trap and hyperbolic geometry create consistent constraints that shape her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from decoding keys → finding vault → escaping → planting seeds, with a Decisive Change closure where she transforms from prisoner to active seed-planter. The cost is visible in "chains discarded among the sage" and her vulnerable position "ankle-deep in tiny mounds." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly within the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with the mosaic assembly accumulating toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist chooses witness over warning. The brother's memory provides the decisive reweighting that transforms understanding. Cost is visible in leaving the device behind and walking away with diminished synesthesia.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the jar filling with stolen moments until the decisive release creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—the thief reinterprets herself from one who steals beauty to one who can bear it. Cost is visible in the emptying of her "pockets heavy with stolen light" and the abandonment of her craft. The destiny door opening "wide enough to step through" charges the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara shifts from abandoning to staying, with visible cost in her acknowledgment that "the first safe zone would begin with her own willingness to stay." The accumulative structure coheres through the thawing metaphor that links room, heart, and season. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2. The lens holds consistently through layered images of melting, though the abrupt cutoff weakens the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves a Decisive Change as the protagonist refuses their imposed role and burns the contracts, with visible cost (years of exploitation). The causal chain from seashell to rooftop confrontation holds tightly. Minor orientation wobble with the inland ocean taste, but the who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through catalogued silences building to the star's extinction—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle completes her map as darkness falls. Cost is visible: "Darkness fell absolute" after she releases the last star, and the future traveler will "weep where the line thinned to nothing."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the loop mechanism creating density through repetition and variation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as J-9 integrates all versions of itself, with clear cost ("not absolved, but integrated"). The orientation anchors (robot janitor, frozen courtyard, twilight) establish cleanly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with the lens revelation serving as catalyst for reconciliation, and closure lands with visible cost ("twenty years" of deception acknowledged). However, the whispering crystal's sudden personification ("stone choosing to offer comment") introduces a fantastical element not established early enough, creating mild coherence friction. The orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the wisteria's bloom and the queen's acceptance crystallize a new understanding with clear cost—the broken device, the buried marble as price. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each marble story builds toward the transformation. Slight dock for the abrupt ending mid-sentence, though it functions as deliberate ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira accepts carrying her brother "sideways" rather than recovering him linearly, with felt emotional cost in "victory tasted like thawed frost." The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery (moth-whale songs, magnetic fields) builds toward causal action (lever pull, corridor entry). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the sideways time concept pays off the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when "the orchestra pit musician and the ghost now shared the same breath" after the flood recedes and the opera house transforms. The accumulative progression from examining water-warped pages through performing the code with her clarinet builds coherently. Cost appears in Mara's willingness to wade deeper, risk her instrument, and ultimately merge identities with the vanished prima donna.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through repeated imagery (gentian, glacier, weight, margins) toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters confess their silences and the station "filled with the scent of wet earth." The 4.7 grams measurement literalizes abstract guilt effectively. Orientation anchors clearly (mountain weather station, oracle arriving, Elias the meteorologist), though the piece occasionally drifts into abstract territory that slightly dulls causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara's understanding that "the weight of a swallowed truth is not fixed; it shifts, ghostlike" transforms her relationship to both Jonah's confession and her own skepticism. The cost manifests in her release of epistemological certainty. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through layered measurements (137 grams, 21 grams) toward this conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper accepts his own dissolution into the regenerative silence. Cost is visible in "crumbling in place" and "fragrant with histories losing their grip," though the conceptual weight could be sharper. The origami swan constrains his journey method throughout. Orientation anchors (keeper, library, catacombs) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres through musical and natural imagery building toward Rowan's first words and Lila's gift of the curl—a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost (surrendering her daughter's keepsake). The eclipse frames the transformation effectively, though the final incomplete sentence weakens closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through diary discoveries to the revelation that walls return rather than keep stories, with Elara's transformation to courier as the Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible in her empty-handedness and release of her collecting compulsion. The pattern of reading, discovering, and returning creates clear escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the lighthouse transforms from spy post to public broadcast station, with visible cost (exposure of secrets, system disruption). The hybrid lens holds - causal discovery leads to accumulative broadcast effect. Who/where/when anchored early. Deduction for incomplete final sentence and slight mechanical feel in the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-taught layering of silence that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the demon dissolves into text, reinforcing the anchor's lattice—clear cost in the priest's transferred shimmer and empty palette. The orientation anchors early (dimensional anchor, priest, demon threat) and the closure lands with visible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with memories accumulating on the shell's spiral until critical mass triggers the lake's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when adult and child selves merge through the shell's transfer, with exhaustion as the explicit cost. The mirrored horizon concept anchors orientation early and pays off when she steps through it.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change as protagonist destroys the tablet to break the retracing loop, with visible cost in surrendering her gravity-defying power ("feet settle on the floor, gravity claiming her at last"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as procedural generation intensifies through architectural morphing until the algorithm fails, forcing the choice. Orientation anchors solidly by line 2 with character, setting, and situation clear.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ritual steps toward Mara's restoration of feeling. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she feels "the last shard of numbness dissolved" and teaches children through vibration. Cost is visible in her permanent deafness traded for renewed tactile connection.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (brass tube, quarantine zone, stone cherubs) culminating in Liora's decision to share dangerous knowledge through "delayed disclosure." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she transforms from solitary recorder to one who enables "lateral migration of truth," with cost visible in releasing her precious tube. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the pattern of lateral movement pays off. Minor causality wobble: the follower's exact motivation remains too vague.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elian releases the perfume, transforming from seller to planter of remembrance gardens. Cost is visible in his tears and the emptying of his livelihood. Accumulative structure coheres well though the final incomplete sentence weakens impact slightly. Who/where/when anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when the poet reties the knots, creating "a new pattern that honored both escape and surrender." The cost manifests in his transformation from drifting observer to active participant who "now carried the grotto inside him." The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered layer (clay, hair, wind) builds toward this reconfiguration of the rope from relic to bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the violinist transforms from performer to listener/conductor, with visible cost in the abandoned violin and gained purpose in nurturing the greenhouse's emergence. The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern intensification (drip→waltz, hush→student), though the middle section's pacing occasionally slackens between key transformative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory detail and emotional density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vale loses "the privilege of distance." The cost is felt through the dissolution of her counterfeit skins and the raw ache that replaces detachment. Minor orientation wobble with the buyer's gender shift (silhouette to woman) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around cycles of kindness, but closure lacks decisive cost on the page - the story ends mid-sentence without completing its final beat. The mistaken letter creates a meaningful turn that expands Marisol's mission. Orientation is clear early, but the incomplete ending prevents full closure validation despite the locket's return attempting resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through collaborative additions to the arbor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms into kinship. Cost is visible in tears and the years-later echo. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Deduction for slight causality softness in how others arrive at precisely the right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the captured echo transforms into portable knowledge, fundamentally changing Lira's relationship to the city. The cost is legible: she steals a second from the giant's sleep and witnesses potential futures including the empty city after the giant wakes. Orientation anchors (rooftop, canal, moonlight) establish immediately, and the magical system teaches its rules through action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Lira transforms from seeking to reverse loss's equation to understanding it as "a corridor rather than a wall," with the cost visible in her acceptance of permanent separation. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (eyes, parentheses, mathematics) that reweights at closure when she keeps "the parentheses open."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory detail and memory fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira realizes "visibility travels in both directions." The closure lands with emotional cost as she experiences the girl's tears as her own. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis shifting to acceptance, with visible cost in "the courage to keep growing." The accumulative lens holds as density increases from controlled observation to full immersion in storm, with the translucent leaf as compass marking the reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from tidal exposure through amber discovery to the exchange that delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Ishka trades physical amber for painted tomorrow, finally closing her sleepless eyes. Cost is visible in the "amber heat left her skin reluctantly" and the beetle's satisfied rest, though the conceptual weight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the clairvoyant's gift transforms from burden to wonder, with visible cost in his tears and admission of limitation. The accumulative structure coheres through the pearl's transformation (white→black→crystal) and the cave's metamorphosis. Slight deduction for the middle section's abstract handling of "unseen forces" as "ordinary choices stacked like sediment" which momentarily breaks the mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern-teaching of "staggered intervals" and fragment compilation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's silence calls returning sails. The closure lands with visible cost through "her hand trembled" and the transformation of footprints into "notes on a staff." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres through railway/mapping metaphors building to Elara's discovery and transformation. The closure lands with emotional cost as she internalizes her mother's truth, creating arrows pointing "inward." Orientation anchors establish by ~120 words though the metaphorical landscape occasionally obscures concrete causality. The resonant reconfiguration qualifies as valid closure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara transforms from skeptic seeking escape to active witness who promises return. The tile's patterns revealing her mother's death date provides concrete cost ("tears blurred the page"). Who/where/when anchored early, accumulative structure coheres through memory layers building to personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the magnetic manipulation sequence leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Veyra encounters all her goodbyes and gains new understanding. The closure lands with emotional cost ("no longer bored, her eternity now threaded with the quiet thunder of every farewell"). Who/where/when anchored early through "prismatic escondite" and immortal status.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered imagery (formaldehyde/lilies, ink as guilt, death/life duets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila accepts that "fairness was not a number but a process." The closure lands with felt cost as she walks in "borrowed shoes" of false condolences, though the moral calculus could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liang's understanding shifts from merely collecting to actively preserving light against silence, with the notepad becoming "luminous with the restraint of everything he had chosen not to forget." The accumulative structure coheres as texture-gathering builds toward this crystallized insight. Cost is felt through the abandoned shop, the dying lamp, and the weight of preservation against overwhelming silence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from death certificate paradox through fragment collection to final dissolution into "the space between stories" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (loss of identity). The poison label becoming a door and then a boat provides causal linkage within the textural design. Who/where/when anchored early ("ankle-deep in brine," "port," "03:17").

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts the paradox of "both busting and becoming" myths, with visible cost (bleeding fingers, mother's loss). The accumulative lens holds as resonant hums build toward the revelation about memory versus truth. The "gloomy cheerfulness" transforms from paradox to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise: Lila's raised stone chip and barker's promise crystallize the carnival's resistance at a moment of maximum pressure, with corporate buyers literally at the gates. The maze that returns buyers to their boats demonstrates earned resistance, though the abrupt ending truncates before we see the full cost of this defiance land.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchid's brief bloom and the capsule's violet flash create a charged moment of preservation against extinction. The closure lands with visible cost—the orchid will die, the grain vaporizes, but the photograph captures both. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the countdown structure provides clean causality through the chemical timer's calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Mara's return to waiting after successful repair, accepting the cyclical nature of her role. The accumulative lens holds consistently through water/light/sound patterns. Cost is visible in her acceptance of perpetual waiting, though the final beat could sharpen this price more acutely.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira finds the river's source without vanishing, reversing her predecessor's fate. The accumulative pattern of water imagery (condensation→lake→river) builds coherently under the textural lens with clear cost: she steps onto dangerous open water that "held her weight as if remembering."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where rhythm literally rebuilds the town through measured repetition and density increase. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the bell rings "of its own accord," showing the town's autonomous revival with clear cost (the boundary between living/dead blurs). The pattern teaches itself early through the tap-rest-tap rhythm and pays off when that rhythm becomes self-sustaining.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) lands with clear cost: Mara trades her most precious memory to survive, choosing "the second she let the perfume fall" as her one preservable moment. Causal lens holds: because the temple requires surrendering what one most wants to keep, therefore Mara must release her mother's memory to unlock the mechanism. The "gathered hush" functions as persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Leif transforms from "chasing hush" to "wearing it like armor," with clear cost in carrying his father's unheard truths. The accumulative structure coheres well through the lighthouse-labyrinth-return pattern. Slight opacity in the middle mirror sequence prevents higher scoring, though the ending crystallizes meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration—forgiveness dissolves both the bead and her binding, with visible cost in their eternal separation. The accumulative structure coheres through returning images (fruit, veil, bead) that reweight at the ending when dawn breaks the endless night. Causality holds under the textural lens as each visit builds toward this release, though the three-lifetime scope creates minor orientation friction early.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through nightly walks that culminate in Lira's Resonant Reconfiguration—understanding the labyrinth as loom and herself as shuttle. The closure lands with visible cost (fourteen nights of sleepwalking, the canyon sealing) and transforms her from seeker to weaver who "learned to keep both eyes open while dreaming." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the rebuilt sundial that transforms time from devourer to circle, with the protagonist's journey from exile to return mirroring this shift. The cost is legible in "bones and roots indistinguishable, growing something neither alive nor dead but finally, fully remembered"—a fusion that required seven days of labor among the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's completed ritual of slow correspondence, with cost visible in exposing her true self beneath pseudonyms. The accumulative structure coheres—chalk symbols accumulate meaning, surface mail philosophy deepens, and the final "winged envelope glowing" image reweights the opening's "memory of tomorrow." Who/where/when anchored early (Mara/arcade/dawn).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mira's completed chart will expose the conspiracy at dawn, with visible cost in her blood drops and the risk she takes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern and symbol building toward the final reweighting where "the future begin[s]." Orientation anchors (observatory, Mira, embroidery task) land early and the causal chain from candle's lean to chart placement is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as unsent letters dissolve and Lira speaks "I choose to stay present" to the boy's reflected face. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual progression, with visible cost in the blood-written apology and the dissolution of seven years' bitter weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lin planting the coral fragment, transforming it from dead relic to potential renewal. The accumulative structure coheres well with recurring water/tide imagery. Deduction for the somewhat diffuse cost—while emotionally felt through Lin's "unsaid apologies," the specific price of choosing this border hospital over "the sea" remains underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (cherub→light→painting→transformed orchard) with Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the painting continues glowing "a small defiance against forgetting" while fog gathers—visible cost in the impermanence. The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains coherent causality through the daydream fold mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lila abandons restoration for deliberate incompletion, with visible cost (leaving tools, accepting future pigmentation). The nested awakening structure coheres under the accumulative lens. The hobo nickel's transformation from found object to portal to embedded doorway tracks cleanly. Slight deduction for the abstract final line fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through gardens speaking "in unison, a fragrance of defiance" that transforms individual resistance into collective voice. Cost is visible in accepting "the spark might burn the hand that fed it oxygen." However, the abrupt ending mid-sentence ("grafting onto every") undermines full closure delivery, though the pattern of unified botanical rebellion lands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the poet's transformation from sleepless grief to luminous acceptance, with clear cost: "for the first time he felt the armistice settle inside his ribs like a seed." The accumulative structure coheres as each century adds density—postcard becomes vine becomes tree becomes chapbook—culminating in the shell becoming "a gargantuan lantern guiding lost lullabies home." The orientation anchors (poet, shell, centuries) establish early and the pattern teaches itself through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from routine care through crisis to resolution, with the repair of Liora's name creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that awakens the caretaker's own buried identity. The cost is felt in "some names are too heavy for a single throat" and the millennium of self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the archive transforms from tomb to conservatory, with visible cost in the shattered inkwell and emotional cost in breaking three months of silence. The accumulative build through promises → music → gathering → transformation holds coherently. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory details and ritual actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where water flows through "channels carved with respect rather than conquest." The closure lands with felt cost as Lira finally smiles after her mentor's death, having achieved harmony between opposing needs through precise calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora burns her false documents and releases the birds, with visible cost in "the ash rose in delicate spirals." The accumulative lens holds consistently through dust mote patterns, paper trails, and bird imagery. The return of the pigeons "one by one" crystallizes her acceptance of truth over fabrication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres well - from terrace observation through grain analysis to maze descent and reunion. The closure lands with emotional cost (three harvests of separation) and the weather code revelation reweights prior material. Minor orientation wobble in the opening but recovers; the "butterfly effect" causality could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the astrologer recognizes belonging as internal rather than external. The childhood memory revelation ("I will come home when the stars learn to swim") provides decisive reweighting of all prior imagery, and the cost is felt through her "second heart" and the city's lullaby as she departs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres as each seed reveals deeper truths about disappearing paths, building to the resonant reconfiguration that "missing pieces were not corridors or doorways but moments of pure feeling." Cost is visible in Lira's transformation from seeker to carrier of essence. The cyclical return structure supports the thematic closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise, where Finch's orchestrated performance crystallizes into multiple ripple effects (girl's discovery, sailors' charity, old man's memory) with clear before/after states. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as pattern builds through calculated randomness toward the violet halo image that reweights the entire performance. Cost is visible in the transformative effects on each observer, though Finch himself pays minimal personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lysandra transforms from tide dancer to cosmic scribe, with clear cost (permanent exile, bodily transformation). The accumulative structure coheres as each dance movement and rune inscription builds toward the final state where "Memory had found a loophole." However, the worldbuilding around the nostalgia ban could be more grounded in its practical implications.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery patterns (glass flaws, ripples, light refraction) build toward the transformation when "ordinary bubbles became planets." Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—Elowen sacrifices her collection to seed beauty in others. The "before everything shifted" frame creates purposeful tension, though the world-shift itself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from physical journey to ritual to transformation, with the moth dissolving into "forgive" as the decisive reconfiguration. Cost is legible in "the debt now a bridge" and the reframing of innocence as "lent" rather than lost, though the mechanism of pain-to-color translation edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through balloon launches toward the seed/tree transformation—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the gauge cracking open). The parallel timeline mechanism is taught early and pays off through recursive self-recognition. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "equations for hope" that occasionally dulls concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative structure coheres through layered discoveries building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts memory-keeping duty. Cost appears in "walls dream of what they once held; legacy's burden is to keep the dream alive, not to bury it." Who/where/when anchored early ("ivy-veiled passage behind the abandoned observatory"). Pattern of echo-mapping and diary fragments creates textural density leading to crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the borrowed heartbeat internalizes ("settling into a quieter, permanent rhythm inside her own chest"), fundamentally altering the protagonist's relationship to mortality and art. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds—from rain-slicked terrace to singing mirrors to blooming jasmine—each layer adding pressure toward the final transformation. Cost is visible in the "last syncopation" and the permanence of change.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and Kelis's forgiveness gesture, with visible cost in the absorbed objects and "names she could no longer carry." The accumulative structure coheres as each ritual element builds toward transformation. Slight softness in the cost's specificity—we feel the weight but don't know the precise names or failures being released.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure builds through layered revelations about the drought, the egg, and the salt patterns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira allows the river's return. The cost is explicit: she loses her water empire but gains "fractured grace." The textural lens holds consistently through imagery of cracks, fractures, and dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lys absorbs the prism containing silenced voices. The cost is clear: she carries their weight in her bones, becomes a living repository. The lens holds consistently through sensory accumulation and pattern-building. Minor orientation wobble with "empire's lullaby" concept arriving late without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through puppet vignettes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the audience transforms from passive observers to active story-creators, with visible cost in Lucien's confession about his propaganda past. The final unfinished line "typed code that projected the entire performance onto the dome" suggests amplification but needs completion for full closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration - the moth wing catching starlight "like a blush on the cheek of the world" reweights all prior gestures of remembrance. Cost is legible in Lira's acceptance of her own erasure ("the grotto had accepted her offering and begun its slow forgetting"). The piece teaches its pattern of temporary monuments early and pays it off through the tower's gradual dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, with density increase and pattern accumulation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where names are restored through sound rather than metal. The closure lands with visible cost—the caster must confront what she destroyed. Orientation anchors clearly (caster, sanctum, post-war). The rope's transformation from witness to voice carrier provides the decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Foresight transcends her programming to become the walker, with clear cost (dissolution of identity). The accumulative pattern of dream interpretation building to self-discovery holds consistently. The "Path and walker are one" crystallization reweights the entire narrative effectively, though the middle section's dream sequences could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands powerfully as a Decisive Change with clear cost - Naram-Sin permanently sacrifices his ability to count the stars' turns to ensure they continue turning. The causal chain from tile discovery through pattern decoding to covenant signing is impeccable. The final image of him walking away with only his "now useless" quartz lens while the constellation burns steady perfectly encapsulates the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira becomes part of the sanctuary's "velvet lungs," her death transforming into continuation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reality shifts layer with the sanctuary's evolving purpose. Cost is visible in her aging within the hush and final breath becoming a stored note. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to anchor the museum theft.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through breathing rhythms and glass mountain imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mirror maker transforms from captor to welcomer of dreams. The cost is legible in "the crack she hadn't noticed growing across her own heart" and the complete reformation of her workshop practice. Minor orientation wobble with "ruined orchard district" vs later "living grove" transformation slightly dulls causality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to Resonant Reconfiguration where binding wrists transforms the breach into "sweet rot that feeds next year's bloom." The orientation anchors (cathedral, mender, daughter's departure) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost is visible in the traded eye and the acceptance of imperfect healing rather than erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara becomes the orchard's guardian with visible cost (memories peeling away, life rewritten as footnote). The nonlinear structure teaches its pattern early through the mirror portal and "-47" door, paying off in the cyclical revelation that all curators are versions of herself. Orientation anchors (curator, asteroid orchard, pursuing forbidden knowledge) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library transforms into a living garden, with Elara's sacrifice (staying to tend it) as visible cost. The hybrid lens holds consistently through accumulative botanical imagery and causal negotiation beats. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some abstract middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (carnival ship, garden of names, narrative threads). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist floats away, threading letters into a new name "that held both of us without splitting." However, orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.3 applied).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through braids, sigils, and temporal mechanics that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the recovery of hidden history that reweights the university's reality. The door appearing/disappearing and rope-braiding mechanics create coherent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mapkeeper transforms her understanding of silence, with visible cost in her tears and the surrender of her hoarded quiet. The orientation anchors (harmonic caves, mapkeeper, post-arrival timeframe) establish clearly within the first paragraph. The unfinished final sentence prevents full closure, though the pattern teaches incompleteness as part of the design.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where rekindling the beacon transforms isolation into connection ("other lights flickered awake"). The accumulative lens holds as coincidences cohere into meaning, with visible cost in naming losses at each fracture. "Coincidence had never been random" crystallizes the thematic reversal with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently from isolation through memory-gathering to the discovery of the black obelisk representing suppressed trauma, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira integrates the excluded grief into the archive. The cost is legible when "She realized that identity was not sculpted like marble but [woven from what chose her]" and the fog fractures, showing connection restored through accepting pain.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from entering the fortress to creating new stars, with the mosaic serving as the pivotal discovery. The closure lands with visible cost (sacrificing her performance tool) and resonant reconfiguration (transforming despair into hope). The three-line mosaic progression effectively tracks the transformation. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of siblings reconnecting through shared grief. The unmailed letter revelation reweights their mother's silence with conceptual cost ("decided silence was kinder"). Closure lands with felt cost as they process the letter together, though the final chronicler's note edges toward explicit theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the porcelain doll becomes an archway and the bunker-builder becomes a gardener, with clear cost (years of confinement, tears of forgiveness). The accumulative structure coheres through the silence-collection motif. Slight opacity in the gravity-inversion mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - the child's transformation from burden to lightness. The storm glass's weather patterns create visual causality linking emotional states to closure. Cost is visible in "tears drying under starlight" and the child stepping off "lighter, suitcase no longer dragging."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne gains a keeper, not a king, reweighting the entire journey from ascension quest to memory preservation. The accumulative lens holds as paint layers, murals, and memories build density toward the final image of the keeper generating new ruby flakes for future seekers. Cost is visible in her sealed isolation and the transformation from archivist to eternal guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as the sanctuary dissolves and the protagonist understands "every bridge burned had been a door opening somewhere else," transforming absence into potential. The accumulative structure builds through layered imagery of scars, shadows, and burning. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's regret literally crystallizes into diamond through accumulated pressure, with visible cost ("pressure shared is pressure transformed"). The accumulative lens holds as spore imagery, texts, and compression metaphors build toward this transformation, though the quantum pyramid backstory slightly dilutes focus.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition ("golden shadows," "standing wave") building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from destroyer to beginning. The cost is legible in her burial of the crank handle and whispered name. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of Lira's role as "dynasty ender" but the closure lands with clear before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Calen crosses the threshold into "branching dawns," having merged with the puppet to fulfill his oath. The accumulative lens holds throughout with increasing density of magical imagery. Cost is visible in the identity merger ("no longer alone inside his armor"). Slight opacity in the exact nature of the transformation prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with the button discovery triggering memories of J and culminating in forgiveness and renewed purpose. The closure—forgiving the father and committing to share stories of kindness—lands with emotional cost visible in "she forgave him in the silence between streetlights." However, the ending cuts off mid-sentence, weakening the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well - fragments of erased history build toward the broadcast that transforms them into active resistance. The closure (broadcasting forbidden histories through the lagoon) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: tomorrow's return implies ongoing danger. The puddle-map revelation midway provides the crucial turn that enables action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the saxophonist's choice to play silence rather than sound, transforming catastrophe into "a paper boat no bigger than a tear." The cost is legible in "the absence of the prophecy felt like music he would spend the rest of his life learning to play"—a lifetime commitment to subtraction over addition.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian joins the eternal cycle, with clear cost (dissolution of body into "motes of walnut-stained light"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as leaves progressively reveal choreography leading to transformation, and the circular structure ("hush where past meets prophecy" returns) reinforces the cyclical theme.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition ("coincidence becomes pattern") drives the descent and discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms his practice from restoring certainty to calibrating uncertainty. The cost is visible in clients accepting backward-running clocks and Elian's contentment to "live in the pause between ticks." Slight deduction for the admiral's backstory section feeling somewhat detached from present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms regret into "ballast" rather than burden, with visible cost in accepting her mother's failure as part of her inheritance. The accumulative lens holds as alchemical transformations build toward this reweighting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2. Slight deduction for the zodiac coin's mechanics feeling somewhat arbitrary to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from individual confession to collective harmony, with the crocodile's tooth serving as causal bridge between boatman and musician. The closure—integrated laughter humming behind ribs—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("knot she had carried for centuries dissolving"). The orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from disorientation through mathematical pattern-finding to integration, with the pewter strap's burial marking decisive change. The cost is legible in "every scream absorbed, every volt reabsorbed into the larger equation of living." The forest-as-nervous-system revelation deepens rather than explains, maintaining the textural lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator chooses to remain as translator rather than ascend, with visible cost in separation from sister and childhood companions. The accumulative structure coheres through the lighthouse fragment as a persistent constraint linking market-painting-memory-return. Deduction for occasional opacity in transitions (the painting scene's reality-shift mechanics) and the abrupt cutoff that leaves the final ship moment incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where placing the mainspring transforms the space and releases both ghosts and protagonist. Cost is legible in "stepped out of her own skin and found it still fit" and her departure from her profession. The accumulative lens holds throughout, though some middle passages meander slightly before the powerful ending sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the operator dissolves into language itself, with clear cost (library's destruction, her dissolution). The accumulative pattern of uncorked whispers building to rupture holds consistently. Minor orientation wobble with "reality became negotiable" but the who/where anchors sufficiently by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where the archaeological dispute dissolves into shared stewardship, with visible cost in Mara confronting her betrayal. The accumulative structure coheres through mirror/time imagery building toward transformation. Deduction for late orientation (the archaeological dispute central conflict isn't clear until paragraph 5) and some causality softness in how quickly the Company enforcers become listeners.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong closure with Midnight's transformation and the fusion of twilight/dawn gear creating genuine change. The covenant dissolving delivers visible cost and reconfiguration. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The causal chain from Emil's truth-telling through Midnight's revelation to final synthesis holds under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and images build toward Elara's Earned Stasis—refusing to cross the membrane while gifting the compass upward. The closure lands with felt cost in "lungs aching" and "heart forgiving itself," making the before/after legible. Who/where/when anchored early ("factory shut down on a Tuesday," "sub-basements").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure with the archway transformation serving as the central organizing principle. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the blank slide revealing the loop's nature, with visible cost in Mara's acceptance of her temporal role. The piece teaches its time-loop pattern early and pays it off, though some middle transitions feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through repeated imagery of moonflowers, postcards, and etched glass until the mother's postcard provides a Resonant Reconfiguration: "They bloom for the dark because the dark remembers them." The cost is felt in Liora's acceptance that connection doesn't require physical presence, though the extended denouement after line 28 slightly dilutes the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara transforms from passive archivist to active witness, with visible cost in her staggering and the "retrocognitive hold loosen, not releasing her but transforming into responsibility." The cipher's solution through empathy rather than logic provides causal linkage, and the final image of the zeppelin carrying "unburied truth toward courts" crystallizes the reconfigured stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from memory fragments to conceived civilization, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the alchemist transforms from guardian of memory to architect of revival. The closure lands with visible cost—his solitary departure and the town's tentative awakening behind him. The orientation is clear early (deserted alchemist, Paper-Lantern Cove, after the last lantern), and the accumulation of sensory memories drives toward the theatrical proclamation and final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elowen's promise to carry the city's pulse reweights the entire piece. The cost is legible in "recording nothing, listening at last"—she abandons her archival role for reciprocal connection. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the prophecy's emergence could be slightly more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when she understands "inheritance is not property but permission" after touching the vortex membrane, with visible cost in her careful withdrawal to prevent tearing. The accumulative lens holds as image patterns (seeds, spirals, cold/heat) build toward this crystallized understanding that reweights the opening mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from "solstice hush" through instrumental readings to the bell's "oceanic note" that reconfigures the sanctuary's purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the tester accepts the rope and teaching role, with cost visible in "weight settle like responsibility" and the year-long commitment ahead. The piece teaches its pattern of silence/listening early and pays it off when "the mountain's weather restored to equilibrium."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with the station coming alive and the janitor departing to follow another silence, showing clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres well under the textural lens, though the cost could be more visceral—"letting darkness pour in" and "wearing the sky's unfinished story" approach abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through ghost encounters, strip readings, and the spiral pattern discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the recluse accepts his role as keeper. The closure shows visible cost (ghosts fading into the spiral, box locking) and transforms the wasteland into a luminous covenant space. Orientation anchors arrive late (recluse's former role as covenant scribe at ~20%), causing minor early drift.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist gains understanding of time's textures through embodied memory, meeting someone who "remembers tomorrow." The urn fragment's fusion with the gear creates a "compass pointing toward the next moment worth living," with clear emotional cost paid through grief and recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the chest-string "unbinding" reweights all prior tending acts as preparation for release rather than repair. The accumulative structure teaches its pattern early through repeated acts of harmonizing discord. Cost is legible in "the kite string's snap a kind of caesura" and the final stepping "forward into the widening space."

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through systematic discoveries (three architectural secrets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's death becomes transmission through the copper circuitry she laid. The cost is unmistakable in "the moonflowers opened on cue, silver petals trembling to the hush of her last breath." The lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mara lifted by bronze wings, though the story cuts off mid-sentence without completing the final image. The accumulative lens holds as sculptures progressively animate and the amber's transformation catalyzes the ending. Cost is visible in Mara's dissolved skepticism and ancestral weight she absorbs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the battlefield blooms into a garden that "reclaims what war had taken," with visible cost in the coachman's years of patient labor and his mother's death. The accumulative structure coheres through nightly ritual repetition building to transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (coachman, jetty, twilight) and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the dog accepting "paths that no longer need bodies to prove they exist" - a genuine foreclosure of his original purpose with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details layer into revelation. Orientation anchors clearly (bloodhound, wasteland settlement, post-war). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the cylinder's grooves translate to forest projections.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where sketching compresses timelines and frees Captain Lys. The cost is legible—trading linear time for connection—and the compass rose becoming a "second heart" charges the final image. Minor orientation wobble around "temporal refugees" initially unclear, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation from climbing to steal wonder to becoming its apprentice, with clear cost in releasing his hidden identity and the dawn. The accumulative lens holds as images layer—wrong sky, chess exchange, melting ice, leap into light—building to "everything amends." Minor orientation delay (who Lira is) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara accepts her role as guardian of "luminous absence," with visible cost in releasing her old scripted identities. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the walking patterns that spell words, building to the final "STAY." The orientation anchors clearly (palace, interregnum, post-fire) and the piece teaches its lyric logic early through the chessboard metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where speaking the lost language transforms the mountain into home, with visible cost in "mercury tears." The closure lands with "understanding the shape of home" as reconfigured meaning, though the final line cuts off mid-sentence, slightly weakening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Arlen accepts forgiveness and the village breathes again, with cost visible in "years" of exile and the prodigy's disappearance. The accumulative structure coheres through chess/weaving metaphors. Deducting for slight ambiguity around the prodigy's actual fate and whether the labyrinth experience is literal or psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as towers transform from "monuments to punishment" to "instruments" through Lysandra's poetry-induced light refraction, with visible cost in the cracked spire and her risked exile. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from single poem to symphony to canyon-wide transformation, though the guards' instant conversion strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue dissolves into gold dust that fuels the engines, transforming from confessor to literal sustenance for the journey. The cost is visceral—isolation continues but with purpose. The accumulative structure coheres through the crater-memory mapping system. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (workshop's nature emerges gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the painter's act of leaving the blank shell for others constitutes Earned Stasis with clear cost ("forgive the leaving"). The accumulative structure coheres through the seashell's transformation from painted sunrise to blank canvas, and the mirror's crack-to-scar arc frames the journey effectively, though the cave discovery feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the lighthouse transforms from warning to welcoming through Mara's scream, with visible cost in her collapse and the captain's tears. The accumulative structure coheres well though the village-wide transformation strains credibility. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she crosses to her brother and receives the cooled bronze—a reversal of the opening's heat that crystallizes the migration's completion with visible cost (cut hands, seared palms). The accumulative structure coheres through the seven-night pattern building to this earned reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira transforms from isolated forager to "caretaker" through planting the glass eye, with visible cost of binding herself to the unstable orchard. The mycorrhizal network accepting the eye creates both literal and metaphorical anchoring. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (ravine location unclear until cave scene) and some causality softness around how the eye actually stabilizes the trees.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper accepts his role as guardian of both ships and memories, with clear cost ("isolation is no longer empty; it is witnessed"). The accumulative structure coheres through gaps/absences building to memory transfer. The promise to "hold your circle until the sea gives you back" crystallizes the transformation with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain from promise to journey to decision, with clear Earned Stasis closure - Elias refuses the doorway with visible cost ("no longer lonely, carrying the letter D and the map of a promise kept"). The matrix chip functions as a persistent constraint throughout. Minor deduction for slightly delayed spatial anchoring in the cavern sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen's integration with her younger self transforms the crown from burden to blessing, with visible cost in her willingness to return each summer. The accumulative structure coheres through the firefly/lantern motif, bleeding starlight imagery, and the ember grotto's transformation, though the mystical mechanics of the child-self appearance strain credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the friends transform their understanding of time from capture to choice, with visible cost in crushing the last pocket-sun. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from arrival through revelation to transformation, though the conceptual weight occasionally outpaces dramatic pressure in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when she burns the scroll and accepts "chaos had always been the truest narrative" with visible cost (bleeding thumb, lost chronicle). The accumulative lens holds through temporal layering and image density. Deduction for slight orientation confusion in the flying sequence and the ambiguous final line cut-off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through sensory substitution patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers new perceptual pathways. Cost is visible in her "blunted life" and the grandmother's inheritance she must reinterpret, though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully - scars literally transform into pages/book with visible cost (burning lungs, physical shedding). The accumulative structure coheres as ritual elements build toward crystallization. The cost is unmistakable: "lungs burned; the held breath felt like molten glass inside her ribs." Minor deduction for orientation arriving gradually rather than anchored by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost's dissolution into "almost-music" and the orchard's singing destruction reweight the opening's "imperfect miracle." The apple-seed rest functions as both literal notation and conceptual bridge. Cost is legible in "stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase" and the exorcist's inability to look back. The accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through density increases and pattern breaks toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the witness absorbs the library and becomes its keeper. The cost is legible in the dissolution of separation and the weight of carrying "everything and nothing." Minor orientation delays (who/where anchors arrive late) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the shepherd's ritualistic adjustments building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he dissolves into "the interval between two ticks." The closure lands with conceptual cost as he sacrifices his physical presence for temporal understanding, though the causality of this transformation relies more on lyric accumulation than clear mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - the specialist transforms from someone who detects intrusions to someone who becomes part of the farm's breathing tissue, with grief as the paid cost. The accumulative structure coheres well through building metaphors of permeability. Minor orientation friction with the familiar stranger's sudden appearance prevents higher scoring, though the lyric mode partially justifies this elision.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara's understanding transforms from mathematical certainty to embracing paradox, with visible cost in "carrying it back downstairs...lighter, as if the deck had finally been shuffled into something she could hold without losing." The accumulative structure coheres as each message deepens her understanding. Slight deduction for predictable message progression.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: Mara's dissolution into "the interval between two notes" transforms her from operator to infrastructure, with clear cost (loss of physical form). The accumulative pattern of wrong numbers → confessions → transformations holds throughout, with Lila's morning humming confirming the reconfiguration's reach.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the archivist transforms from observer to participant, with visible cost in her dissolution "becoming annotation." The accumulative structure coheres through walnut-ink imagery and the mother-daughter parallel, though the mystical mechanics occasionally strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mara's ritual at the station building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases the moon rock to break her isolation. The closure lands with felt cost ("the cavity was warm") and the clock advancing one minute signals change, though the unfinished final sentence weakens impact. Causality holds as her act of trust catalyzes the reciprocal chain that begins healing her loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the realization "she had been mapping herself all along" - a genuine reconceptualization with felt cost as she transforms from mapmaker to living chart. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "uncharted emotional depths" which takes time to ground in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration through the shift from "threshing" to "watering" meaning, with visible cost in the exhausted pen and altered histories. The accumulative lens holds, though early orientation suffers slightly from metaphorical density that delays grounding until ~150 words.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the harbor's final "requiem that was also a lullaby" and his footprints that "would fade by dawn." Cost is felt through submersion and the vintage camera's "memory of applause." Orientation anchors (harbor, moonlight, deaf composer) land early and support the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (phoenixes, volcanic metaphors) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the arsonist becomes what she destroyed. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her freedom to become the archive's living heartbeat, with children finding warm books as proof of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara's redistribution of memories reweights the opening condition with felt cost ("aware she had honored every borrowed heartbeat"). The lagoon's transformation and garden's response provide concrete markers of change, though the exact mechanism of memory transfer remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (violet ribbons, spinning compasses, coin's heat) build toward the resonant reconfiguration where Mara's whisper transforms the entire port's soundscape. The closure lands with clear cost: workers freeze mid-shift, the labyrinth keeps her quiet signature. The magical container space stretches credibility slightly but serves the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as repeated actions (opening shutters, angling the mirror, feeding light to water) build toward the revelation of the child in the pearl. The closure—darkness learning "the shape of the child's missing smile"—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost: the mother's grief and the child's submersion reweight the guardian's nightly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through synchronized displays creating "forests of second thoughts." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the town's collective awakening to new possibilities through chess problems, with visible emotional costs (veteran weeping, teenager forgiving). The pattern teaches itself early through library whispers and magnetic grotto pulls, paying off when displays "click into place" at twilight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught water imagery building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira chooses the island's uncertain freedom over harbor safety. The cost is explicit: "dockhands would speak of Lira in the past tense." Orientation anchors effectively (dock worker, pier, moonlight) and the lyric design coheres through water/dance motifs that charge the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the cedar heart with petal transforms grief into "something that can be held," with visible emotional cost in the farmer's tears. The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery and the performer's ritualistic narration. Orientation anchors (farmhouse, porch, dusk) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "Certainty no longer tremored; it sang" and she dissolves into light-columns, paying the cost of physical form. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through repeated boundary dissolutions. Orientation anchors clearly (poet, atrium, frozen lake) and the pattern teaches itself through quartz harmonics and inversions.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lira accepting flawed perception as artistic method, visible cost paid through bartered awakenings and lost color memories. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated arrangement/awakening patterns, though the phoenix frame feels somewhat ornamental to the core transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bell ringer becomes "no longer pilgrim but sanctuary," with clear cost in accepting permanent residence. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clarifies around word 120) and the final sentence cuts off mid-thought, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (cranes, coordinates, garden) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms into cultivation. The closure lands with clear cost: "locket empty, hands full of seeds" crystallizes the trade-off between mourning and renewal. The brass caretaker's wind-down and transformation into a final crane adds a secondary layer of loss that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Mara discovers value hasn't disappeared but migrated into "gestures, jokes, tattoos, recipes." The accumulative structure coheres through the measuring tape's transformation from commerce tool to mapping instrument, with visible cost in her descent carrying "measured darkness." Who/where/when anchored early through "rain-beaded skylight loft above the abandoned stock exchange."

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the historian's discovery and the pagoda's collapse, with visible cost in the civilization's end and her tears mixing with liquid light. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward the final image of the warm bronze prism. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the archive setting.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the shadow is bound to the stone, reversing the metamorphosis with visible cost ("shadow was not destroyed, merely bound again"). The accumulative pattern of stone/shadow/light imagery coheres meaningfully. The cost is both immediate (Lira must remain vigilant) and future-facing (another will face this choice).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered metaphors of reconstruction and shedding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara achieves "tensile" strength and opens the door carrying the incubator, with visible cost in accepting "righteous action could coexist with regret." The orientation anchors clearly (Mara, workshop, after fraud revealed) and causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught symbolism (hourglass, coffee rings, scars) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases the trapped moment. The closure lands with visible cost—23 years of burden released through blood and acceptance. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. The "displaced miracle" choosing the wrong sibling provides clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory and metaphorical density builds toward Mara's resonant reconfiguration—transforming unused love from a fixed deposit to portable potential. The closure lands with felt cost: "love unused is love still, stored in the dark between heartbeats." Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost through the transformation from fear to acceptance ("I will carry the unwritten inside me until it learns to burn quietly"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the snowfall-as-words image. Slight opacity in the middle section about "sleeping gods" and their measurement weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the guard's transformation into a dispersed guardian-cultivator, with clear cost ("occasionally he is everywhere, a wave function of guardianship"). The accumulative pattern of burns/rebirths, dreams/sparks, and archive/forest coheres at the ending where "the continent itself hums like the inside of a clock." Early orientation anchors (dreamless freight guard, glowing dune, archive) establish the surreal logic that pays off in the quantum-state resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from philosopher to pure frontier consciousness. The closure lands with felt cost as she dissolves her identity ("First went her name, then her regrets") to achieve her goal, leaving only a bronze leaf as proof.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ritual elements toward the boy's transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the stone's warmth births the light-thread, though the mechanism feels slightly convenient. Cost is visible in the boy walking forward "without looking back" - a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (bolt appearing, crack widening, gate manifesting) that reweight the fortress's true nature. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost: the fortress crumbles as the bellhop chooses memory over safety. The upward-falling snow and transformation from "cobalt fortress under snow" to "stone under stars" provides resonant closure with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library's "new, honest configuration" reweights all prior false annotations. The revelation that the pretender is a librarian's apprentice who weaponized marginalia creates perfect ironic cost. Minor deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the who/what.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara discovers paths don't vanish but "wait for witnesses willing to descend." The closure lands with visible cost—she must risk descent into an impossible underwater chamber—and the final image of her resumed vigil, now "anchored to both sky and abyss," reweights her initial isolation. The mysterious coordinates appearing in her own unwritten hand and the ocean's coded responses create sufficient causality within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts her role as keeper/transmitter of the rebellion's song. The cost is visible—she won't fly but will wait and load cargo, trading grand action for patient service. The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and the stones' hum that builds to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where unsealing the embryo creates "deliberate becoming" with visible cost (yearly negotiation replacing certainty). The accumulative lens holds throughout with increasing symbolic density. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Minor friction: the embryo's implanted thoughts feel slightly convenient despite being earned by the plant-speech logic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Mira transforms her relationship to trauma from churning to settled "silt in clear water," with visible cost in leaving the photograph. The accumulative structure coheres through returning to sensory anchors and the olive tree as witness, though the closure could sharpen its precise cost beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered imagery (dust as plankton, walls as ribs, memories as threads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira accepts that "redesign is not escape but acceptance rendered visible." The cost is legible in her descent into "necessary darkness," the luminescent ache that "brightened, sharp and clean," and her final carrying of only "the memory of luminescent ache."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of ink, time, and consciousness building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Alba helps reverse the temporal trap. The closure lands with visible cost—researchers frozen in "eternal terror"—but the final line cuts off mid-sentence, undermining full resolution. Causality holds as Alba's calm allows her to perceive what others couldn't.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from vault entry to information release with decisive change landing on-page. The closure shows visible cost through "contraband truths and her own quietly scandalized soul." Minor deduction for slightly rushed escalation in the middle section where the discovery-to-decision beat could be more granular.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lila offers the rose and the boy flees with it, crystallizing her method of resistance through cultivation rather than violence. The "engraved quiet shift[ing] into something new—not silence, but a listening" provides conceptual cost. Accumulative structure coheres through rose/sand/memory patterns building to this transformed transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira trades her defining coolness for the goddess's echo, with visible cost as "the rail spike drank her heat, turning from cold iron to glowing brand." The accumulative lens holds as patterns break and reweight through sound, silence, and constellation movements, though the orientation could anchor "who" slightly earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Octavia's mathematical proof causing the satellite's destruction at 4:09, with visible cost in her moist eyes and the realization that "regret might scatter into smaller fragments." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the satellite's burn. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "orbits of regret" that occasionally obscures concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern teaching through the laboratory's lost sounds accumulating toward the binding ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the tattooist transforms her haunting into something she can carry without hearing it scream, with clear cost (the permanent tattoo on her throat, the dated amber). The fantastical elements are taught early and remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the artist becomes a teacher of silence, carrying the grotto's gift to the world. Cost is visible in the memories dissolving into pigment and the "burden of being remembered" released, though the final image could land with more decisive weight.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward the plaza's transformation through tessera placement. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the plaza "exhales" and transforms from graveyard to "breathing confession" with clear cost (weeks of labor after loss). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. Deduction for slight ambiguity in how the retrocognitive element functions causally.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost's dissolution becomes generative—"each mote carrying a seed of future orchards." The cost is palpable as she sacrifices form for continuity. The fractured timeline resolves into "the hush before the overture when anything could still happen," a Charged Poise that reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara accepts the somatic markers as a "compass" despite her skepticism, with the cost being her surrender of certainty. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering (static shock→tingling→warmth→ripples). Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some opacity around the pill's actual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sensory mapping (violet longing, amber wonder, green ache) that reweights meaning at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Lira transforms from mapper to voice by letting the unknown speak through her, with clear cost (surrendering her role/recorder). The fossil's dissolution into the sleeper and return "lighter now, its history rewritten" crystallizes the transformation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual framing of the sleeper's awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the hourglass sand running upward "measuring possibility instead of loss" reweights the entire piece. The cost is felt through the warehouse transformation and the turner's acceptance of cyclical duty. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the prophecy's question format.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through coded messages, compass rose echoes, and the pillbox halves reuniting to create a Resonant Reconfiguration where reconciliation becomes possible. The cost is legible in "fixing what's broken was not erasing the scar but tracing it until it became a map"—acknowledging permanent damage while finding a path forward. Early orientation anchors (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring) establish place immediately, and the pattern of discovery-through-codes maintains coherent pressure toward the rooftop reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the coachman accepts the yarn needle, crystallizing his role in an eternal cycle of grief-ferrying with visible cost (his daughter's memory distilled to a bead). The accumulative structure coheres through the palimpsest metaphor and repeated crossings, though the orientation of who the woman truly is could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered timeline imagery until the final "petal by petal" closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost—Kiran must continuously choose between realities, understanding that "resistance to change is not stillness but continuous, careful turning." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira transforms from passive pruning to active revival, with green sap beading as proof of change. The brass tooth shifts from memorial object to functional tool, and the rose from dying to budding. Cost appears in physical exhaustion and the vulnerability of "cupping a match flame in bare hands." The accumulative structure coheres through the rowing rhythm that links grandfather's wisdom to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira transforms from archivist of finished lives to carrier of living memory, with the cost of leaving her sanctuary visible in "the library closed its wings...satisfied that another archivist had learned." The accumulative structure coheres around the transformation of isolation into motion, though the orientation takes slightly long to anchor (who/where clarifies around word 150).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where releasing the words creates visible connection. However, the closure's cost remains abstract—"confidence the bronze tree outside was already scripting" doesn't show concrete loss or price. The orientation anchors (lotus temple, after rain) establish setting adequately. The transformation from holding secrets to releasing them tracks, but the mechanism (steam ghost writing revealing connections) feels unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong causal chain: signal discovery → counter-signal deployment → trickster retaliation → mirror solution, with clear because/therefore linkages throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirrored signal transforms the tricksters' weapon and the town "no longer quite so eager to tear itself apart" - visible social cost paid. The orientation anchors (radio station, Lyra, signal threat) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara fuses the compass halves, transforming both the labyrinth and herself—the maze "exhaled" and releases her while she gains a star-chart "etched in light across her skin." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as spatial descriptions and organ reverberations build toward this crystallized moment, with clear cost in her mother's permanent dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the reunited ribbon forms "a perfect circle, midnight blue on one side, blood-red on the other" and Elias recognizes "the single face he could always recognize: the human face." Cost is visible in his tears and the woman's dissolution. Orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the abrupt cutoff that weakens the final beat's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns building through coded stanzas toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila accepts Morag's place. The exchange mechanism and its cost are dramatized on-page, with the final image of Lila wearing Morag's coat crystallizing the transformation. Orientation anchors (weather station, Cape Wrath, Lila as librarian) establish cleanly within the first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the fiddler alone on the bridge of transformed "nevers," having traded connection for possibility—a clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres as glass fragments pixelate into doors, then stairs, then bridge. Minor orientation friction exists (the hitchhiker's simultaneous presence/absence) but the pattern teaches itself and pays off at closure where isolation becomes the price of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Leo burns his last tangible assets (the foreign bills) to protect the space through ritual confusion of the drones. The accumulative texture builds effectively through currency-as-memory toward the final transformation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (circus train location/timeframe) and the convenient months-later coda that dilutes immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the telegram transforms into a seed for future healing, with visible cost (surrendering their heaviest burdens). The accumulative structure coheres well through the variable stars motif and shared witnessing, though the temple materialization stretches credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the druid unbends her defensive armor with visible cost (blood feeding the plant). The accumulative/textural lens holds through imagery and pattern, though the conjurer's return from death weakens causal integrity at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost—Lyra's surrendered memories become the price for temporal restoration. The accumulative structure coheres as maze imagery, scars, and covenant language build toward her transformation into "the new covenant, root-bound yet free." However, the worldbuilding around orbital mirrors and "the future arrived early" creates some orientation friction that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Lira's soul-holes close through root-stitching, her "dusky resolve now shared by every shadow." The accumulative lens holds as imagery patterns (roots/bones/grafting) build toward this transformation, though the middle section could tighten between initial ritual and Ardan's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward Elliot's decision to act. Closure lands as Decisive Change when he chooses to pocket the cloth and drive to the singer's sister—a concrete action breaking months of stasis with visible cost. The final lines "It wasn't empty. It was waiting" create Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Lila's transformed understanding of translation, with visible cost in the scar and her choice to offer only metaphor instead of data. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each interaction with the tree deepens her comprehension. The "who/where/when" anchors establish clearly by line 2-3.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the smelting of stories building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the librarian accepts her contradictory nature, creating the pearl that contains all stories. Cost is visible in the "serene exhaustion" and the permanent fusion of gears to spine. The incomplete final sentence weakens closure impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the pearl's transformation dissolves barriers between isolated people, with visible cost in Mara abandoning her inspector role. The pattern of confession→light→connection builds coherently. Minor deduction for slightly rushed transition from personal to collective transformation in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist achieves self-forgiveness through ritual action and leaves the accordion as payment. The map's transformation from geographic guide to "chart of the chest cavity" effectively reweights the journey's meaning. Cost is visible in the abandoned instrument and "weight of one withheld confession."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered echoes (lullaby returns as harmony, signatures bleed backward) until the final release reweights everything with clear cost—the library fades. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she releases rather than takes the words, with the confidence man's watch cracking but becoming "honest."

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's final bow stroke that transforms the observatory into "a hothouse of impossible midsummer snow." Cost is visible in the empire's arrival and her choice of "forests humming the glacier's true name" over "gold, titles, a conservatory." The accumulative lens holds, though the abrupt ending mid-sentence weakens the final beat's full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the mortician transforms from collector to distributor of sparks, with visible cost in surrendering all she's gathered. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns layer (spirals in wind, threshold, palms, faces) toward the density shift when "every life she had touched singing in harmony." Causality tracks cleanly from corpse's chip to grotto ascent to threshold activation to descent with new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Lira accepts the endless cycle of tending with visible cost ("not as triumph, but as the gentle weight of responsibility"). The accumulative lens holds through imagery patterns (scalloped light, cycles, tending). Deduction for the mother's ghost explicitly stating the theme mid-story rather than letting it emerge through action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward Lira's acceptance that "being sincerely insincere was the only honest way." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she holds the copper chime "that had always sounded like her mother's voice saying maybe," though the text cuts off mid-sentence. Cost is visible in the shared hesitation woven into her cloak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise: "I am already gone, and that is how I remain" crystallizes the paradox with felt cost. The backwards temporal structure coheres under accumulative logic, though the truncated ending ("each footfall er") undermines full closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the skimmer becomes a tower of bone, transforming from seeker to map itself. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices movement and individual existence to complete the navigation paradox, with the arrowhead embedding permanently in her chest.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through impossible imagery until the keystone's release triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian's acceptance of ordinariness over extraordinary ambition. The cost is legible in "he stopped trying to be extraordinary and let the ordinary save him," though the incomplete final sentence weakens the closure's full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren's discovery reweights all prior sounds and her relationship to the drowned. The final image of her striking the lamp to release the color-sound creates visible transformation with clear cost (releasing the key, ending her solitary quest). Who/where/when anchored early through "late-shift pier lamplighter" and "sky lantern release."

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The backwards prophecy structure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's present alignment becomes the light that started everything, with clear cost (her dissolution). The accumulative pattern of coin arrangements building to wavelength alignment holds consistently, though the dense conceptual layering occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the reaper transforms from "heartbroken" to "no longer entirely heartbroken," with visible cost paid through accepting the names into his hollow chest. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each discovered name builds toward this transformation. Slight opacity in the exact nature of his past sacrifice prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Calen's act of naming the bosun transforms his brittle devotion into something "flexes like green wood." The accumulative lens holds through dripping patterns, mercury counting, and the final image of the bell keeping time. Cost is visible in the choice he must relive and the hair-cord sacrifice. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lila transforms from solitary keeper of guilty knowledge to community truth-teller, with visible cost in her father's death and twenty years of burden. The accumulative lens holds as photographs, mirror scene, and confession build density toward collective healing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the alchemist dissolves into light/birds, with visible cost (loss of physical form) and conceptual repricing (logic and intuition unified in flight patterns). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "the final transformation" which remains somewhat vague despite the concrete ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Zev's continued vigilance despite exhaustion, with visible cost in his physical state and the weight of memory. The closure lands with felt cost ("steps making no more noise than the stars"), though the orientation takes slightly too long to fully anchor (who Zev is becomes clear around word 150).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the three entities form "a circuit of mutual recognition," transforming custody battle into shared stewardship with visible emotional cost ("tears return, salt stinging like thaw"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through micro-memories, shared breathing, and rain imagery. Minor orientation debt: the relationship between Kael and Kael-2's divergence point remains vague, though this doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's dissolution of her master key transforms the escape room into a self-evolving entity—visible cost in surrendering control with the line "the mirrors now showed her not as proprietor but as caretaker." The accumulative lens holds through mysterious seed growth, architectural mutations, and final merger. Slight opacity in the cavern mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Elara's ritual builds from silence through two "movements" to restore laughter, with clear cost in her grief work. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the house begins laughing and a leaf lifts "unaided." Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and slightly abstract mechanism of how the blower actually restores laughter to sleeping guests.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the guardian transforms from rigid boundary-keeper to one who "invited uncertainty to tea," with visible cost in releasing the pendant and accepting dimensional distance from its library. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details ("frost patterns rearranged into unfamiliar alphabets") and metaphysical shifts accumulate toward the reconfigured stance. Minor opacity around the child-absence's initial nature slightly dulls early causality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through successive approximations toward a Decisive Change—the crozier's vivification and release. Cost is visceral: blood covenant, transferred memories, and the alchemist's transformation from "hopeless" to "merely an alchemist." The pattern of ritual additions (breath, ink, thread, blood) creates causal linkage that culminates in the winged crozier's birth and mission.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael discovers "beginnings are not fixed points but echoes that choose where to start," with visible emotional cost paid through his grief transforming into the warm sphere. The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery patterns (hush, static, frequencies). Orientation anchors arrive smoothly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Cass embraces her role as timeline guardian, with visible cost in her permanent liminality ("guardian of the threshold, ferryman to the almost-lost"). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught time distortions. The orientation anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mara becoming "the seam" between illusion and reality, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The accumulative structure coheres well with each weaving action building toward inevitable integration. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through layered images (drowned moons, unfolded horizons, stars as braille) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the abyss becomes "another sky." Cost is legible in the wife's death, the council's prohibition, and the instructor's isolation as she leaves "the known grid." The final teaching moment crystallizes the transformation with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara accepts her expanded role as witness to both living and dead, with clear cost in carrying their weight ("The last photograph in her pocket felt heavier now"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the final sentence cuts off mid-thought, slightly weakening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara becomes "keeper of the unremembered," with visible cost in her repeated returns and acceptance of enclosed spaces. The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight dock for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the underwater facility setting.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (heartbeat counting, ink patterns, mandala formation) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "identity is not a file to be deleted but a pattern to be completed." Cost is visible through heartbeat depletion (120→100) and the protagonist accepting both stories. The orientation anchors (opal observatory, death certificate context) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the language dies but its texture persists in the storyteller's transformed body and the healed diamond. The piece teaches its pattern early (bone towers as syllable monuments) and pays it off when they crumble into "phonetic dust." Cost is visible in the copper veins hardening and the towers collapsing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from underground listening to cosmic transformation, with the metamorphosis serving as decisive change with clear cost (Vale losing human form). The closure lands powerfully as she and Orion become the very cryptids she once researched, spreading "temporary galaxies." Slight deduction for the abstract "We became the joke the sky tells itself" which strains comprehension momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the orchard transforms from mechanical to living through accumulated musical pressure, with visible cost (teacher's disappearance, shell crumbling to dust). The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-building. Slight opacity in the opening metaphysical framing ("gap between knowing and understanding") prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the father's button and note ("Tell her I'm learning to mend what I broke"), transforming the premise from linking absences to fostering presence. The accumulative texture builds through storm/promise imagery, with visible cost in Lila's three lost birthdays and Six's disputed territory navigation. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the carousel's resurrection and the carpenter's voice threading through frost to teach the world silence as invitation. The cost is legible: years of mute service transformed into song. The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the abstract "whispering gleam that said go" near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library transforms from passive repository to active voice-holder, with clear cost in Mireille's new burden ("feeling its new weight of voices"). The accumulative lens holds as geometric distortion and sensory details build to the copper book discovery. Orientation anchors (3:17 a.m., scientific poetry library, Mireille) land within first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the librarian accepting her shadowless state while the dream-child gains substance. Cost is visible through traded shadow and the child's departure with the palette. The cipher/map device and sunrise photography method cohere well, though the opening could anchor location more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the melody's release reweights the entire world, bringing back missing constellations and awakening dormant mosaics. The accumulative lens holds consistently through metaphorical layering. Cost is visible in the seven-year journey and Aelira's trauma. Minor orientation wobble early but recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (habit breaking, constellation shattering) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where recovered memories return "seasoned by absence." Cost is visible in the shard left as payment and years settling "heavier now." The orientation anchors (greenhouse, Elara, decades later) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres elegantly through the tea-leaf ritual that bridges past and present selves. The closure achieves a true Resonant Reconfiguration as "exile ends where stewardship begins," with visible cost in the girl's "tremor of newfound weight." The piece teaches its magical logic early and maintains consistency throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Arin transforms into the braided tree, with visible cost (his body silvering, breath thinning). The accumulative lens holds as imagery layers build to this transformation. Minor orientation friction with the two-world concept initially abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the ritual—each knot releases accumulated silence until the final transformation where spirits are freed and Lira's own mask becomes "whole." Closure lands with visible cost: "tomorrow new silences would begin to gather" acknowledges the ongoing burden. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final map transforms tears from damage into deliberate seams, with cost legible in "every blank on parchment was a wound." The accumulative lens holds as shadows grow fingers, maps tear identically, and absence gains presence through layered revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the snow globe "still teaching libraries and skeletons the eloquence of letting go" with visible cost in the narrator's empty palms and renunciation of answers. The accumulative structure coheres as metaphysical exploration builds to physical release. Minor orientation wobble around the library's nature (real/metaphorical) doesn't harm closure but prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the ghost transforms from haunting to harmony, with Lira's dissolution into music as visible cost. The accumulative pattern builds through pressed flowers encoding unspoken needs, culminating in the ghost's integration. The "between lightning and thunder" frame provides temporal pressure that shapes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the rooftop revelation where the captain laughs "like engines restarting." The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration through the goggles' cracked-lens aurora—lands with emotional cost ("tears freezing into brief crystals"). The diary decryption provides causal linkage while the elevator's ascent creates natural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Conceptual Repricing closure—Mira's discovery that atmosphere is a "memory palace" reweights her entire worldview with professional and personal cost visible in her commitment to teach others. The broken tether creates immediate pressure that forces her emotional cloud taxonomy work. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the gondola situation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Lira completes her mural knowing it will be destroyed, with the cost visible in the building's demolition and the guild's erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the climactic painting scene, though the orientation arrives slightly late (past 120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through spiral pattern discoveries leading to the lens revelation and coordinate plotting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora becomes "the map" the light follows home, with professional risk ("Captain Rens would scold") providing visible cost. The final line trails off awkwardly but doesn't break the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the locksmith becomes part of the mechanism she sought to repair, with clear cost ("felt her joints click into the grand mechanism"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through moonscript → gears → mirrors → final fusion. "When the last gear turns, the locksmith becomes the lock" crystallizes the transformation with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught chalk messages building to collective action. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Luma dissolves into the bell, becoming "perpetual dew" with visible cost (her ghostly existence ends). The orientation anchors (Orchard Planet, floating arches, ghost status) establish cleanly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the truncated ending "Years later, Kiran—now" which slightly weakens the final beat's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist absorbs the pane of hush, transforming from adjuster to carrier of the world's lullaby—visible cost shown through "cities unbuilt, loves unmet, songs unsung." The accumulative lens holds consistently through nested patterns and mirror reflections. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, clock adjuster) establish clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Nadia's departure reweights all prior material—the nut releases smoke, she exhales grandfather's works, and leaves moonlight footprints after never touching the cliffside. The lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Cost is legible in the transformation from cautious non-touching to leaving impressions everywhere. Minor orientation wobble with the labyrinth's spatial relationship to the orchard slightly unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where "atonement was not erasure but incorporation" with visible cost in her volunteer work at burn wards. The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-building. Deduction for the somewhat abstract conceptual leap in "polymer of memory instead of loss" that could use more grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the vendor transforms from clean slate prisoner to listener/herald through discovering that absence generates presence. The cost is legible—"glimmering parole" requires serving stories through forgiveness, paid when the vendor steps back to become "merely a listener." The accumulative structure coheres as each counted absence builds toward the final insight that "stories can begin here because they have already begun where absence is largest."

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where crystallized grief transforms into "salt flowers" that can be borne. The cost is visible in both Lira's absorption of pain and the lord's twenty years of suffering. The accumulative texture coheres beautifully through the memory-cooking process.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silos learn to communicate. However, the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see transformation but not what Sora sacrifices or risks. The line "knowing acres now spoke instead of stood" gestures at change without dramatizing the price of this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the engineer integrates entangled memories through synaptic modification, transforming both herself and the canyon. The accumulative lens holds as patterns synchronize and memories restructure "according to their own ancient logic." Cost appears in the physical pain and permanent alteration of consciousness. Orientation anchors clearly (engineer, moonlit canyon, present-day with flashbacks).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through layered imagery (dragon doodle, inverted gravity, threshold effects) toward Charged Poise closure where Lira carries seeds forward, ready to plant them "where they might finally grow." The cost is felt through "knees stinging on cold stone" and the responsibility she now bears. Orientation anchors (grotto, Lira, gravity inversion) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the grove's silence transforms into tentative song, with visible cost in the sculptor's borrowed sorrow and physical ache. The accumulative structure builds through collected micro-resonances (A-flat, B-minor, D notes) toward the birds' return. The piece teaches its pattern of reading fractures and translating grief early. Deduction for the truncated ending that leaves "Empathy in motion, she realizes," incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the dent transforms from mark of failure to teaching tool, with clear cost (three years of exile). The accumulative lens holds as chess metaphors, magnetic fields, and eclipse imagery layer to reweight Kael's understanding. Slight opacity in the nexus's actual mechanics doesn't harm the emotional/conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the diary clasp "locking open forever" and empathy revealed as shared frequency, with visible cost in the thumbprint memory. The accumulative structure coheres as Mira's catalog of silences builds toward understanding. However, the cost could be more visceral—the "moment she almost struck back" remains somewhat abstract despite the thumbprint's physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the corpse flower blooms into journal pages, releasing visible spirals of serenity that calm the village—a genuine transformation with communal cost ("restless hearts" calmed, "fireflies dimmed"). The accumulative structure coheres as seven nights of ritual doodling build to this crystallized moment where "motionless motion" becomes embodied wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's action transforms the grove and her role, with visible cost in the "whirling silence" and permanent change to the orchard. The accumulative structure builds through echo discoveries to the sapling revelation. Slight dock for the convenience of the final notch fitting perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the investigator learns to "open and close in time with the world's hidden breathing," with clear cost (town's silence, Mara's sleepless weeks). The accumulative lens holds through wind patterns, tidal rhythms, and the final image of containers as "letters in a sentence finally completed." Orientation anchors established early.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the marble transforms into a bell that produces "oscillating repose," fundamentally reweighting silence as active rather than absent. The cost is legible in the sculptor's submission and the protagonist releasing "years" of coiled hush. Early orientation is clean (ice cavern, bell ringer, alone). The pattern of synesthetic translation builds coherently toward the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where she shifts from "wall" to "song shared across the breach." The cost is legible in the dissolved guardianship and scarred flute, though the transformation moment itself could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates with the halo fragment's transformation from pulsing sorrow to cracked glass marking a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost manifests through the workshop's dissolution and her acceptance of uncertainty over borrowed certainty. Orientation slightly delayed but serves the disorienting effect; the reversal at "She decided to reverse the process" provides decisive agency though the mechanics of emotional transposition remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mira's role transforms from courier to "bearer of perpetual invitation" with the cost of accepting her mentor's absence into myth. The accumulative structure builds through tollkeeper and stargazer encounters toward this crystallization. Minor orientation wobble early (the ridgeway's geography) but recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Elara releases the prism and accepts a reciprocal truth about emotional exchange. Cost is visible in her forced vulnerability ("a transaction she hadn't consented to") and the foreclosed path of pure objectivity. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. Deduction for the somewhat abstract conceptual shift that could use more embodied grounding in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira accepts one-way hope as the price of impossible distance, with visible cost in her mother's thimble sacrifice and the puzzle's destruction. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the loom/weaving metaphor that bridges her past craft and present quest. The cost is legible in "heart lighter yet heavier" and her acceptance that she'll "never hear her brother's reply."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from the silk's arrival through Elowen's choice to the community's transformation, with the closure showing a Resonant Reconfiguration where memories become the foundation of renewal. The cost is legible in "the absence immediately, a hollow where laughter had been" and the community's willing sacrifice of precious memories for survival.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira embeds the shard, breaking the cycle with clear cost: "threads in a tapestry she would spend her life weaving." The accumulative structure coheres as each universe encounter builds toward understanding the pilot's sacrifice, though the orientation takes ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias bottles the widow's ache and commits to lighthouse-keeping, with visible cost in accepting supernatural responsibility. The accumulative lens holds as images (sea glass, stones, flask) layer toward the final transformation. Minor orientation wobble in the opening's dense metaphor slightly delays anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's transformation into "the laughing storm itself," with visible cost in the lighthouse crumbling to "green dust." The accumulative lens holds as density increases from routine to prophecy to transformation, though the prophetic fracture's mechanics could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered imagery (wing colors mapping memories, spiral descent into Lira's past). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael accepts permeability over watchfulness, with cost visible in "watchful no longer" and the wing's exhaustion. The spiral journey into memory and return creates coherent pressure toward this crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's gradual understanding crystallizing into a Resonant Reconfiguration where the healed sextant becomes "a tool for measuring not just stars but the distance between what was lost and what remains." The cost is legible in the astronomer's death and the transformation of grief into "golden seams," though the causality between finding the sextant and climbing the tower could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the memory keeper accepts her own scattering as seeds, with clear cost (losing her memories) that enables the orchard's survival. The accumulative structure coheres as each woven dawn builds toward the final swaddling. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moment, though "lighter now, seeds on new wind" carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught paradoxes ("dated tomorrow yet postmarked yesterday," "staying while leaving") that accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara chooses not to follow her own map. The cost is legible in "fleeing toward herself" and the conscious choice to break that pattern. Orientation anchors solidly by line 2, and the magical realism rules are taught early through the library's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where planting seeds becomes "signing a treaty with time" with visible cost ("I will forget a little, if you will grow a little"). The accumulative lens holds as disappearances build to transformation through gardening. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2, and the final shoot pushing through frost crystallizes the reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when Elara releases all vows and dissolves with the library, paying the ultimate cost. The accumulative lens holds through repeated phrases and building imagery. Deduction for slight orientation delay (library's nature emerges gradually) and the incomplete final sentence that weakens closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis - Lila's refusal to betray the truce forecloses her father's freedom with visible cost ("the broken watch fob left behind like a promise"). The accumulative build through sensory details and the "false starts" pattern coheres well, though the final line appears truncated, weakening the closure's full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the two climates merge, with visible cost in the ring dissolving into Mara's veins and the aurora surrendering to darkness. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory patterns (taste/weather/metal), though the forests' election subplot slightly dilutes focus.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered object (lock, easel, painting, pigment) deepens the protagonist's return to art, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes both key and lock. Cost is visible in "everyone she ever loved and failed" painted on walls. However, the mechanical repair of the lock with liquid gold strains physical plausibility, and some transitions between memory and present action blur orientation momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where vapor becomes tea plants "etched with remembered voices," transforming the archive's purpose. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered truth builds toward Lysandra's decision to speak honestly. Cost is visible in the wilting plants responding to lies throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the tear preserved in sealskin that "pulsed like a second heart" while children below will wake to "fingers stained with blue." The accumulative structure coheres as each element (bells, ice, bronze petals) builds toward wonder's temporary preservation. Cost is visible in the shrinking glacier fragment surrendering its "final note" and the acknowledged impermanence ("would not last").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered images (static/flame/glass beads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lumen transforms chaos into containment, with clear cost in the roses drinking "from the ashes of his childhood." The closure lands with the android achieving resolution through miniaturization—giving fear "a shape small enough to hold without breaking."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and neighborhood stories braid toward the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration—the courtyard exhaling as collective grief transforms to healing. The locket's return opens the mailbox, revealing letters that name hidden losses, with visible emotional cost ("tears cutting clean paths"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the shard's liberation transforms "stolen fragility" into "steel inside its skin," with clear cost in the jammed lock and abandoned dice. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through dance-cipher, spider's web timing, and the final emergence. Slight deduction for the abstract "lunar shame" tidal pattern that lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from whale's death through gravity pockets to the memory vault, with Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara accesses the pooled memories. The tasting of memory creates visible cost and transformation. Slight opacity around the gravity-memory connection mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the summoner's transformation from silencing to listening, with the prophecy becoming "the space between heartbeats" rather than erased. The accumulative/textural lens coheres through layered imagery and the final cost is legible in her acceptance that "the world would keep its secrets gently." However, the middle section's causality occasionally blurs between metaphysical action and concrete change, particularly around "mapping silence into a spiral."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from seal arrival through weekly lessons to final integration, with the Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully when narrator accepts being "spoken through" and receives the city's morse-code welcome. The cost is legible—accepting a ghostly inheritance and changed identity—though the precise mechanics of "interrogation" remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara integrates the archive internally, with clear cost (garden's dissolution, mother's voice silenced). The accumulative structure coheres through resonance patterns and shell imagery. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the physical mechanics of the "resonance structures" mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's act of unlinking her forgeries and leaving the thorn creates visible cost (seventeen years of identity dissolved) with the key transforming into light as a concrete marker of change. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring motifs (thorn, ink, aurora) that gain weight, though the metaphysical mechanics of the key and sanctuary occasionally strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the singer chooses to preserve rather than break the echo system, with clear cost: eternal resonance. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through musical/geological layering toward this crystallized moment. Deduction for late orientation—the "why" of her quest emerges only mid-story, creating brief comprehension drag.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Nadia's salvage of "pure snow" and the radioman's release. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she extracts untainted memory from disaster, though the cost—while poetic ("wreckage now lighter by one secret")—lacks immediate visceral weight. The orientation anchors (glacier shrine, Nadia as wreck-diver) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the guard taking up the whisk and whistle, with the boy's recognition completing a generational pattern of care. The incomplete final sentence "when he became the harbor's master mender, he would climb the same" creates Charged Poise, crystallizing the cyclical nature of mentorship with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Lina plants the Apple with the paper compass, crystallizing her choice between truth and protection with clear cost: "Some truths, she knew, would rather become trees and bear bitter fruit than become headlines and bear more graves." The wasteland orchard "quietly compassed itself" creates a before/after where memory preservation replaces immediate revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres through static-to-prophecy-to-manifestation, with "Remember" as the first word creating a resonant reconfiguration that reweights all prior gathering. The cost appears in "iron and lilac" taste and the warning that dawn "would not be gentle," though this conceptual cost could be more visceral. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens established through density increase of captured sounds building toward the resonant reconfiguration where released sounds form "a sentence the dunes had waited centuries to hear." The closure lands with visible cost as the poet empties his collection and departs, his footprints erasing. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the pattern of capture-and-release teaches itself through action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from the artifact's weeping through sonic ritual to transformed lullaby, with clear cost (the key's melting, permanent transformation of grief). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira transforms the artifact's dangerous lament into "seeds of quiet joy," though the stakes could be more viscerally felt earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct's emergence transforms both physical landscape and town's understanding of patience. Cost is visible in the elders' tears and the shift from panic to "deliberate wonder." The accumulative lens holds as ice/magnetism/patience imagery builds toward this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through physical discoveries (lantern, compass rose, journal) that reweight Maya's understanding of her father's death. The closure—reframing preventable deaths as "acts of resistance"—lands with clear cost as she abandons Kellerman's methodology. Minor orientation wobble around the Elias Freeman vision slightly softens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from guilt to action to reconciliation, with the clockwork heart serving as the mechanism for transformation. Closure lands with Earned Stasis - Elias's acceptance and the shared listening create visible cost (Rowan's tears, the finite ticking of the heart). The because/therefore logic holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the silent bell transforms the acid sea into crystallized replicas, a Conceptual Repricing where "unheard" becomes planetary propagation. The accumulative lens holds as kaleidoscope patterns build to final sympathetic vibration. Cost is visible in the arrow's dissolution and Orrin's blistered palms.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns compound—117 appearances, layered songs, the patch's warmth—building to Mara's transformation from archivist to wanderer carrying encrypted memory. Cost manifests in her abandonment of position and certainty ("she did not know where deleted files truly go"). Slight deduction for the abrupt final line cutoff and some causality opacity around how the patch stores data in metallic threads.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms the treaty from paper to "living relation" through the mirrors, with visible cost as the fragment dulls and can never show futures again. The accumulative structure coheres as each mirror glimpse builds toward the final harmonics rising from below, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the full stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Mara's role shifts from seeking her own ending to becoming a perpetual witness/teacher of endings, with visible cost in her commitment to "stay and listen until the last floe melts." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the euthanasia tourism context (~150 words).

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught seventh-gap motif that culminates in Resonant Reconfiguration where absence becomes "space granted." The closure lands with felt cost as he transforms the burned letter into root, accepting the mismatch as necessary fertility. Who/where/when anchored early through "amber pavilion," "vineyard sentinel," "vacant station platform."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (diagonal lines, conjured clearings, echo preservation) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where wisdom transforms from ephemeral echo to perpetual communal presence. The cost is legible in the surrender of control ("preservation meant surrendering control") and the walker's transformation to stewardship. Orientation anchors (pavilion, desert, prophet's departure) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as photographs accumulate into a spiral pattern that transforms both field and participants, with the trumpet man hearing "his own lost song returning transfigured" as the resonant reconfiguration. Cost is visible in relinquished memories and tears. The final image of children playing on enriched soil extends the transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the "who."

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the library "begins, very quietly, to grow again" after the scholar's surrender. The cost is legible through his tears and abandonment of decades of scholarly approach. The pattern of sound-as-growth pays off convincingly, though the magical realism elements slightly dilute causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered imagery (fog sculptures, videotapes, chalk spirals) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophet becomes sculpture. The closure lands with clear cost: "visitors found a new sculpture: a man-shaped shell" shows physical transformation as the price of understanding. The pattern of echoes and memory coheres through specific accumulation rather than causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the spinning clock hand's meaning deepens from malfunction to escape metaphor to transformative agent, culminating in Elara's Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is beautifully rendered in "the ache was still there, but it had turned inside out" - a genuine before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the "intact circle of vinyl—now whole in its incompleteness" crystallizes acceptance of imperfect goodbye with visible cost (Mrs. Eland's death). The accumulative structure coheres through vinyl reconstruction metaphor, though early orientation could be cleaner regarding the hospice setting's physical reality "above the clouds."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories layer and loops close toward a Conceptual Repricing: "To relearn is to forgive the forgetting." The incomplete final sentence undermines full closure impact, leaving the merge unresolved on the page. Cost is felt through the shadow-mother reunion but the truncation prevents complete landing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the skeleton transforms into a constellation—a literal manifestation of mistakes becoming guidance. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (tooth, cleft, borrowed/broken) that reweight at the ending. Cost is visible in the dissolved skeleton and the garden sealing itself. Slight opacity in the magic system's rules prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from personal memory through mystical discovery to communal transformation, with the pearl drinking the polished glass creating a decisive change that provides light without fire. The cost—releasing both the glass and her solitary burden—lands clearly in "the lightness of shared sky." The resonant reconfiguration transforms individual watching into collective illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation (dripping water, moss growth, data-to-garden transformation) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms digital wounds into living tissue. The cost manifests as "protected vulnerability" and accepting the slow pace of organic healing versus viral immediacy. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the novelist releases her characters and returns to her study with the fragment "erased into possibility." The accumulative/textural lens holds as each ghostly visitation adds weight until the final naming ceremony. Cost is visible in the fragment's transformation and the "soft finality" of closure, though the mechanism of how she enters/exits this liminal space could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the Heartroot's restoration transforms both physical reality (golden stories flowing) and future possibility (children remembering songs never taught). The accumulative lens holds as each song builds pressure toward transformation. Cost is visible in the decades of silence overcome and Liora's emotional release, though the resolution's completeness slightly dulls the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritual repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where seven paper constellations beat inside her coat, ready to unfold "when the sky remembered how to shine"—a Charged Poise with clear conceptual cost (the withered orchard, the discarded items crumbling to dust). The piece teaches its pattern early through the spiral-building and maintains coherent causality through the alchemical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece where each angle adjustment reveals layered memories that build toward Arlen's final act of preserving wonder at the cost of its natural state. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he stores the reversed timer in his cellar, with clear cost shown through the "empty" cavern and "ordinary winter" that replaces the magical wounded season. The piece teaches its pattern early through the angle/memory correlation and pays it off when the reversed mechanism releases stored echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the weaver transfers human burdens to bronze and stone, with visible cost in her own calcification. The accumulative structure coheres through the burden-sorting sequence, though the village backstory arrives late without earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres through the compression metaphor—from steam rising to thumbprint impressions to final crystallization. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara transforms grief into "something she could finally hold without breaking," with cost visible in the hollows that "caught the light like a tear."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis when Mara releases collected stories and accepts age thirty-three, with the lagoon folding into a coin as payment—visible cost achieved. The accumulative structure coheres as fragments build toward this renunciation. Deduction for delayed orientation (carousel's nature unclear early) and some causality opacity around the ghost negotiations' mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the terminal transforms from abandonment to "arrivals that had never stopped happening," with visible cost in the rerouted systems and Mara's night of work. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from carnival departure through engineering interventions to living garden.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elian's shift from abandonment to reclamation, with visible cost in the "weight of one abandoned dream, heavier by the weight of one reclaimed." The accumulative lens holds as crystal imagery and silence motifs build toward the final incomplete measurement of absences. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. Deduction for the abrupt ending mid-sentence which, while potentially intentional, undermines full closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (sundial spinning backward, maps forming spiral) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara enters the architecture of lies she sought to understand. The closure lands with clear cost—cutting her tether to reality—and the final image of the sundial pointing forward reweights the entire journey. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the cartographer's statement, though the physical transformation compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Hara transforms from collector to teacher, with visible cost in accepting the fulgurite's "slow electricity" and commitment to "walk inland tomorrow." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the weavers' appearance feels slightly convenient. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the traveler accepts absence while transforming grief into "lonesome splendor" carried within. Cost is legible in "the part of herself that had waited on every dock" and the physical manifestation of blue flowers that "folded into seeds." The pattern of writing-as-resurrection coheres throughout with the thread as persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (frozen tear/palace, mechanical gardens, extinct egg) building to a Decisive Change where Halric transforms and resurrects color. The closure lands with clear cost: the palace falls, Halric becomes something inhuman ("wings of living flame"), and the waterfall ending implies his sister's death. The "flawed genesis" concept persistently shapes tactics through the artificers' failed preservation attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Mara's act of passing the coin and creating the sand birds - a transformation of trauma into gift. The accumulative structure coheres, building from personal wound to shared healing. Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and slightly abstract realization about compassion that weakens the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based progression (breadcrumb to breadcrumb, fountain to fountain) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where trapped memories are freed and the city transforms. The closure lands with visible cost—Elara gives up the box entirely ("pockets empty, heart full") and the geese's pause ends, marking irreversible change. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines, and the pattern of discovery-release-transformation holds consistently through seven fountains to the final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through gear rhythms, petal movements, and light inheritance culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where the sentimentalist's dissolution reweights the generational pattern. Cost is visible in her physical dispersal and the gear's final stillness, though the orientation (who/where/when) remains somewhat abstract throughout, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara transforms from isolated grief to communal practice. The butterfly migration patterns becoming carving guides creates causal linkage. Cost is visible in weeks of labor and the emotional price of releasing individual grief for collective healing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds toward Resonant Reconfiguration where absorbed forgiveness physically alters the pendulum's balance, enabling the clock's restoration. The cost manifests as Elara carrying others' guilt "folded inside her like extra weights." Clear orientation established early. The closure lands with both mechanical and emotional resolution as the obsidian "gave back a softer echo, as though the land itself approved."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora's choice of "Tomorrow" forecloses the path to her mother with visible cost ("knees creaking like old hinges"). The accumulative structure coheres through the tapestry's revelation sequence, building to a crystallized moment of choice between past forgiveness and future duty.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the partnership between cartographer and spire, with visible cost in the "spent nib" and transformed landscape. The accumulative/textural lens holds as frost equations build toward the final sustainable energy sigil, though the middle third could tighten causality between modeling and the spire's response.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the copyist transforms from passive preserver to active keeper of stories, with visible cost in her isolation and the weight of responsibility ("Keep them safe until ears grow hungry again"). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through dust-as-narrative motif. Slight weakness in the abrupt ending mid-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the mask's removal, but closure lacks visible cost—she "laid it reverently" without consequence. The orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.3 applied). The final image of "vanishing point accepted this too" provides resonance but no decisive change or reconfiguration with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist offering seeds despite the guard's hesitation, crystallizing the tension between old methods and new regime. The accumulative structure coheres as sedimentary layers build toward this moment of bridging past and future. Cost is visible in the protagonist's hoarse voice and the risk of confronting authority. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Ms. Vale offers the rosette to the student, transforming her relationship with hatred through the act of listening. The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered metaphors. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library setting unclear until later) and some causality softness in the middle transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as the greenhouse transforms from ruin to living brain, with clear cost in Marisol's offered memories and the city's impending bulldozing. The accumulative structure builds through taste-memory-action cycles that deepen with each beat. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by line 2, and the celestial alignment provides temporal pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through density increase and pattern transformation—from mechanical bees to luminous ones, from electrical tower to wonder-generator. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the tower's purpose shifts from power to poetry, with visible cost in the city's blackout-to-rebirth cycle. The riddle-to-realization sequence provides clear because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ritual of sanctifying objects that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where houses learn "how to breathe without breaking." Cost is legible through the widow's "grief from turning into haunting" and the noticer's transformation from observer to listener. The orris root shard left behind and empty pockets signal genuine sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the garden's renewal and descendants' return, showing clear before/after with emotional cost in their weeping recognition. The accumulative structure coheres through cascading revelations that reweight the abandonment as intentional hope. Orientation anchors clearly (underwater garden, Aurele, post-war timeframe).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the staircase transforms from prison to accepted reality, with the protagonist achieving Earned Stasis—continuing to walk but transformed. The mathematical proof sequence creates textural accumulation that pays off when equations literally crack reality. Cost is visible in accepting perpetual motion between "what was and what could have been."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the greenhouse transforms from solitary workspace to gathering place, with visible cost in the brush's dissolution. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the rapid multiplication of visitors in the final third strains plausibility slightly without sufficient buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from cultural death (silent hives, cold ovens) through Amara's arrival to communal restoration via bread-making. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the shared meal reactivates memory and song, with visible cost in burning the manuscripts. The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Marrow achieves his goal of unshackling fate's mechanism, with visible cost in his reversed memories and the hunger stone's destruction. The causal chain from clock-maker's disgust through yoyo manipulation to lighthouse transformation holds firmly. "He did not destroy the mechanism; he unclamped it" crystallizes the decisive change with the lighthouse now swaying drunk, its beam zigzagging—a new anarchic order replacing predictability.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator escapes the funhouse's loop, with visible cost (other reflections consumed, advisor trapped). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-teaching (mirrors, recursion, paradoxical notes) paying off in the escape. The "fear's weakness is the story that refuses to end where it began" lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from threat recognition through pattern-dubbing to the glass reef's transformation into marimba. The closure lands with visible cost (limes falling, creating music from danger) as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The lens holds consistently throughout. Minor deduction for slightly delayed spatial orientation of the floating orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the watchers dissolve into motes and pass through the opened gate, with visible cost in Neris's bleeding lips and the city's near-destruction. The accumulative pattern of cracks→sounds→meanings builds causally to this transformation. The unfinished final sentence ("closed behind them with a") creates intentional charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through manuscript fragment discovery, each revealing deeper deception until the pattern crystallizes. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's outward journey parallels the king's inward descent, with the blood drop charging the final image. Cost is felt through "Truth also wounds, but it heals cleaner than lies." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images of absence until the final resonant reconfiguration where Elara's inkwell now bears "a faint map of the pavilion's floor plan." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the inkwell's increased weight from "absorbed absences" and the pavilion as "a hollow organ still trying to sing." Each placed note and measured absence tightens toward this crystallized ending where memory becomes physical burden.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira reframes the library's purpose from historical record to "memory chamber before language split into rival histories." The cost is legible in her rejection of digital certainty for perpetual questioning. Accumulative structure coheres through compass rose motif building toward revelation. Minor orientation wobble with "drowned quarter" spatial logic but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora's grief transforms into future-oriented hope through the crane ritual, with visible cost in her year of mourning. The basilica's reality-bending properties and the dream-recording process create coherent pressure that builds to the final image of the hospital ward sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where she becomes "a perturbation, propagating outward." The geode's frequency broadcast and the final "I do" create legitimate cost and transformation. The piece teaches its lyric-scientific hybrid pattern early and maintains it. Slight deduction because the middle section's perturbation theory application could tighten the causal linkage between discovery and final action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "perpetually surprised by how complete a missing piece could feel" with visible cost (the pilgrim's sacrifice, branded wrist). The accumulative structure coheres around belonging/missing pieces. Deduction for slightly abstract cost presentation and the concept-heavy middle section that briefly loses embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's final act of releasing her truth transforms her relationship to memory-making, with visible cost in acknowledging "her silence had been a choice, not a necessity." The accumulative structure builds through physical discoveries that reweight her understanding, though the very final line is incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual repetition and symbolic weight until the cords snap—a Resonant Reconfiguration where both prisoners accept their past actions while choosing forward motion. The drawer pull's transformation from "warm brass" to "mirror-bright" physically manifests the exchange's completion, with visible cost in the "furrowed face" reflection and the lingering scents of "burnt cloth and wet ink."

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building toward the reunion. However, the fantastical reunion undermines causal credibility—the daughter's survival and presence aren't adequately grounded in the story's established reality. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (father accepts forward movement over backward regret) with emotional cost visible, but the magical realism element needed earlier teaching to fully earn its payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the protagonist accepting their role as rescuer rather than killer, with visible cost in "the past ran out of pages." The accumulative structure coheres well through recurring water/light imagery. Minor orientation wobble in the middle labyrinth sequence slightly dulls clarity but doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Ayla's transformation enables eternal guardianship with visible cost ("no longer entirely beast, no longer entirely whisperer"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image. The fortune's prophecy "What dies together must change together" pays off through enacted metamorphosis with clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mother accepts rather than reverses her loss, with visible cost in "the two prints overlapping like a promise that time, once lost, could still be found." The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery that reweights absence into presence. Orientation anchors (cartomancer, midnight glade, after birth) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lin's act transforms the ship from tomb to garden, with the cost being the dissolution of the sacred tear itself. The progression from floating through corridors to stitching photographs to opening the dimensional door follows accumulative logic, each image adding weight until the final transformation. Orientation anchors (Lin, ship, post-humanity context) establish clearly within opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara's understanding that "giving was not a subtraction but a translation" reweights all prior releases as transformative acts rather than losses, with cost visible in her permanent poverty ("never be rich again"). The accumulative structure builds density through each jar opening toward this crystallized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from blackout to revolution with clear closure - Lira completes her sabotage and returns to her post, having irrevocably changed the city's trajectory. The "lock is awake; gate is listening" pamphlet provides resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the revolution now underway). Who/where/when anchored immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's acceptance of perpetual seeking, with cost visible in the mother's permanent absence and the curse's persistence. The accumulative structure coheres as painted stones, star dust, and maternal promise converge in the final pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dust, drip, chrysalis, gradient of wings accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end (“Change … simply continuous”). Orientation is clear from the first line; the beat sequence coheres without causal gaps. Closure lands with felt cost—the relinquishment of spectacle and the elegy of decline. A slightly stronger final constraint or irreversible act could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the frost pattern method, kiln discovery, and turquoise-triggered projection build to a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with the realization to remember rather than avenge, with a conceptual cost. The final sentence truncation blunts cadence but the closure unit is already present. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the pattern of color-emotion intensifies through fork placement, prism-making, and culminates in a green chord that thaws frost and stirs the bird. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with a physical effect and a conceptual repricing (music for glass). Causality is clean and props are earned. The cost is implied (expenditure of emotion, relinquishing the last chord) rather than explicit, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: package → pier → descent → book → names → self‑inscription → lens shatters → lighthouse relights → collapse → return. Closure lands with cost on the page (the lens sacrificed, the library collapsing, his own name entered), and the end state reconfigures stakes for the village. Orientation is crisp from the first line, and scope stays within a focused single‑POV arc. Hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of quiet runs reweights when the star-marked seed crate appears, leading to a communal gathering and declarative reframing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (“tomorrow is already planted”), with the bell as ritual instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breath-to-image-to-touch intensifies toward a charged reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (viaduct, camera obscura, dusk), and the closure lands on page with cost (sorrow expelled; fracture sealed with “living gold”). Beats link coherently through objects and breath rather than plot mechanics. No dropped setups; the tear’s dissolution and return as liquid light satisfy the core drive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the retrocognitive garden to the dispersal ending. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes time’s texture and the world’s photographs cease fading. Cost is legible (loss of body/identity), and each image escalates toward that outcome without causal gaps. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early and consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: decode keys → find shaft → free cuff → retrieve seeds → guards breach → shoot beam → escape → plant. Orientation is immediate (abandoned redemption center beneath a falling wall), and the lens reads Causal with lyric accumulation. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: she forecloses safety to seed the future, paying the price of losing her last arrow and leaving shelter. The wall’s collapse and live breach provide on‑page cost that tightens choices.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned labor (collect–imprint–tile) densifies until the aurora flare reweights meaning with the hush realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: swapping “warning” for “witness” and leaving the aid behind. Orientation is clear early (sunken greenhouse, forge, hearing-aid designer) and the causal thread within the lyric structure remains legible. The persistent constraint (biological clock of cell division) charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned theft → jar heaviness → architectural “door” → renunciation and release. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (giving back her currency and craft’s power). Set‑ups (clock frozen, flower codes, moonbeams) all pay off without telegraphing. The decisive change is quiet but on‑page and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: awakening the room → discovering maps → committing to build a kiln and stay. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive intention, with the bookmark placed as placeholder for action, and the final image reweights “measurement vs. making.” Orientation is clear early. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, present but not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: shell → coordinates → reel → revelation → safe → roof key → confrontation → burning contracts. Closure lands on the page with cost (burning evidence, risking career and family mythology) and a decisive stance shift (“not to fall, but to fly on the truth”). Single POV and two shard-like moves within one location retain clarity. A touch of convenient magic (the shell’s guidance, micro‑grooves) leans stylized but holds under the piece’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of “silence-mapping” intensifies to the dot that spreads to black and the star’s extinguishing. Closure lands on the page with cost—she says “Go,” the last star dies, and the world enters absolute dark, reweighting all prior mapping. Orientation is clear from the opening and never slips. The price (end of light) is undeniable, and the final image is reconfigured by that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the loops pattern the pressure and culminate in an on-page reconfiguration: the amalgamation and exit from the loop. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the causal logic within the lyric frame holds. The cost is legible: not absolution but integration, carried forward in the fused violin. Expository reveals (“not rehabilitation—it was refinement”) skim close to telling, but they reinforce rather than replace the turning act.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (lens, tickets, crystal hush) build toward a resonant reconciliation. Closure lands on the page via the ledger’s red corrections and the mutual handling of the lens—an on‑page reconfiguration with conceptual cost (authority surrendered, trust reset). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and causal links (decode → invite → descend → ledger) hold. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the center puddles delivers earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual stories and polishing build toward the wisteria’s revival and the device’s fracture. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: “Gardens keep their own accounts,” the queen’s belief shifts, and the cracked marble’s burial sets a price. Orientation is clean from the opening. The cost is legible on-page (device breaks; a deception remains buried) without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the scene escalates from setup to Möbius corridor to collapse, culminating in a charged poise ending. Closure is on‑page with cost: proof attained, but at the price of reconfigured grief (brother’s name frozen in the nexus, dream‑songs threaded with her loss). Orientation is clean early; props and rules pay off. No causality breaches; the lever reset seals the breach with satisfying finality.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image patterns intensify toward a cadence shift where silence becomes performative code and the world reconfigures (flood recedes, program blank). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the line of ink and the single note reframing the legend. Orientation is clean early; continuity of space and props is tight. Cost is legible as surrender of the “trapped ghost” premise for a charged shared-breath poise.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images and actions build to a resonant reconfiguration where silence gains literal mass on the radiosonde scale. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when anchored by the station and dawn), and the closure lands on the page with cost. The tower ascent and sky test concentrate pressure before the decisive smudge and weighing. The final logbook entry and pocketing of the gentian mark an after/before.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the scanner, callers, and wheel build a pattern that reweights meaning, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate, and cause→effect remains legible: audio overlays prompt bead glow → numbers → Jonah’s voice → the soul‑weight turn. The ledger reveal and Mara’s release provide on‑page cost. The radio‑psychic mechanism is slightly contrived, but taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a taught pattern of descent → immersion in regenerative silence → return and inscription culminates in a quiet, charged cadence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to non‑judgment with visible cost in ongoing decay and aging, reweighted by the last “begin.” Orientation is strong from the outset, and the origami/obsidian mechanics are consistent. The cost is felt conceptually and atmospherically rather than dramatized as a high‑risk choice, keeping it shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑scene arc anchored early (who/where/when) with an accumulative/textural drive that tightens via the eclipse’s approach to totality. Closure lands on‑page with cost: Rowan speaks and Lila leaves the curl behind, reconfiguring the link between past/future. Because/therefore is gentle but present (music → shared melody → charged offering → words). Nothing vital is left offstage, and the cadence change at totality is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of listening/returning builds to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands on the page as Elara returns the stories, the tapestry dissolves, and she accepts a new role with cost (loss of her collector identity). Orientation is clean from the outset, and set‑ups (the tapestry, diaries, “bronze quiet,” last human dream) pay off. No causality breaks; the beat sequence coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: capsule → matched fortune → Mara’s demand → Lin’s burn → broadcast → public consequences. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration—shifting from secret dead-drops to open transmission—with on‑page risk and renunciation. The rapid, sweeping mainland effects flirt with convenience but read as fable‑consistent rather than plot amnesia. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the scene holds coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: layered silences, reversals, and the anchor’s tremor build to a conceptual reconfiguration where the demon unravels into letters that reinforce the lattice. Cost appears on the page (palette emptied; shimmer transferred), and the before/after is legible. A flaw: the final sentence truncates (“not by”), slightly marring the cadence of closure even though the decisive change occurred one beat earlier. Orientation is clear from the outset and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of mapped memory intensifies until the lake cracks and the horizon opens. Orientation is clean early (spire, lake, dawn), and closure lands with cost—she leaves the spire, expends herself, and passes the shell to her younger self. The decisive image of stepping onto the mirrored horizon and handing over the instrument is a resonant reconfiguration. No causality cheats; each beat grows logically from the mapping method.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative until a decisive causal act: density and patterning intensify, then the explicit choice to “surrender the thread” reconfigures options. Closure lands cleanly when she hurls the tablet and gravity returns; cost is legible as the loss of her retracing compulsion. Orientation is set early and holds through the surreal turns. No stray setups; the hospital floor recurrence and the runes fixing pay the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual assembly → hush entering → reversed images → teaching reprise. Orientation is clear early (cavern, Garrick, goal), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the cost of confronting grief (tears, backward memories) and leaving a “spent key.” The because/therefore chain is ritualistically soft but coherent; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational undertow; pressure thickens from being followed to the latch click to the stashing act. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses delayed disclosure and leaves the watcher a path, with conceptual cost on the page (“This is not concealment; it is delayed disclosure”). Orientation is clean early (courtyard at dusk, followed from the observatory), and causality is coherent. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible and tied to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on-page when he releases the drop, reconfiguring the premise—extinction becomes scent—and paying cost through relinquishment and identity shift. The sequence tightens through repeated UV surges and scent escalations, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the later shard reinforces the afterstate without reopening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the rope-layer investigation, hesitation, and retying build to a resonant reconfiguration: he offers the revised pattern, shifting from observer to agent. Cost is legible as a foreclosed stance—risking “the shape of tomorrow” to act—and the beings’ attention crystallizes consequence. Orientation is clean from the first lines; pattern is taught and paid off. Slight softness: world-scale stakes remain suggestive rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush is the field of pressure, harmonics accrue, and the cadence shifts when the bowl receives a seed and she commits to return as listener-conductor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (renouncing performance) and a reweighted world-rule (silence can be taught to sing). Anchors (who/where/when) are established early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: static → blotter absorption → swelling/dissolution → hand‑taking. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: “to feel truly with another is to lose the privilege of distance,” paid by relinquishing her practiced insulation. The grotto, blotter, and static provide a persistent constraint shaping tactics and final image. No orientation debt; causality is lyrical but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative cadence and causal links (misaddressed letter → search → pact → growing cycle → locket’s return). Orientation is clean from the opening; the montage of “nights” and “months” stays legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: compassion’s loop returns the lost locket with an emotional price. The clipped final sentence slightly blurs the cadence at the last beat, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds by arrival and contribution, culminating in “Now we are the tag,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). The closure is on-page and the price—relinquishing solitude and exposing one’s work to communal ownership—reads. Slight softness in causal tightening keeps it just short of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (pendant, canals, cadence) intensify toward the charged uncaging and final reconfiguration. Closure lands in a resonant repricing: the birthplace of echoes becomes portable in ink, with conceptual costs (stolen seconds, glimpsed empty city) on the page. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is legible through image‑driven steps. The cost is present though light, preventing an even higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions, image sequences, and small responses (the stalactite drop, the sap, the fern) accrete toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on page with cost—“I’ll keep the parentheses open” and stepping into the tunnel, after leaving the eyes. Orientation is clear early (cavern orchard at night; single POV; one scene), and the core stake tightens via the orchard’s response. Hairline: the clipped final “Behind” is an artifact but prior beat achieves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the outage’s “sapphire hush” deepens, the found fragment densifies the pattern, and the footsteps force a charged choice. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: Lira foregoes her plan to cache and instead places the tape under the floor to reach the teen, with a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the single scene tightens without drift. The final realization (“visibility travels in both directions”) is earned by the act, not stated in lieu of it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm’s density, the leaf’s change, and the power failure tighten until the dawn image reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she foregoes control as a tactic and reframes the leaf as compass. Orientation is clean early (nursery, trellis, storm season), and the sequence moves from study to surrender to a charged dawn. The turn is quiet but decisive; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: find brooch → stranger arrives → rain/tide pressure → exchange → reweighted final image. Closure is on the page with cost: surrendering the brooch to gain an earned stasis—sleep—and a reconfigured tomorrow. Orientation is clear from the outset (tidal island at dawn, post‑wars). The beetle’s final stir seals the before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive coheres: each image intensifies pressure toward a reconfiguration where “unseen forces” become ordinary choices with weight. Orientation is clean from the outset and the sequence—pearl to gate to corridor to song—lands closure on the page with conceptual cost. The final cadence (new crystal, ordinary light, shared exit) reads as a resonant repricing of the premise. Minor elision in world mechanics never breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: iterative acts with the valve build to the pendulum image that reweights sound/silence and absence/presence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when moonlight through the hung valve turns her path into notation. Cost is quiet but legible—loneliness, refusal of celebration, conservation amid scarcity—and informs the final stance. Slight softness remains in the truncated final sentence, but the closure image carries.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs accrue (arrows, punch, timetables) toward a central chamber reveal, and closure lands on‑page with cost: the confession dissolves into her palms, reweighting the quest. The world’s logic is taught by use (rails appear, punch opens gate) and coheres through to dawn. The corridor from dare → train → fortress reads as a single tightening stream. The price—renounced habits and the acceptance of a confession instead of an apology—anchors the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp within the opening lines (tower, cliff, whales, Mara, night). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: images and patterns intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration at dawn. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she re-commits to wonder and work, bearing cost via grief faced on the page. No causality breaks; the motif chain (tile → memories → mother’s date → promise) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coherent causal chain: curiosity → field realignment → shard fusion → threshold vision → amulet’s dissolution and re‑stabilization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “after goodbye” reweighted by the lantern hallway with cost implied in the near‑shred and the amulet’s sacrifice. Orientation is clean and the Hybrid lens with an accumulative finale holds. No unkept setups or convenience turns.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: director exits → Lila sets the con → director returns → she exploits the “breach” → the stamp lands. Closure lands on the page with cost in the stamp marrying “real and unreal” and her decision to vanish. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the persistent constraint (needing the director’s official seal) shapes tactics through the end. The dawn “pale ink” reweights the premise without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: sensory density builds toward a cadence shift when the lamp begins to forget, forcing an urgent, focused response. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “invented histories were not lies but lanterns,” with cost felt in the lamp’s fading and thicker silence. Orientation is swift and stable (Mount Qiyun bonsai pavilion; a single night’s vigil). The constraint (the lamp’s dwindling hum) shapes options and the ending’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tides, containers, and rumor‑fragments build pressure until the label breathes, the door opens, and the final identity shift lands. Orientation is firm early (port, containers, death certificate) and pays off at closure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (“Without a name to anchor me…”). Causal links within the lyric frame are credible and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual action (playing) compounds into revelation (copper heart, dusk‑star) and a Conceptual Repricing about memory as compass. Orientation is clean from the first line with a continuous scene. Cost lands on‑page (the shell’s destruction, blood, relinquished comfort) and reweights the premise. No causality breaks; the closure image is charged and final.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads primarily Causal: Lila reads signals, reconfigures the maze, and confronts incoming buyers; the sequence is coherent. However, the text truncates mid‑climax (“Confused, the lead negot...”), so the closure unit (DC/RR/CR) is not on the page and cost remains unproved. Orientation is clean and set‑ups (chip, Whale, graffiti) pay forward, but the decisive after/before reconfiguration is missing. Without an on‑page closing beat, the story’s final cost and consequence are unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive builds via a countdown and ritual prep to a charged final image. Orientation is crisp early; the capsule’s timing and the terminator’s kiss lock causality to the closing act. Closure lands on the page (violet flare/shutter) with a legible price (sacrifice of the grain, endurance against cold/time). The lens holds cleanly from setup through payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal spine: drone returns damaged → time pressure announced → diagnostic via water → patch → restart → projection → release. Orientation is crisp early (depot, shop, Orion), and the closure beat lands with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend as she sends the drone and resumes waiting. Cost is mostly opportunity/time rather than a concrete loss on the page, which softens the decisive feel. Still, the because/therefore chain holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring signals (condensation clock, falcon, ridge line) build to a resonant reconfiguration when the books melt a circle and the lake “answers” with a new current. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what she wants). Closure lands on the page with cost and a before/after: the outpost’s duty discharges as Lira activates the river’s first line. The cost is quiet but legible—she trades safety and retrieval for emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: footsteps → bell strike → arch strike → procession → ghosts → renunciation. Orientation is strong from the archway entry; pattern is taught early and paid off. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s pulse resumes and the tuner cedes control, with the arch “singing” and the bell ringing on its own. Cost is modest but present in his withdrawal and in the town’s reweighted boundary between living and dead.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative texture feeding a causal turn) is taught early and held. Orientation is swift (temple, dome, HUD clock), and the decisive act—relinquishing the mother’s memory—unlocks the altar with visible cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she chooses to preserve the surrender moment, reweighting the premise. No dropped set‑ups; the distress signal ceasing cements the bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation lands early (who/where/when and the lighthouse-prison), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through the descent and mirror-labyrinth. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the labyrinth collapses and the lattice becomes a ring, charging the final stance. Cost is legible on the page (the binding ring and the burden of carried hush). The beats progress coherently from door to door to mirrors to return, without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: nightly guardianship → approach to brightest fruit → bead pressed → soul transfer → forgiveness → dissolution → dawn. Closure lands on the page with cost (her vanishing) and world‑level reconfiguration (endless night breaks). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the hybrid causal/accumulative pattern holds. Minor softness in on‑page resistance prevents a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated night journeys, object recursion, and the spiral culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (stone boat, sealing labyrinth, water’s return). Costs register (time, surrender of the plate, labyrinth closing). Orientation is strong early, and causal links are legible via pattern intensification. The final sentence truncation (“planted the orchid seed in a”) slightly mars the closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: patterned images (serpent, roots, bones, light) accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when the sundial is restored and the village map surfaces, triggering a conceptual repricing of “interrupted journeys” with a felt cost (time spent, ethical intimacy with the dead, leaving the dial). Orientation is clean from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: preparation → hesitation → inscription → mailing → backward exit with a charged instruction. Orientation is clean early; the brass postbox’s “unfolding” sets a temporal gate that guides action. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: she mails and codifies her stance (“Read the cracks, not the words”), with conceptual cost. The only softness is the largely internalized pressure; external stakes remain quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from candle omen → decoding → restitching → beacon setup, culminating in a charged poise ending as dawn nears. Closure lands on the page: the chart placed beneath the lens so first light “would ignite the beacon and scatter the conspirators’ shadows,” with her endurance as the price. Orientation is clean early (observatory, candle, task), and no causality breaks occur. The persistent constraint (the eternal candle’s rule and the third moonset clock) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned ritual intensifies to a clear Decisive Change—she writes the apology in blood, the spirits echo it, the shard dissolves, and she chooses to stay. Orientation is clean from the start (Lira, mangrove labyrinth, night). Cost is on-page (blood, loss of talisman, surrender of old identity). Beats build coherently toward the final stance without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece deepens through the code, coral, and ritual to a charged poise. Orientation is early and clean; the single scene coheres. Closure lands with cost in the on‑page ask to plant the coral and the recognition of enduring injury. The final image reweights everything without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layering light and memory thins the fog until the decisive act—public display—reconfigures the world’s terms. Closure lands with cost: the cherub fades, the knowledge network dissolves, and the fog gathers at the edges (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend). Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and all setups pay off. The final image resettles the stakes: joy persists but must be continually re‑made at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the patterned soundwork intensifies into charged silence, reweighting the central question at closure. The Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she presses the nickel into the heart and chooses to leave, recoding her role from restorer to participant. Stakes and cost are legible in “offerings to whatever restorer would come next” and the felt absence of the coin. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure and meaning build through planted ciphers to the citywide exhale. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure mostly lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when “every garden exhaled the same sentence,” but the final line truncation blunts cadence and cost. The price remains conceptual rather than felt, diluting the ending’s decisive snap.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (postcard, shell, wind-lullabies) thicken toward a conceptual repricing—the treaty is between memory and forgetting. Closure lands on the page as he steps outside and feels the armistice “settle…like a seed,” with cost implied by relinquishing total vigilance. Orientation is taught early (who/where/what) and maintained. A minor text artifact (“He” fragment) follows a fully landed ending and does not collapse closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of the crack → failed repair with sap → need for original sound → retrieval and infusion of laughter → restoration and reweighted ending. Closure lands on-page with a visible/aural fix and a conceptual cost (the burden of names and her own unsaid one). Stakes tighten when the crack widens and the cylinder crumbles, forcing a new tactic. The hybrid lyric-causal design holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive leaning Causal: promises cause music; music draws Arden; his decision halts demolition; the shattering seals the shift. Closure is a Decisive Change (protection announced) plus a charged final image (“Listen”) with conceptual cost. The demolition crew’s pause and Arden’s rapid pivot feel convenient, trimming felt resistance. Still, the because/therefore chain holds and the ending lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causality is tight: cipher→amphitheater→measurement→lever→water’s murmur, with a clean cadence of activation and response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—gentle flow, slowed turbines implied, volcano at rest—anchored by her deliberate calibration. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, but legible. The final sentence fragment softens the cadence slightly without breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (dust motes, cages, papers, skylight) intensify to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost: she releases birds, loses the meteorite chip, and burns her paper proofs, choosing trust over reinvention. The letter functions as a decisive tightening that the ending pays off. The final charged poise (“attic both cathedral and grave,” returned pigeon minus chip) makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned acts (grain, code, thresholds) accrue until the maze opens and the reunion lands on the page. Closure is both Decisive Change (reunion and workshop revealed) and Resonant Reconfiguration (earned threshold). Cost is legible in the risked descent and the foreclosed wandering as the maze closes. Orientation is crisp from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each move (feather placement → fireflies → consoles → naming → memory reveal) deepens the stake toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives on the page with cost: the key object is spent (feather crumbles), sunrise ends the window, and she ascends carrying charged ash. Orientation is early and clean, and the cadence tightens near the dome reveal and final memory. The before/after is legible: outsider seeking versus belonging embodied as resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the three-seed sequence tightens meaning and cadence toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure is on-page and paid: the mirror/memory redefines “missing pieces,” and Lira forecloses the prior questing tactic. Orientation is clean from the first lines. The cost—relinquishing the hunt for corridors for the stewardship of feeling—registers within the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: each set‑up (gull/almonds, slopes, tide‑bus melody) pays off in micro‑causality, culminating in the halo, gifting of the bishop, and ripples into others’ futures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with Finch bowing to the pattern and exiting. The on‑page cost is conceptual—ego ceded to design—subtle but present. A minor textual glitch in the last word slightly scuffs the final cadence but not the closure logic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perception of gaps → reading marble → runes → fountains → sealing word forms a coherent escalation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: exile becomes “studio,” the garden and dancer mutually claim each other, with the cost of surrender/anchoring explicit. Orientation is clean from the opening; the mirrored and cracked pool set‑ups pay off. The ending’s decisive act (“Remember” across her throat) places the price on her own body, keeping closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds pattern and cadence toward a charged choice, then lands an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing as she installs and leaves the panes. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the timing tether (noctilucent clouds/“before everything shifted”) coheres through closure. Cost is legible on‑page: she sacrifices her flawed panes and accepts that the city will “forget the language of small flaws.” The closure image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ritual actions intensify meaning until the “forgive” and innocence‑repriced ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she forecloses a self‑punishing stance and accepts a charged stasis. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the scene remains continuous and coherent. The porcelain box’s open/close and the ridge’s seam image stitch structure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterative trials build to alignment, realization, and reconfiguration of the system (balloons begin returning; the gauge seeds a tree). Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the pattern is taught early then intensified. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (sacrificing the instrument, shifting from solitary launch to communal share). The pressure remains mostly conceptual, but the cadence shift at alignment and the final image deliver a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (abandoned observatory, ivy‑veiled passage, Mara’s role), and the causal chain is clean: diaries → coordinates on the negative → chamber → vision → choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the duty to remember and leaves a charged artifact/note. Cost is legible in the acceptance of burden and the sensed sorrow; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned acts (song, touch, cadence) build to a cadence break at the bell. Closure lands on page: the borrowed beat settles into her chest and the treaty with possibility ends as bells begin—an RR with DC undertones and a felt, conceptual cost (time window closes, “borrowed” becomes owned). Orientation and causal cohesion are clean, with the locket constraint shaping tactics. The cost is understated but legible through the deadline and the surrender of “borrowedness.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual steps and tokens build to a charged poise as Kelis completes the circle and the clipboard absorbs the cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening terrace image. Closure lands on the page with felt price (enduring silence, surrendering tokens, accepting incomplete forgiveness) and a reweighted stance (“planting ideals not as banners but as seeds”). The causal thread is ritual-bound rather than plot-turn based, but coherent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hybrid drive: accumulative lyric density with clear causal triggers (egg → note → ground’s harmonic → water returns). Closure is decisive and on‑page: she chooses not to command the orbital array, ending her drought scheme. Cost is explicit and tied to prior setup, with the final image reweighted by that loss. Orientation is clean early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from tracing one thread to releasing all, shattering the dome, and condensing into a heart-sized prism that she implants—a clear RR/CR with on-page cost. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the causal sequence is coherent. The price is legible in “weight of every echo” and the sanctuary’s destruction, reconfiguring the world and her body.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when set early) and the accumulative lens is consistent. Escalation proceeds through performance beats (tyrant claim → reversal → child’s intervention → confession → audience participation). However, the ending truncates mid‑action and denies a clear closure unit with on‑page cost. The conceptual turn toward shared authorship is promising but not sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions layer toward a Charged Poise closure (the knot loosens, the tower becomes an invitation, the thread tugs then slackens). Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when). Cost is legible: she binds herself to the testimony, then must leave it to be forgotten on its own cycle. Persistent constraints (gravity, drifting vines, the “last” migration clock) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and ritual steps toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the wax tablet’s imprint and glowing footprints—a before/after that repurposes war‑casting into name‑keeping with cost acknowledged. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The sequence is legible with a single scene and one deepening turn (rope resonates → names released → imprint secured).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure thickens: storm intensifies, directive “hungry” to be rewritten, dreams stacked into a rope, then the decisive step through the living arch. Closure lands with cost (identity shedding, bunker swallowed) and a clear before/after. Orientation is clean from the outset (bunker, storm, AI voice) and the pattern taught is paid off in the final signature. The prophecy reinterpretation (interpreter → message) reconfigures the premise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: tile permutations → mapped palace → hidden chamber → covenant and renunciation. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the closure lands on-page with cost (“surrender his star-charts... portion of every future night”). The causal lens holds through to the final image of the Crooked Staff; no reliance on coincidence to resolve. The fused tile and settled palace create a decisive change and persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern “While reality shifted” teaches the design early and pays off as cadence and pressure. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: Lira ages in the hush, her final breath stored, after transforming battlefield to garden. Causality coheres through motifs (pin, lullaby, sanctuary) rather than plot gymnastics, and cost is on the page. Orientation is clear from the opening and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through ritual, image density, and object transformation toward a reweighted end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she renounces trapping and becomes a door‑maker, with the sextant recalibrated to forgiveness. Orientation is crisp early; the recurring ritual and moth guide progression without causal gaps. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, legible but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: climbing → mending → memory fruit → reunion → vows released → communal thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vow‑song and ribbon linking reweight the breach into “sweet rot” with a felt cost (memories surrendered). Orientation is crisp from the outset (cathedral‑orchard, who/why). No causality slips; each image earns the next and narrows options toward the silent duet.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and pressure recur and intensify (orchard/bathroom/shell), culminating in an on‑page cost (“Her memories began to peel away like petals”). Orientation is swiftly taught and the surreal rules stay consistent (bathroom as method, doors, seed). Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes guardian, foreclosing other futures. The price persists into the final image (dimmed orchard now hers to tend).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: portal arrival → deciphering → negotiation → transformation → renunciation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (staying to tend the living library), clearly on the page. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality breaks. The negotiation-to-seed pivot and portal’s ticking pressure bind the arc tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: density of images escalates toward a decisive act (choosing “Go,” exhaling the chord) with cost. Setups pay off (thread → trapdoor → engine room; aberrant chord → exhalation), and the closure is legible as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration. Slight ding: the final line truncation blurs the last cadence, softening the closure image even though the choice lands beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with Accumulative dominant: patterned actions (rebraiding, cadence shifts) culminate in a reweighted world-image and open the door. Causal links are clean (rope adjustment → clock cadence shift → door opens → treaty revealed), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Cost is conceptual rather than personal; the protective enchantment lifts and the campus world subtly reconfigures. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the single transition to the scriptorium is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds, with a meaningful turn when she releases the stone and seeds the rivulet. However, the story cuts off mid‑final act (“She set it afloat, and it”), so closure doesn’t land on the page and cost remains implied rather than sealed. Orientation is strong; causality threads are consistent. The missing ending blocks a fully earned RR/CR cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: patterned images and procedural steps cohere into a closure beat where the prism mends and the network rekindles. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). The closure lands on the page with cost—silence threat, relinquishing the shard, and a conceptual repricing of “coincidence”—without mechanical over‑explanation. Causal steps (align, rotate, trace) interlock with the pavilion’s song to deliver a decisive change and a reweighted premise.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterning of rain/shadow/whisper escalates to the obelisk’s void and the tactile act of fusing page to stone, yielding a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean early; the thirty-three-stone measure to thirty-three years lands as a motivated link. Closure is on-page: the archive’s method reweighted and the fog cracking as consequence. The final fragment line is a slight artifact, but the closure effect precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: chant → mosaic lock → ignition → ember footprints → cannon bouquet → stars → altered mosaic. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress’s rule reweights (“Hope is a fuse…”) and the world changes (new stars; travelers relieved), with a conceptual price—she commits her key object and accepts future duty. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and patterning is taught early and paid off. Pressure is gentle but coheres; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, when, and aim), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through to closure. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: they accept a new stance shaped by the cicada’s visions and the tide’s resumed breath, with the cost of acknowledging maternal silence. The tide’s inhale and the decision to return the cicada crystallize the before/after. Causality is lyrical but coherent: the object triggers the revelation that reweights the sibling conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silences accrue, reweighted at closure when the doll becomes a bridge and the father a “gardener of hush.” Orientation is crisp from the outset (bunker, inversion hour, trellis). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she foregoes the object as a tether and redefines silence as agency, carried back into drills. A live clock (“the hour is almost gone”) provides tightening without breaking the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush thickens through measured attention until the sigh catalyzes a luminous re-weighting. Orientation is clean from the outset (canal, terrace, whistle) and the single-scene window is disciplined. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: grief metabolized into earned quiet; the vial’s still sphere and “the silence knows your name” seal the before/after. Cost is emotional and present, if gentle, not mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: images accrue (murals → staircase → throne) with causal steps that narrow options under a live clock. Closure lands on the page when she sits and the orchard seals—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend with drones arriving too late. Cost is legible as the acceptance of custodianship against a culture of amnesia. Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (ruby flake, murals, sunrise) pay off without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shadows’ encroachment, threshold fading, and the ring’s transformation build to a clear repricing—sanctuary becomes process, absence becomes potential. Orientation is established quickly and maintained. Closure lands on the page with cost: she relinquishes the sanctuary and carries scars forward. The because/therefore chain is lyric rather than causal, yet the cadence shift at the end is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean and causal within a lyric frame: glitch texts → coordinates → elevator descent → corridor keying → acceptance of pressure → diamond. Closure lands on the page with cost via a resonant reconfiguration: regret is compressed into clarity and she renounces greed. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph (who/where/when). The hybrid lens leans accumulative at the end, and the throughline holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: crank → confession → identity reversal → chosen non‑violent ending at the foundation stone. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act (pressing the handle “like a seed” and speaking her name), and the price—relinquishing her defined role and the blood solution—is felt. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words, and the gramophone/handle constraints carry through to the end. The coordinates inside the handle provide an elegant because/therefore connective tissue into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent because/therefore progression toward a decisive crossing. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: merging with the puppet, grafting cords, and stepping into “branching dawns.” Cost is legible (loss of withdrawal, physical/ontological grafting). The lens reads dominantly accumulative with causal turns; all set‑ups (orchard, scroll, oath) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: button → folder/Polaroid → vow/support‑group plan → forgiveness creates a coherent deepening toward a charged poise. Closure lands in the on‑page forgiveness and reframing of what she will tell—cost is the relinquishment of grievance. The final sentence truncation blunts the cadence of the last image, but closure has already occurred. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece coheres from reconnaissance (puddle map) to infiltration (drones, reeds) to broadcast and a charged exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she commits to returning, with risk and endurance as price. Causality is clean and props pay off (key, booth, lagoon conductivity); orientation is solid from the opening image. The only softness is a relatively frictionless broadcast, which slightly mutes peak-turn pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine: radio code → grotto’s amplifying danger → choice to whisper silence. Orientation is quick and clean; the pattern of silence-as-action is taught and paid off. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he forecloses the path of performance and reweights music as absence, with the grotto dissolving. The cost and before/after are legible in the final image and his ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: falling leaves/runes intensify toward the last‑leaf cadence shift. Closure lands decisively on the page with cost (body dissolves; guardianship/exile accepted). Setups (folklore, moonstone, choreography) pay off causally at the summit. Orientation is clear from the outset and sustains coherence through the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coincidence thickens into pattern (11:17), threshold (greenhouse) to descent (lake) to repriced return (“Perhaps” clock). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he abandons conventional time/north to calibrate lives to private waterfalls and keep the greenhouse unlatched. Beats link coherently—compass tugs down, lake parts, twin roses fuse—without breaking causality within the fable’s rules. The final spinning needle and chosen poise underwrite the before/after decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single‑scene causal chain holds: coin state → ritual steps → furnace reignition → crucible sealing → vial as inheritance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she revalues the name and its weight, with the cost of accepting the irrevocable loss of her mother. The lens reads Hybrid with accumulative lyric texture culminating in a concrete causal payoff. Final image (vial beside her heart, ballast) clearly marks before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric build on a causal spine: tooth vibrates → side cave musician → wind aperture note → release of sins → tooth memory → tuned laughter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gorge retuned, vials emptied, the tooth transformed, and she breaks her silence (“Thank you for the song”). Cost is legible: relinquishing her stored confessions and the guarded silence she kept for a century. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the throughline never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile metrics (pressure, steps, numbers) accrue into a rule‑set the scene then exploits. Closure lands on the page with cost via the strap’s release and burial, plus the conceptual repricing (“integration” over “subtraction”). Early anchors (who/where/when) are clean, and the “seventeen” tightening provides the key reversal before the spiral solution. The persistent constraint (strap) shapes tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density tightens toward the costed exchange and the decision to carry the story back. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she accepts the role and pays in memory—then reaffirms it by raising the fragment. The final sentence truncation slightly blurs the parting image, softening impact. Orientation is clean from the first lines (market, catwalks, role) through the portal and return.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: image density tightens (frost LOOK → dust spirals → pulsing ceiling → mirror shaft) to a decisive act (seating the mainspring) that reconfigures the world. Closure lands on‑page with cost: ghosts’ dismissal, the heirloom surrendered, and her future path reweighted. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when). The beats link coherently without convenience or retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bottle/action densifies pressure until the system fractures. Closure is on‑page with cost—the library dissolves, the operator becomes a word, and the perfect taxonomy is unmade. Causal motifs are clean (Farewell disrupts patterns; Remember reverses the press; uncorking all triggers collapse) and payoffs align with the taught logic. The final image reconfigures options and price without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and acts accrue toward a reconfiguration from ownership to stewardship. Closure lands on page as Mara hands over the healed vase and they covenants as stewards; the cost is relinquishing claim and facing her betrayals. Orientation is clear and the pattern is taught early (mirrors/time; shard/stories). The Company’s enforcers yielding so readily trims felt resistance at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: chip test → singing → rust loosens/fights back → vow rekindles power → confrontation → fusion → balanced hour. Orientation is swift and stable; the piece holds a causal/lyric hybrid with causal dominance through closure. Closure lands decisively with the fused gear and citywide release, carrying conceptual cost (compromise of absolute dawn). No teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from descent to membrane, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she declines to cross, sends the compass upward, and emerges altered. Orientation is clean from the opening: factory shutdown, sub‑basements, freight elevator, lagoon. The cost is on‑page (foregoing myth, surrendering the compass, “lungs aching”) and reweights prior material. Causality is lyrical but consistent—each because/therefore flows from the compass reading to the membrane test.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative lens: the slide’s projections, the collaborative rebuilding, and the seasonal arrivals build to a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the storm-tossed archway to the marsh and lantern; the magical logic remains consistent. Closure lands on “the alliances were not chains but spirals,” with cost registered in Older Mara’s dissolution and the mantle passed. No major causality gaps; the loop motif informs progression rather than flattening it.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal returns, craft advances, and a pattern break (no candle) lead to closure where pigment and petal synchronize. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reprices the question and paints the threshold, imposing a lasting consequence on others. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and sustained despite temporal elision. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of her investigative drive and the reorientation of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ritual act deepens pressure until the cipher opens and the names are spoken. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the diary dissolves, the names enter the water, and Elara’s role shifts from seeker to witness-bearer, with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clean early (zeppelin library above hidden lagoon), and the magical logic remains coherent. The chain from parley to opening to naming reads motivated and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: last wish → conceptual pivot → blueprint spoken → ritual renunciation → departure with a lantern rising. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he rejects magical ease in favor of conceived labor, with felt cost in leaving props and wishes behind. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; causality is coherent through motif recurrence. Cost is subtle rather than stark, but it’s legible and charged in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural holding through closure. Orientation is immediate; beats cohere from silence → listening → accidental prophecy → reprice vow → new oath → charged image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (cracked cylinder; surrender of archival remove). Causal threads (voice via memory, orchard dictation) are legible without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through the ritual: cold harnessed, seeds align, hum rises, vortex opens, membrane thins. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she withdraws and reseals, reconfiguring the meaning of inheritance with a felt price. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causality breaks. The final stowage of the cap ties the action to a new steady state.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative dominant: ritual pressure builds to zero hour, causal pull-begets-vortex, then a resonant reconfiguration as he accepts the rope and charge. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and set-ups (zero hour, rope, instruments) pay off cleanly. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a legible before/after and a soft but real cost. No causality breaks or dangling set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: patterned attention and ritual actions densify until the cadence breaks at “he opened the vault of his chest.” Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: station revived, time rewound, and a final offering that reweights the premise. Cost is legible in admitting the void and letting it equalize him. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → interpretation → confession → ritual reading → vow. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (box locks like a wingbeat; he accepts stewardship) and an earned stasis with cost (self‑exile, burden of weight). Orientation is crisp; props and images pay off. The slight trailing final phrase is a cosmetic slip but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held; density and patterning escalate toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean: who/where/aim established in the opening. Closure lands when she accepts a skin-read compass and meets “the woman who remembers tomorrow,” a reconfiguration with felt cost. Setups (airplane, shard) pay off without convenience or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition and motif intensify toward a charged poise/CR at the end. Closure lands on the page—“the string inside her chest snap…not breaking but unbinding” and stepping into widening space—repricing loss as release. Orientation is clean from the first line; single scene coherence is maintained. Cost is legible via erasure (word, shells, footprints) and acceptance of the “endless loom.”

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned work, discoveries, and installations crescendo to the charged final image. Closure lands with cost—the moonflowers opening at her last breath and the diary seeded for the next keeper (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Each “architectural secret” reweights options and tactics, cohering causally within the lyric frame. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ascent → orchid insight → statue/mirror → amber activation → tower’s response → convergence/wings. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: her identity is reweighted and the tower/world answers. The last line truncation (“above”) nicks the landing slightly, though the decisive change has occurred just prior. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: patterned sowing/chanting intensifies toward the heron’s circle and the last seed at the tide line. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration as the battlefield blooms and the tide carries “forgotten songs.” Cost is legible in the use of the final pod and the relinquishment of grief’s stasis. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first hush through the cylinder’s activation to the charged final stillness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dog accepts listening as translation, not walking, with the settlement “smaller” and options reweighted; the cost is the renunciation of former searching and its attendant grief. Orientation is clear early and maintained. The cylinder/leaf pattern pays off causally and texturally without explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain holds: return to deck → anomalous sky → compass alignment → glimpse of Lys → choice not to cross → sketching-as-bridge → field contracts. Orientation is swift and firm (03:17, emergency seal, observation deck), and the single-scene window is respected. Closure lands on-page with cost (refusal to cross; risk confronted), delivering a decisive change and reconfiguring identity. The compass’s function is taught through action rather than late rule-drops.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. The swap → spire shudder → realization about price → pouring the dawn → leaping forms a tight because/therefore sequence with a clear on‑page Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and clean; the closing image pays the setup with cost (surrendering secrecy/fear) and consequence (sky amended, apprenticeship gained). Stakes remain slightly abstract but are enacted through concrete moves.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens through patterned movement and ritual responses until the ending’s Earned Stasis/Charged Poise lands (“STAY”). Orientation is clean from the outset (interregnum, whispering gallery, crisis actor). The chessboard ritual and gallery’s replies escalate toward a reconfigured role with conceptual cost (self‑amputation of nostalgia). The closure is on‑page, with the final stasis charged by responsibility and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions (stone → feather → ink → maps → tree → word) deepen pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration where the mountain becomes home. Cost is legible (each old‑tongue word resurrects the forgotten; remembering hurts), and the decisive act (“She spoke the first word…”) lands. A textual flaw—truncated final line—blunts the cadence of closure even though the core transformation precedes it. Causality remains coherent within the lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Hybrid lens with an accumulative dominance, the piece escalates by image and cadence toward a clean RR/Earned Stasis. Orientation is crisp from the opening and all beats cohere causally (entrance → decoding → chair → release → rain). Cost is legible at closure: he relinquishes the punitive posture that defined his exile, accepts a draw, and risks saying her name. The final environmental shift (first raindrop) seals the before/after without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: a Resonant Reconfiguration with Conceptual Repricing as the towers bloom and the ritual is supplanted. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the sequence escalates from approach to reading to guards to transformation. Cost is legible (risk of exile, structural cracking of the spire) but the resistance dissolves quickly when the guards lower weapons, softening the decisive pressure. Still, the ending reweights the world’s rule‑set on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: narration → alignment → animation → dissolution → renewed vow, with a clear cadence shift at the statue’s awakening and sacrifice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the statue is gone; the narrator inherits perpetual duty. Orientation is early and clean; magical mechanics stay consistent enough to support the turn. A faint whiff of convenience in the rapid repair → reversal is offset by established rules and the stated “if the story ends…” constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and pressures layer toward a resonant reconfiguration at the lagoon. Orientation is clean from the quay to the cave; one transition, single POV, and a clear before/after. Closure cost is on-page: relinquishing the captured dawn and accepting the mirror’s scar. The final reweighting (painting the space between heartbeats) coheres with prior motifs without explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (tremor as intent; scent as conduit) and intensifies to an on‑page reconfiguration. Closure arrives with the screamed tenderness that transforms the light’s function from warning to welcome, with cost and a distinct before/after. Orientation is clear from the outset and maintained. The causal links are lyrical but coherent and sufficient for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the midnight calls and lunar pulses build a coherent pattern that culminates in a clear on‑page crossing with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (navigator at the signal station post-failure), and set-ups (dish, censer foot, calls) pay off. Closure is a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration as she crosses and receives the bronze “cool, steady.” No causal breaks; the constraint of moon‑linked heat shapes tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning causal: Kestrel hires her → glass eye triggers an involuntary confession → cave/cures/world rule → storm pressure → planting the eye decisively changes stakes. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after: compulsion eases, roots tighten, and she commits to remain caretaker. Cost is implicit in the renunciation of market anonymity and in maintaining “psychological safety.” Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: attention → observation of gaps → memory transfer → vow. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he chooses to bear the memories, pins the Edelweiss, writes, and promises, with the cost legible in the wilting petals. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The final image reweights isolation into stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene, Situational drive holds: rising storm + time‑bound midsummer bloom + mirror choice cohere to force stance crystallization. Closure is Earned Stasis: he refuses to step through; the cavern seals, options foreclosed on the page. Cost is legible in the forfeited chance to unmake Lila’s choice and his own past. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres through patterned images (lace, ember, bleeding starlight) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single scene escalates cleanly to the grotto ritual and the sky’s repair. Closure lands on the page with cost—she reprices the crown and ambition, and releases the firefly. A hair shy of 9 because the external world‑ending threat resolves swiftly once the method is invoked, making the cost feel primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density and cadence to a clean Conceptual Repricing: abandon bottling to choose presence. The cost is visible when she crushes “the last pocket‑sun,” and the world reconfigures as the lattice forms and refolds into the curl. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the pattern is taught and paid off. The ending’s charged poise—curl in Cael’s pocket, ordinary night turned charged—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens from cabin → flight → selves → burning → return, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the decisive shift—burning the scroll—reprices the premise. The gravestone and jealousy constraints carry through to the ending where they are reweighted as “patient and irrelevant.” The final clipped sentence mars cadence slightly, softening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (fog, occlusion, touch, water clock, screw) thicken toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when the screw is placed, the clock’s pulse starts, and Elara “hears” cedar—her stance toward sense and self is reweighted with the cost that smell remains lost. Orientation is clean early; single scene, single POV, and one dominant stake are respected. The final beat earns its cadence without an explain‑everything wrap.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained; pressure coheres around the held breath and rune‑making. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration on the page: scars become a book, the rock rises, rain arrives—paid for by lung‑burning endurance and risk of plummet. Orientation is clean and the causal chain is consistent within the story’s rules. The cost is legible at the ending beat (“lungs burned,” “molten glass inside her ribs”).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the live clock of the pending chainsaws tightens the frame. The accumulative design coheres: perfume → pipe → fluttering scores → ghost → apple-seed rest → saws, culminating in a charged poise closure. Cost is legible on the page: the orchard still falls; she surrenders the bottle and accepts a transformed, not reversed, loss. Setups (requiem, currents, orchard site of the prior rite) all pay off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs intensify (spiral, dictionary, hush), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when she swallows the dot and becomes the “librarian of the beginning.” Orientation is taught early and remains legible within the lyric design. Cost is on the page—the surrender of separateness and role—paid through a specific act. The pattern escalates coherently toward a final reweighting of meaning with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning (counting backward, fjord quiet, key/pendulum) tightens into a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (clock left thirteen seconds slow; chosen silence). Orientation is firm from the opening and pays off in the precise end image. The decisive alteration of the clock’s pace and the refusal to justify it create a before/after that is legible and costly. The closure’s charged poise is clean and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern awareness (currents, permeability, laser lattice) densifies to a resonant reconfiguration where walls become lungs. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure lands with cost—the grief diffused, the stranger gone, the offering made. Because/therefore linkages are soft but coherent within the lyric frame (test → breach → lattice → inhalation → offering). The price is legible on the page without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early through a patterned hunt for messages and held to the roof, where the pattern breaks into a charged image. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the house becomes time; she reorients her pedagogy and love toward risk with an Earned Stasis refusal. Cost is legible in soaked vulnerability and in accepting limits (“without betting her heart”). Orientation is clean; no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterned loop and the wrong-number cadence intensify toward the decisive reconfiguration where Mara becomes infrastructure. Orientation is clean early (tunnel, booth, switchboard), and escalation tracks: loop → callers hear it → Lila crisis → shattering and seeding. Closure lands on the page with cost and a reweighted world-rule (“every terminus is a disguised origin”). The amended ledger note extends the closure without reopening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of detail tightens to a cadence shift as the jetty dissolves and the locket reconfigures the contract into pigment/paper. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the covenant preserved through her text at the price of partial self-translation. Orientation is clean from the outset (archivist at the blooming jetty at twilight). No causality breaks; the whispered terms and mother’s precedent shape the end.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the rumor’s rules, scale reading “Enough,” rail hum, sparrows’ map, and list of handlers build to a Charged Poise ending. Closure lands with cost as the clock advances to 11:48 and the warm cavity replaces the stone. Orientation is crisp from the opening station image, and the because/therefore chain is lyrically coherent. The price—sending the stone away and accepting an open-ended return—registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing when she offers “grief” and reframes the quest—mapping herself with a visible cost (identity shift, acceptance of pain). The scene holds a coherent single window with one decisive tightening (melody densifies → stillpoint → naming). Orientation is clean and the causal thread within the lyric logic remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the edits accrue ripples and costs, culminating in a charged reconfiguration when she writes the witness sentence and the nib breaks. Orientation is clear from the outset (who, where, what’s at stake), and the pattern is taught then paid off. Cost is legible on the page (pen sacrificed; mercy becomes justice; grief widens). The final cadence settles into an earned stasis charged by acceptance rather than dominion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the scene coheres: ritual → intensification of signing → immersion → resurfacing and departure, with the harbor’s answering hush as the cadence shift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: an earned stasis/charged poise where he accepts anonymity and carries the music forward. Cost is legible on the page (“Listen when I am gone,” footprints fading, no look back). Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: art accrues into a legible ritual pathway (murals → mirrors → key → tapestry) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset and the magical logic is consistent. Closure lands on the page with cost when she surrenders selfhood to keep the promise. A single decisive tightening (the mirror that refuses pigment) effectively pivots the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rhythmic interaction with the garden/lagoon builds to a cadence shift at the offer, then to the integrating act and dispersal. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns borrowed memories, keeps her own, and accepts ongoing institutional pressure. The cost is legible in the final image (“next dose,” rebellion hidden), and prior beats set it up. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned cues (storm interference, coin pulses, map key, whisper) tighten toward the mic test and citywide echo. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when) and causality holds: old map → key sigil → hidden door → pace challenge → mic. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—distance is redefined—but the on‑page cost is gentle, more wonder than loss, which limits the ceiling. No teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned openings → braiding → vortex/pearl → soothed canal, a clear tightening and cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: darkness “learns,” water is “no longer hungry,” the mirror is left reflecting morning—conceptual cost born of the guardian’s vow and the unrescued child. Orientation is clean from the cobalt dock and canal through to the final image. The chain of ritual steps reads coherent and necessary without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: library whisper → grotto insight → town‑wide displays → twilight resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the town’s quiet is reweighted and Mara commits to ongoing rebellion. Causality is lyrical but traceable; the only softness is the near‑absence of on‑page cost or resistance. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the motif payoffs are kept.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: scrimshaw warms → call → island reveals → choice deadline → decision to detach. Closure lands as Decisive Change with cost: she leaves the harbor life, witnessed by “past tense” talk and vanished charts. Hybrid drive leans causal at the end, with the sunrise clock tightening options. The slightly truncated last phrase doesn’t break closure but nicks the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterned narration and object use build to a resonant reconfiguration when the heart is given and tears finally arrive. Cost is on the page (quiet tears under a regime that forbids sorrow; the performer leaves carrying an echo of grief). Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. The final line truncation (“The performer disappeared into the”) is a minor artifact that slightly scuffs the cadence but closure lands earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of boundary‑play intensifies (paraphrase → entry → membrane wrap → walking water) to a charged final image. Closure is a conceptual repricing—“the echo is already home” reframes the ban and symmetry at cost of the old order. Causal links are clear within the lyric logic (her paraphrase triggers the colonnade’s response; notebook inscription reweights rules). The cost is more metaphysical than material but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: offer → trade → arrangement → note → reconfigured practice → charged final object. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she barters another awakening and embraces a path that will demand more). Orientation is clear early (courtyard at dawn, phoenix, kiln; who/where/when). No causality breaks; the phoenix reprise ties the pattern at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and resonance build via jars → refracting → fork → singing → full release, culminating in a role shift from pilgrim to sanctuary (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Closure is on-page with a conceptual cost (renouncing departure), but the final sentence truncation (“smiles at the way the”) hurts cadence and slightly blurs the last beat. Orientation is solid early, and causality at a textural level remains coherent. The cost is more implied than viscerally felt, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions (cranes, lenses, curtains) densify until the garden overlaps the observatory, then reprice grief. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: planting the locket and adopting “gardener of the possible,” with the caretaker’s winding‑down as cost. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and sustained. Cause comes via ritual sequences rather than plot turns, but the cadence shift at the map/garden manifestation is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images build toward a Conceptual Repricing as she realizes value has migrated into gestures and mutual aid. Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and the scene coheres in one continuous window. Closure occurs on‑page with cost: she accepts the crash of maps themselves, leaves the spiral as a compass, and descends to “confide the new coordinates.” The measuring tape and rain function as persistent constraints charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal backbone: arrival → core contact → resonance song → collapse → retrieval of the original prism. Orientation is clean from the first line; the taught pattern of the archive’s traps pays off in the collapse spiral. Closure lands with cost: she lifts the original prism and the pagoda crumbles—an earned decisive change. No causality breaks or soft resets; the beats tighten logically.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: shadow appears → archival comparison → realization of metamorphosis → anchoring act with names and stone → reversal. Closure lands on the page with cost (shadow bound, not destroyed; duty reweighted). The single scene holds time, space, and logic; the river‑stone mechanism is pre‑seeded and paid off. Lens: Causal with a resonant final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: the ritual of reconstruction tightens toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and causality holds as work begets realization and decision. Closure lands: she commits to report while shielding the chameleons, with the cost of vigilance and loss acknowledged. The cadence shift at dawn seals the before/after without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs accrue (plants, rings, hourglass, dawn) and culminate in an on‑page release where cost is legible. Orientation is clean by ~120 words: who, where, when, and the wound are clear. The decisive act (pressing shard to scar) effects a resonant reconfiguration: telepathy ends and the miracle departs. Because/therefore linkages (rings → memory → balcony ritual) hold without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density tightens into the letter’s manifestation and the conceptual pivot that love lives “in the interval between frames.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing coupled with Earned Stasis (she plants the quartz and chooses a new stance). Cost is legible in relinquishing the letter’s old function and the path toward Lin. Orientation is clean from the opening and all set-ups (tin, dead bulb, quartz) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density and cadence tighten from observation to ritual to declaration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: “I will carry the unwritten…” reframes the work, the archway sighs, and the snowfall of words signals a before/after. Orientation is clean early (dreamer, aurora, archway, sextant) and maintained. The causal mesh is lyric but coherent: rising auroral pressure → instrument flash → stardust as script → decision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs tighten toward the decisive act with the clock and spark. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—he chooses to seed forests of lullabies, reweighting preservation from ledger to living sparks, with on‑page cost (archive narrows and folds, memory gift with loss). Orientation is taught early and consistent; corridor transition is legible. The final fragment (“When the last ember lands”) slightly mars cadence, though closure already reads prior.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural structure tightens coherently from awakening → delusion path → “unravel” → gear insertion → repricing of the forest. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing with cost: she surrenders name, regrets, and the map, and does not return. Orientation is early and steady despite the surrealism. Recurring constraints (gear/orchid, rainforest’s humidity and sorting) shape the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions and images intensify toward the bell‑stone and the naming of fear. Closure is on‑page with cost: the boy names “Stay,” accepts a binding thread, and walks on, foreclosing his prior tether. Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. The price is emotional and conceptual, not dramatic, but it’s undeniable within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clear causal chain: discovery of the bolt → message → repricing of the fortress’s rule → decisive opening of the gate with visible cost. Orientation is clean within the first lines, and the piece holds a single POV and scene window. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with the fortress cracking and the protagonist leaving. The cost (loss of safety and identity‑role) is explicit in the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence is coherent—clues → confrontation with the mark → activation of the rune → systemic correction—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the ending’s before/after is legible. The price is more elegiac than harrowing, but it’s on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned taps → coordinates → unsounded slick → descent → loom/sextant → restored lane → re-anchored station. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (paths folded, restoration contingent on witness). Cost is felt in the risk and the refusal to reduce it to data; the ending’s “anchored to both sky and abyss” seals the before/after. The slightly truncated final line is a hairline seam but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the hum and image-pattern intensify toward a Charged Poise where she accepts a transmitter role. Causal steps are clean (glasses → hum → projection → plan), and the spaceport’s stir provides on-page response. The cost is present as a responsibility shift rather than a hard trade-off. The final sentence’s intentional ellipsis softens decisiveness, slightly blurring closure’s snap.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: reeds/kite → vault → embryo contact → proposal → unsealing. The lens reads Hybrid with a causal spine and lyric accumulation; closure lands on‑page via the unsealing and the community’s provisional adoption of a new ritual. Cost and reconfiguration register (tradition breached, elders’ protests, bodily risk). The kite’s arrival is a coincidence but serves as a functional inciting pressure rather than a resolution crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: detail density builds to the olive‑tree contact and the photograph’s reconfiguration, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“warning to witness”). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure’s cost—keeping grief without denial—is on the page. The choice to plant the photo and plan a return crystallizes the before/after without neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: fragmentation intensifies → redesign ritual → descent → repriced final image. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (the brined descent and leaving the portrait behind as offering). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the lighthouse’s physical constraints persist through the end. The “world” card/mirror and downward-pointing beam reweight the premise decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads primarily causal: observation → inference → doorway → confrontation/rescue attempt. Orientation is strong early, and set‑ups (ink patterns, drone frequency) do pay forward. Closure underdelivers: the final sentence truncates mid‑thought (“serenity could be as”), and even just before that, cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized, weakening the required on‑page closure unit. The chain is coherent but lands softly without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: vault entry → discovery of the crimson trigger → decision to awaken networks → public release → sirens/red text fallout. Closure lands as a decisive act with felt social cost (witnesses enlisted, alarms and pink snow as consequence). The drive lens reads Causal throughout and holds at the end. A hair more on immediate peril would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from the tower’s fall to the hatch breach to the pane’s crack, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“not silence, but a listening”). Orientation is clean early; single scene, single POV. Closure lands on‑page via the offered bloom and the dome’s literal strain, with legible conceptual and situational cost. The causal chain is soft but coherent, with the final image reweighting prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks and sonic density build to a bargain, then a paid cost. Closure is on-page and felt—she trades her defining attribute to keep the echo. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and each beat (“Low C” question mark, pause of constellations, bargain) coheres. The price persists into the final image (no longer cool-headed, “walking resonance”).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative lyric pressure) holds: the call → search → proofing → timed burn creates because/therefore linkage while images accrue toward closure. Closure lands on‑page with cost: the satellite deorbits at 4:09, reconfiguring the family’s shame while acknowledging lingering fragments. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when clear), and the constraint of orbital decay/clock shapes tactics. Minor magical‑realist leap (math altering orbit) is taught and paid off within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each object and pattern (letters→coordinates→amber→firmware→tattoo) tightens pressure and reweights options. Closure lands on the page with cost as she binds the cry to the insect and accepts a smaller, carried guilt. Orientation is swift and clean; the lab’s rules are taught through action and paid off at the end. The final image (bell jar, date label, quiet sky) completes a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: hush pressures speech, so she argues via pattern; density increases toward the blossom/silhouette sequences, then reconfigures as she exports hush to the city. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acceptance of unlearning and release of remembered ties. Orientation is firm from the first lines; no causality slips. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the exit and curb scene lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mosaic work and memory images layer until the charged act of replacing the pupil and continuing repairs reconfigures the plaza (low hum, exhale, sky stabilizes). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (choosing empathy and renaming over vengeance). Orientation is clean early (ancient plaza, after the fire, Azim/Leylah), and causality is coherent through the tactile sequence. The final sentence truncation slightly blurs the last cadence but the closure has already occurred.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from the coin’s thinning song to the hoop’s temporal scattering, to the tree absorption and crescendo of echoes, culminating in a charged poise: the hush before the overture is chosen and her form loosens. Closure lands with cost on the page (she lets go of being, not just the bow). Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and the piece keeps to one scene with a single stake. The pattern is taught and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density builds from shock → geode projection → somatic map → corridor → lens/circle → repricing of the recall. Orientation is crisp from line one (3:17 a.m., light painting studio, muscovite sliver). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: “recall = scarcity control,” followed by the decision to follow the tug into the city. The on‑page price is a relinquishing of safety for continued pathfinding; slightly understated but present.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through mapping, the fork decision, and the sleeper revelation; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the fossil’s causal thread is consistent. The final cadence (“map no longer hers,” caves sealing, fossil rewritten) crystallizes a before/after. The cost is on the page and shapes the end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: button‑by‑button patterning intensifies into a midnight release, the prophecy reframed as a question, and a decisive insertion of the pearl. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the live clock (dawn) binds the sequence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost—emptying the jar, spending the pearl, and reweighting the prophecy from fate to choice. The before/after is legible in the warehouse’s softened walls, the hourglass’s reversed sand, and the cliffs’ changed faces.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric build toward a charged poise: the clue‑trail tightens options and culminates in the pillbox click. Orientation is clear from line one; the throughline (Return/compass) coheres. Cost lands as risked trust before proof and the surrender of control to Mara’s terms. The smoke‑spelled “Roof” borders on contrived but doesn’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ticking gutters, fog, and needlework densify until the bead-for-memory exchange reweights everything. Closure lands on the page with cost when he gives the last smile and receives the bead. Orientation is clean from the opening; single continuous scene with one pressure arc. The final image reconfigures the premise without explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the lantern unfolds and timelines layer, reweighting “resistance to change” with the cost of attention (“brightened when… blooming, dimmed when… char”). Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 1–2), and the oasis’s rule set is taught through action. The cost is conceptual but legible: choosing gentleness shapes reality while the wasteland remains—hope with a residue of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds from the final petal’s fall to sap’s first bead to a coronet of buds, culminating in a charged final click. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses to keep instilling light, accepting fragility as cost. Orientation is immediate (harbor, fire escape, night) and consistent. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially jeopardized, keeping it shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the stone circle ritual tightens pressure toward a Charged Poise/Decisive Change: Mira chooses descent over archival stasis. Closure lands on the page with cost—the foreclosed path of remaining in the library—and the final image (feather‑descent, cloak adjusting pitch) reweights the premise. Orientation is swift and clean from the first line; motifs set early pay off precisely. No causality breaks; every transformation grows from established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrival → chance meeting → the “gifted” requirement → offering the twig → release of letters → entry into the temple. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she surrenders the twig and the temple absorbs the words, altering what connection means with a felt cost. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The “gifted component” constraint motivates the decisive act on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens: Causal—each choice prompts a concrete reaction (counter‑signal → crowd softening; tricksters’ counter → her mirror). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a charged poise where the town’s stance shifts and the comet’s light “softens,” with the transmitter left humming. Cost is present but modest (overheating, risk of perverting hope, bodily strain). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear causal beats: entering → corridor seals → organ reverberates → spatial reconfiguration → fusion of compass halves → widened exit. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (key obtained, labyrinth widens) and a resonant reconfiguration (grief recast as map‑making). Orientation is clean early; the throughline never wobbles. Cost is present in the goodbye and the relinquishing of fear as identity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned painting, object recurrence, and cadence shift culminate in a resonant reconfiguration (the eye, reunited ribbon, search dogs). Orientation is crisp from the outset (quarry, mist, night, Voss’s condition). Cost is present—he sacrifices pursuit/identification for an offering that summons authorities—though it’s quiet rather than scalding. The closure image reweights the premise without needing procedural resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal spine: stanzas trigger phenomena → hatch → mirror/offer → choice → reconfigured jet stream and vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lila remains to hold the vow while Morag returns, with the nail pinned as a charged token. However, the final sentence is truncated, and the “one adrift” price is a bit ambiguous, softening the cost’s on‑page clarity. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: music → coordinates → staircase → bridge, culminating in the fused plate and the hitchhiker’s disappearance. Closure is on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she gains the bridge but loses him, tasked to carry the fragment. Orientation is clear from the opening pullout scene and remains stable. The tightening cadence from gravel to bridge is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: demolition pressure + Mara’s dissuasion + money-as-markers build to a ritual that reweights the stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the paper fence and burning euro create a before/after with conceptual and material cost; drones retreat, path foreclosed. Orientation is clear early; the epilogue echoes the loop without undoing the on‑page cost. A hint of convenience in the drones’ confusion is tempered by the established marker tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies: stars → sound → “Witness” → naming → temple → payment → dawn. Closure lands on-page with cost: both surrender burdens, consolidated into a seed that reweights the world going forward. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean by the first lines; dream-logic transitions are taught and pay off without breaking coherence. A touch of convenience in the mechanism (“variable stars” unlock swiftly) is the only light drag.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: failed trick → lake/ice conditions → seed planted → confession extracted → blood price → vortex slows → conjurer returns. Orientation is immediate (druid, cursed lake, aftermath) and held in a single scene. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and felt cost, and the final image reconfigures options (bridge, two reflections). No teleports or soft resets; the planted setups all pay.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: scars summon → planting → maze → seed → sacrifice → mirrors adjust → new covenant. Closure lands on-page with cost and a decisive reconfiguration of world rules. Orientation is swift and stable, single scene, one throughline. Minor mythic logic leaps are internally consistent and do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: each ritual act tightens pressure toward a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost—“With each heartbeat, the tree drank another tomorrow”—and the inverted Tower bud recasts ruin as repair. Orientation is clear from the opening, and all set-ups (pins, card, orchard keeper) pay off. Cost is felt, not just asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of sound/silence and object handling tightens toward the decision to deliver the cloth. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—he foregoes the refuge of facts and the trailer to face the past. Orientation is clear early and the single scene holds together. The causal link from reframing the cloth (“not a relic; a question”) to action is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation is a density build (climb → scar → crown sign → inhalation → root asking permission) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands cleanly: she refuses the fruit and recasts “transition” as conversation, with an on‑page price (career metrics relinquished, scar carried). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the pattern taught early pays off in the final cadence. The last image reweights the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres through the ebb/flow clock and the intensifying ritual to a Charged Poise/RR at the lotus and pearl. Cost is legible—the last unindexed stories are consumed and their wonder ceded to the flower. The cadence is strong, but the final truncated sentence scuffs the landing and slightly blurs the after‑image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: confessions → pearl activation → communal silhouettes → dissolution → step into grass. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost (relinquishing the monarch‑of‑silence role). Orientation is clean early; set‑ups (pearl, shell, caves) all pay off on the page. The because/therefore is lyric, not mechanical, yet coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and acts compound toward a resonant reconfiguration (he forecloses the old map/lens and exits lighter by a confession’s weight). Orientation is crystal early; the sequence coheres through because/therefore textures (graffiti → speaking a name → instrument confession → tape as scar). Cost is on the page: he sacrifices the old compass and refuses a backward glance. The dangling final “and” is a small cadence glitch but closure lands before it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned signals (watch reversal, letters, mist‑library logic) build to a resonant reconfiguration where she relinquishes ownership and releases the words. Orientation is clean from the opening archway and purpose; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible on the page: surrendering the moment of belief, losing the veil, the library dissolving. The final forward‑ticking, cracked watch seals a before/after with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density rises (coffee → ivy → runes → snow) and culminates in a charged, on-page choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she selects the dream and activates the violin against the approaching envoys. Cost is legible in the forfeited imperial rewards and imminent consequences at the door. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the rule-set remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and patterned motifs build to the infusion and collapse. Closure lands on the page with cost—“no emerald left to weigh them down”—and reconfigures options (from hoarding sparks to distributing them). Orientation is clean from the opening and the scene maintains one continuous pressure. The final salon image reads as a coherent after‑state, not a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned images (vineyard/ash/hairpin/scallops) tighten toward an Earned Stasis closure. The closure lands on the page with cost (relinquishing the heirloom, accepting lifetime tending over heroic catharsis). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the ascent → ghost counsel → offering → joint planting progression coheres. Stakes narrow from abstract “contentment” to a concrete vow enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (cloak, mirror, chimes) intensify toward a stance crystallization when she orders the split delivery and reframes judgment as worn, not spoken. Cost is legible on the page (anger both sides; added weight). However, the final sentence truncates mid‑beat, undercutting cadence and closure’s landing. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rings, hush, magnetic pulse densify toward the release and the shore-kiss moment. Closure is a conceptual repricing: disappearance reframed as “translation,” with on-page cost (youthward drift, acceptance of self-erasure) and a precise timing constraint. Orientation is clean early and the pattern taught by mid-scene. The final cadence is earned and legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first line to closure, and the ending lands with explicit cost when she becomes a tower and the arrowhead roots. Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the pattern deepens coherently. Closure is a Decisive Change with Earned Stasis undertones; the price is the relinquishment of motion/self. No causality breaks or soft resets; motifs pay off exactly where promised.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each image escalates toward a quiet Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands on the page when he plants the drop and leaves the keystone as “nothing more than stone,” then turns back toward the academy. Cost is present but subtle—ambition traded for ordinary salvation—and the final “not to—” truncation reads as charged poise rather than confusion. A hair more concrete consequence would lift this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from lamp tones to sunken library to “Last Hymn,” with the sky lanterns as a soft clock. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and never wavers. Closure lands on the page: the unnamed color is found, the vow completes, and Miren relinquishes the key with felt cost. The throughline holds cleanly without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene tightens from coin‑circle hum to voice confirmation to the lens’ birth and her dissolution. Closure lands on the page with cost—she fuses the coins, sends light, and dissolves, reconfiguring cause and origin (CR with RR). Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). No causality breaks; the backwards prophecy directly shapes options and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual of scattered light → names → internal reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first line; the observatory, atlas, and cylinders cohere causally. Closure lands on the page with cost (names sinking into ribs; heartbeat restored; benediction). No loose set-ups or logic leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten toward the bell’s repair and a cadence shift at the toll; the droplets’ reversal back to descent is an on‑page decisive change. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and causality holds: his micro‑choices modulate the bell, which modulates the rain. The cost is explicit in the spoken name and blood. The closure image reconfigures options with stakes materially altered.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs (photos, label, mirror, wind chime) accrue toward an on‑page confession that reconfigures options. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and each beat links coherently to the next (ridge → shack/mirror → square). Closure lands with cost (“The dam was already broken, and I said nothing”) and changes the social contract. The communal naming seals a resonant reconfiguration without mechanistic over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of image and pattern coheres toward a closure with cost. The on‑page decisive act (palm to crystal) culminates in dissolution/translation—an unmistakable before/after with the price of self. Orientation is clean from the opening and every beat flows into the final reconfiguration. No stray set‑ups are dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from the cracked buckle to a full redesign, culminating in a charged poise ending (bow to the dummy; arbor’s hush). Orientation is clean and early; causality is coherent and the covenant’s price shapes tactics. Closure lands with cost (fatigue, vigilance, perpetual checking) and a reconfigured release protocol that will alter tomorrow’s options. Quiet but decisive cadence shift earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene situational lens holds: pressure accumulates as the clone draws the argument‑blade, Kael opens the jar (irreversible), the scroll rewrites, and the brain speaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: custody → stewardship, with an on‑page price (risking sensation, dissolving ownership). Orientation is clear early (dojo above rewritten Pacific, jar, scroll), and the time‑ripples shape the contract on the page. Minor convenience in the scroll’s grant is offset by the characters’ decisive surrender that enables it.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑POV, clean anchors (Mara, lodge, brook) and coherent Hybrid/accumulative causality: seed → influence → bloom → descent → surrender → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as the master key dissolves and Mara relinquishes control; the house’s autonomy is a decisive change and conceptual repricing. Set‑ups (the note’s riddle; mirrors/orthogonal movement) pay off in the staircase/cavern and living maze. No teleports or resets; pressure tightens toward a legible after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: sound density builds (cough → roar → movements) to a resonant reconfiguration where the house itself laughs. Closure lands with cost: fuel spent, grief macerated, and a tangible cadence shift as appliances hum in key and guests laugh in sleep. Orientation is clean from the hour/time anchor to the tunnel and kitchen. The visible truncation of the last sentence is a copy slip but the closure has already arrived.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration—the boundary holds by invitation rather than force. The scene anchors clearly and tightens through the child‑absence’s appearance, the echo‑key reveal, and the pendant’s transformation. Cost is conceptual but present: the guardian relinquishes control, reframing protection as hospitality, and risks empowerment of the acolyte. Closure lands cleanly in the altered pendant and thawing scents that reweight the world’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each successive approximation tightens pressure and culminates in a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands cleanly on the page with cost: blood sacrifice, surrender of memories to the crozier, and a new commandment that forecloses obedience. Orientation is clear early (ember nexus at twilight; broken crozier; aim to interrupt destiny). The final image (winged crozier unmaking certainty) reprices the frame without loose ends.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (Aether Spire above Black Gorge, lunar perigee, Kael’s role) and the pattern of building hush → union of shards → reweighted ending is coherent. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: the marble, the redefinition of beginnings, and the departure with a new credo. Cost is present as a reframed grief and irreversible integration of the shard, though the path there is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds patterned pressure (radio, light, heartbeat) toward a charged reconfiguration where the ferry reintegrates and Cass accepts ongoing duty. Orientation is quick and clean; the shift to the grotto is taught and then operationalized. Closure lands with cost—only she remembers; the ghost schedule adds persistent constraint. Causal links within the lyric mode are coherent, with the hourglass turn serving as the decisive tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via density and pattern shifts until the cadence tilts when she stitches into the gallery and the illusions still. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—she sacrifices autonomy to hold peace for visitors. Causality within lyric logic is coherent (“because she weaves, therefore corridors straighten; because escalation, therefore surrender”). The truncated last fragment slightly nicks cadence but doesn’t erase the achieved closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from balcony to glyph contact to trench dive to the reconfigured “surface.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—abyss becomes sky—with cost legible (taboo breach, leaving community, accepting a new rule‑set). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and every move is a because/therefore within the lyric logic. The final “horizon” image pays off the pattern with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses → figures gather → translation → names restored → vow → dispersal. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she commits to carrying stories, the hearing aid’s light goes dark, and the photograph’s weight recharges the stake. Orientation is solid from the first lines; single scene coherence is tight. Cost is on‑page in her acceptance of ongoing burden and the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure accrues via tide window, narrowing corridors, and the fleck-led passage into the lab, with a cadence shift at the song that activates the cables. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her aim from escape to keeper; the cost is ongoing return under the same constraints. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when within ~120 words), and motifs pay off causally (fleck → coordinates → repairs → shore). A slightly smooth middle (repairs proceed without complication) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds (ink → patterns → silhouette → mandala → vortex) toward an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/what pressure), and no causal cheats are needed. The closure image (shard fusing into a dark star, printer correcting the name) lands with conceptual and felt price. The counting mechanic functions as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a steady intensification toward the diamond‑mediated murmuration translates into sound, culminating in the crystallized final note and collapse. Closure is on‑page with cost: the language dies, towers crumble, the diamond heals, and her voice loses ancestral charge. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and each beat coheres causally within the chosen poetic logic. The grandmother seed cleanly pays off in the final act of listening/translating.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of phenomena builds (static → child’s voice → gravity play → metamorphosis) to a charged closure. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—“We were never lost, only rewritten”—paired with Vale’s mission and altered state. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the prior life, the garden collapses into a dewdrop, and she carries “frostbitten hope.” Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats inside an accumulative lyric: heart‑signal → statues falter → guardians escalate → climactic pulse frees them. Closure lands on the page with cost: the shell splits and crumbles, the bridge dissolves, and the orchard reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and pressure coheres. The final conceptual repricing (“beauty decides to stay”) is earned by the on‑page change.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through motifs (storm, drone, arcade) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the envelope’s return. The final repricing—checkpoint lights reading as lanterns—lands on the page and the cost is felt as ongoing endurance (carrying “weather and hope,” synchronizing with the soldier’s heartbeat). Orientation is clear by the first lines (arcade, border strip, courier and drone). The persistent constraint (war/border) shapes tactics (drone route, tunnel) and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: singing + halo action deepens and reweights stakes toward a Conceptual Repricing (“silence had never been absence, only canvas”). Orientation is clear early (abandoned circus train, carpenter, frost), and the beats cohere through a single corridor‑like progression. Closure lands on‑page with the train moving and the world reconfigured, the price being his renunciation of silence and self‑redefinition. Slight softness in explicit cost keeps this just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern intensifies (Fibonacci flicker → hyperbolic aisles → copper book → reawakening), then resolves to a reweighted stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the library’s “inhale,” altered light, and the scarf’s new weight mark a before/after. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks. The on‑page cost is conceptual and custodial, not visceral, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is swift (librarian on an eastern jetty at dawn) and pattern‑teaching is consistent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she relinquishes pursuit, shadowless, with a cracked lens; absence is reweighted “as a lantern,” and the price shapes the final map. Because the shadow‑cost and palette‑transfer persist into the last image, the before/after is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual acts accrete meaning until a decisive release; closure is on-page (the gate dissolves, melody/stars return, Aelira steps out). Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when/goal). The because/therefore chain is consistent within the ritual’s rules (first star → memory key → ribbon-threaded unlocking). Cost is present conceptually (years of pursuit, confronting communal scorn), though not pressed to pain in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: shard study → memory flashes → dark shard resistance → mushroom as ledger → song releases years. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands on the page with felt cost (memories “seasoned by absence,” leaving the shard embedded). One beat—the rapid understanding of the ledger—relies on lyric inference but is supported by the mushroom’s glow and the greenhouse’s “sigh.” Overall structure is tight and earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑POV progression with a taught ritual logic: annotation aligns with the swing/tea geometry → staircase → cup → drinking → return. Orientation is clear from line one; the library, hour, and objects are established early and pay off. Closure lands decisively with the girl’s solidification and the stewardship reframe, with tangible stakes if she refused. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative ritual pulse that coherently converts to a causal DC at the cup.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: ritual actions intensify, the toll mounts, and the closure image (tree remains; Arin gone) lands with on‑page cost. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and causality flows from the weaving’s toll to the final loss. The Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration co‑exist cleanly: worlds rewoven, pruner surrendered. The price explicitly shapes the ending (“roots found the silvering in his bones”), satisfying the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via beads of silence → suspended cloud → puncture, culminating in names released and hush dissolving. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost: Lira absorbs, then disperses, and accepts ongoing burden. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene holds. Minor line slips do not touch causality or the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observation → alignment → shadow fingers → adhesion → reweighting of absence delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the throughline is cohesive. The cost is legible in her renunciation and new ethic of mapping. One could wish for a slightly sharper on‑page consequence, but the closure image convinces.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens from entry to listening to the decisive act of mixing 1937 sky with seawater and abandoning the artifact. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a visible cost (offering empty palms). Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks. The final image reweights prior beats without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions accrete toward a cadence shift where silence reconfigures into song. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost turns from haunting to harmony, with the charged object closed and carried. Cost reads as the relinquishment of silence and the exposure of confessions. Orientation is clear early (courtyard above clouds, storm window), and set‑ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the climb’s floor‑by‑floor cadence tightens pressure toward the roof, with the cipher and light pattern deepening knowledge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: disobedience converts to a shared reclaiming of joy, with the fleet looming as cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor limitation: obstacles are mostly atmospheric rather than consequential setbacks, slightly softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds toward a conceptual repricing: the sky as a memory palace and the telescope’s purpose redefined. Closure lands when the atlas is completed and she touches down, committing to teach this reconfigured worldview. Cost is conceptual/emotional (renouncing pure empiricism; bearing grief/guilt), legible in the revised taxonomy and the charged telescope image. External causality is light, but the drift and failed instruments maintain a coherent frame.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies from discovery to floodlights to claw, culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing: the mural fractures into motes/pages, knowledge outlives containers, and the building’s loss is the cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; the live clock and the coin pattern shape tactics. The final cadence reweights the premise without tidy mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: noticing the hopscotch numbers leads to the spiral, the glow, the drawer, the lens, and the coordinates, culminating in turning the ship. Single POV with two linked spaces maintains coherence and momentum. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she inks the new island, the ship turns, and ordinary birds return. Cost is mostly prospective (risk to crew and disobedience) but legible enough.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned ritual (tick, pause, mend, release) tightens into the decisive act in the cracked mirror. Closure lands on the page with cost—the key fusing and identity shift (“the locksmith becomes the lock”). Orientation is clean and props/payoffs are honored (eclipse-light hum guiding to mirrors; petrified tear seals the fracture). The chain is elegant, though largely unopposed, which slightly softens causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is strong: chalk → Kiran reexamines → bell discovery → community forms → woven threads → nebula anchored → Luma’s dissolution. Closure reads as a decisive change with an on‑page cost and a reweighted world. The stakes are tracked and paid off through the final image of the bell anchoring the nebula. The clipped final fragment “Years later, Kiran—now” is a structural blemish post‑closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: descent → vision of costs → song → reconfigured role, with on‑page price (“The pane drank her song…” and it dissolves into her bloodstream). Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). The closure reads as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration (from adjusting clocks to carrying their lullaby) with a charged final image. The sequence is coherent with no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/causal braid holds: blueprints → nut‑oil tracing → wind‑plastered path → hikers crossing → cost released in smoke. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt price (spending the nut, exhaling the grandfather’s “unfinished works”) and a before/after is legible. Orientation is clear and the persistent constraints (no touching, frost clock, birds) shape tactics. The final turn is on the page, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: river, foam, quartz, and chemistry iterate toward a charged ritual. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration when she binds the chrysalis, chooses the middle path, and leaves the object behind with cost. Orientation is clean; causal links are associative but coherent. The on‑page price—relinquishing the chrysalis—grounds the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: quantifying absence → keyhole shift → imperative “forgive” → planting the seed → reconfigured aisles. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration and Conceptual Repricing—vendor becomes listener; beginnings require forgiveness—with a visible cost of relinquished role. Orientation is solid early (opening‑day lull, library) and pattern is taught and paid off. The causal ligatures are lyrical, not mechanical, but consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: descent → analysis → discovery → subsumption → reconfiguration → gentle reprise. Closure lands on‑page with cost via the salt‑flower crystallization and the labeled tin; the subsequent stew scene confirms the decisive change. Orientation is crisp from the opening. A minor cadence blemish—final word truncation—nicks the finish but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds polyphony and connective imagery until the cadence shift at dawn reconfigures the world’s speech. Closure is on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: silos accept the weight, confess isolation, and the clocks chime sixteen tongues. Orientation is clean from the opening (tower, Sora, prairie, night). Cost is conceptual/social (admitting isolation, re‑tuning from monolingual to braided speech) rather than contested on-page resistance, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds (mirror, moss patterns, memory channels) to a resonant reconfiguration where the mirror becomes functionally whole and the self reweighted. Closure is on-page with a conceptual price (identity altered, new role assumed), though the final sentence fragment undercuts cadence. Orientation is solid from the outset (who/where/what). A single meaningful tightening—choosing surrender over force—works, but the clipped ending dulls the final beat’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through the live clock (inverted gravity hour), the threshold’s convulsions, and the mercury planting, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as she exits charged to intervene in future lies. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when are clear), and motif return is well-sequenced. The cost is legible on the page (time forces an incomplete planting; physical jolt), with a charged final image. A slightly more explicit narrowing trade-off during the planting would tip this to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held through closure as sounds accrue toward birdsong. The decisive reconfiguration lands on the page when siskins begin to sing, reweighting the world from mute to tentative sound. Cost is legible: her throat, the insulator’s widened cracks, and the grove’s stored grief exhaled. One clean tightening arrives when she identifies the spiral/moment of muting and chooses to “enter the fracture.”

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through pattern recognition and the eclipse’s phases until the knight placement triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis) is on‑page: exile reframed into vocation. The price is conceptual but legible (foregoing courtly restoration in favor of a harder, broader remit). Causal links are modest but coherent; the cadence shift at resonance is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual actions deepen pressure until the clasp “sighs” and the memory reconfigures the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—empathy “locking open”—with visible emotional cost in the bruise and replayed night. Orientation is clean from the opening, and setups (tools, frequencies, fireworks) pay off. The path unfolds smoothly, with minimal risk of failure, slightly limiting felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ritual’s patterned beats (hourglass, seven visits, added serenity, tide reversal) build to a clean on‑page closure where the seed blooms and the rule re-prices: it needed story, not soil. Causality is coherent through motif, and orientation is anchored early (Liora, treetop loft, Sighing Verge). The cost is mostly conceptual/time-sacrificial rather than acute, slightly softening the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant: echo signal → arrow tip → memory revelation → sapling braid → insertion triggers the grove’s change. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the inversion clock plus narrowing path inside the arch supply coherent pressure. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and visible consequences (grove reconfigured, escape beat under returning gravity). Cost is legible in the risk of entrapment/crushing and the foreclosed retreat once she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: silk mapping → reverse flow → container → training → bulb bursts/ribbon snaps → decisive door slam restores the town. Closure is a decisive change with cost (risk of expansion, broken bulb, snapped ribbon) paid on the page. Orientation is crisp early and remains coherent through the maze. Setups (patch, wind, doors, tides) all pay off without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structured as an accumulative/textural progression toward a resonant reconfiguration: she transfers silence, creates the bell, and departs with the amber sheet blank. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/aim), and the pattern taught early (aurora/silence) pays off cleanly. Cost is on-page—the relinquishing of “the last of her guarded silence”—and the final cadence reweights the premise without breaking lens coherence. Minor friction: the journey is smooth, with few tactical adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the spiral reconfiguration and gold‑leaf sigil produce a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the stake from mending to tending. Causality is coherent across beats (markers → spiral → fracture opens → new sigil → reoriented guardianship). Closure is on the page with cost (“not as a wall but as a song”), though the final sentence truncation (“and the echo that”) slightly blurs the cadence. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure ratchets via vanishing stars, leaks, and autonomous press, culminating in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on page with cost—the cracked halo, destroyed prints, relinquished persona—while reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean from the first line. The backward run of the press is a precise causal pivot that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: encounters stack under the aurora until the hooded figure reframes the mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Mira refuses the hand‑off and repurposes the pendant. Cost is on‑page (identity trade, mentor’s absence accepted). Orientation is clear early, and the single meaningful tightening at the cliff aligns with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure densifies from hush to translation to demanded reciprocity. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she reframes the thesis (objects witness/return) and sacrifices the prism—which lands with cost on the page. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the throughline never breaks. A hair shy of 9+ only because the cost remains more contemplative than consequential in-world.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds pressure through object recurrence and cadence, paying off with the bead completing the puzzle and dissolving into the loom-map. Closure lands on the page with cost: “She would never hear her brother’s reply.” Causality is clean across two shards (orchard → monks → orchard) with no teleports. The silence reweighted as bridge constitutes a clear conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: silk’s offer → refusal → failing orchards → discovery of unbroken azure → barter → forging lattice → application → transformation with cost. Closure lands with the brother’s voice and the silk’s transference, reweighting the premise (memories alloy rather than vanish). Stakes tighten through one decisive trade that narrows options and charges later communal barters. Minor montage afterward deepens consequence without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal throughline: shard pulses → fold to the live bay → console revelation → decision to stop cycling → embedding the shard. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she renounces further universe‑hopping, seals the shard, and revalues “world” as a moment, with cost legible in relinquishing ongoing crossings. Orientation is clean; the taught pattern (lyric, dream‑physics) holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: letters, stones, and ghostly presence intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as he literally bottles safety and commits to ongoing duty. Orientation is clear by the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost via the flask marked “Return” and the vow to keep the chain. The tightening is modest but purposeful: the widow’s gesture forces an action beyond his usual stone code.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal threads: the fracture reveals a map; therefore he aligns mirrors; therefore the lighthouse charges; therefore the lens cracks; therefore the door opens. Closure lands on the page with cost: the lighthouse crumbles and Kael becomes the storm. Orientation is firm from the outset, and the pattern taught (routine → fracture → steering) pays off at the end. The price and the before/after are legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens as light becomes trail, trail becomes staircase, staircase becomes pool—each step tightening toward surrender. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Kael accepts permeable selfhood, the wing’s exhaustion, and vows a new ethic (“I will carry you…”). Cost is legible on the page—the wing’s sacrifice, the dissolution of boundaries, and Kael’s renunciation of guardedness. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and all turns grow from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds toward the resonant reconfiguration of the sextant. Closure lands with the reassembled instrument projecting a circle that reframes grief and witness; cost is conceptual (transforming sorrow rather than erasing it). Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic of beats coheres without causal gaps. The cost is soft but legible in the golden seams and the labyrinth’s hum.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned singing and binding escalate toward the culminating sky-covering tapestry. Orientation is clean early (mica window, greenhouse, orchard at night) and the closure lands with cost and a reconfigured world state. The night’s pushback provides coherent pressure without breaking the lyric mode. The final image (memories scattering; orchard holding them) delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images accrue (seam, candles, mirrors) to a conceptual repricing where the error becomes the map and she declines the route. Orientation is clear early (library at 11:47 p.m.; seam between biography and architecture). Closure is on‑page with cost: choosing not to follow the self‑drawn map and writing a new invitation shifts options and identity. The countdown candles and misaddress motif persist as constraints through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the tea, bread, and seeds accrete into a charged act of planting that reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (a treaty with time; partial forgetting) and a charged final image (first shoot through frost). Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is quiet but coherent. No beats contradict the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure: Decisive change with conceptual repricing—she abandons measurement, releases the vows, and the library dissolves, paying with vocation/identity. The pattern of measuring → recognition → redefinition is coherent and the cost is legible (“library begin to dissolve,” vow melting into skin). Orientation is clear early; the taught refrain (“While illusions faded…”) supports the cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean single‑scene structure with because/therefore causality: truce → recorder armed → Roe’s counter‑move (photo) → Lila’s reversal and destruction of evidence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with a visible sacrifice (fob surrendered, tape destroyed). The pressure window (“until sunrise,” 30 minutes left) tightens options. Slight convenience in Roe’s anticipatory photograph keeps it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and clean causal links: taste → discovery → Mara’s revelation of stakes → convergence ritual → forest’s decision → reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (ring dissolves; aurora dims) and a new constraint (shared weather). Orientation is immediate and consistent within a single scene. The only slight softness is the ease of the convergence, but the election clock and cost keep it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions (lock → painting → vial → repair → naming) accrue into a decisive reconfiguration. Closure is on the page: the repaired lock “will never open again for anyone but her” and the exit is “a mirror,” with the key her restored name—an earned stasis that forecloses the old path. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the aboveground lie and the binding of self to calling. Orientation is clean from the outset (artist, cave, broken lock).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a Hybrid lens (causal spine with lyric accumulation), the sequence is coherent: find map → decode → descend to jars → test honesty rule → accept mission to return words → plant and commit to reading. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive behavioral change on the page (speaking to strengthen the vapor; shifting to plain paper). Costs are emotional and vocational (abandoning gilded artifices). Escalation could use one sharper external counterforce, but causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as images intensify from construction to color-sphere to tear; the cost (ice fragment spent, deepened silence, gift of petals) is legible. However, the final line truncates mid‑action (“he opened the sealskin; the tear rose, hovered”), reopening stakes and muddying closure. Prior charged-poise beats nearly land Earned Stasis, but the unfinished final beat undercuts on‑page closure. Orientation and coherence are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with Accumulative dominance: pressure accrues via wildfire ETA and magnetic reorientation; resolution is a ritual that reweights meaning and alters the external outcome. Closure lands on‑page: the inner static resolves as he contains fire, and the outer wildfire finds no fuel—a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing childhood objects). Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (compass roses, box, irrigation) pay off. Minor ding for the truncated final fragment “Hours later, the,” though closure has already landed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (Causal with Accumulative/Textural lyric): rumor → investigation via storytelling → locket retrieval → mailbox opening → communal reading. Orientation is clean from the opening lines, and set-ups (box welded shut; locket lore) pay off precisely. Closure lands on-page with cost: exposing sealed grief under curfew pressure and reconfiguring the courtyard’s silence. No causality gaps or convenience patches undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and closes with a charged reconfiguration: shard taken, safe irrevocably jammed, surface lights dying as the die reads I FORGIVE. Orientation is immediate; the spider‑clock and lunar‑tide code form the procedural spine. Cost is legible in the renunciation (fusing shut, leaving the die, carrying dangerous knowledge). The pattern taught (motion as language) pays off at the click and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story escalates coherently from whale → flowers → chamber → sieve → descent → basin, culminating in a charged final act (tasting the lemon memory). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: memories have weight, can be crystallized and partially restored, which reweights the opening. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than punitive, but the price of confronting loss and risking change is felt. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and set-ups (flowers, gravity, coffee grounds) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure gathers via the river code, canopy, spiral, and the prophecy’s voiced threat. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes the prophecy and adopts listening as tactic, transforming the code into peace downstream. The cost is conceptual—rejecting total silencing in favor of risked attentiveness—visible in her pause and recalibration. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the seal-mediated “lessons” densify until the branding and wall’s answer reprice meaning. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and time’s brief montage serves cadence and pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator becomes a conduit with cost (branding, promise-weight). Setups (seal, “agreed upon lies,” rooftop garden) pay off at the meteors and sealing of the body.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres around the live clock and the ritual’s cadence. The closure lands cleanly: the garden is gone, the voice falls silent, and the archive lives within—an on‑page cost with a before/after hinge. Orientation is clear by the first lines; the pattern (resonance → deeper access → collapse/translation) is taught and paid off. No causal gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative, ritual cadence that culminates in a causal act: unlinking ink → blood drop → key activation → treaty’s ash. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure lands on the page with a felt cost (relinquishing the forger’s tool/role). No dangling setups; the “key with no lock” resolves conceptually and visually. The because/therefore chain is tight enough for the scene’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates via density and pattern—song → echoes → co‑singer → shell reunion—toward a charged refusal that reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page when she fuses the shell into the rock, choosing endurance over release; the cost (foregoing freedom for the trapped and letting the stranger dissolve) is legible. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern taught early pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual acts intensify, imagery densifies, and the final salvage reconfigures the premise with cost. Orientation is immediate (glacier shrine, Nadia, the globe), and the sequence coheres: signal to expose → relics appear → transfer of “pure snow” → sealing a locket. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—truth confronted, sorrow borne—and the empty globe/star image seals the after. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clear, and causal links are coherent (whistle → guard → handoff → echo to the boy). There is an implied closure in the transmission of craft, but the final sentence cuts off mid‑line, undermining on‑page closure and the cost beat’s resonance. The price (giving away the whisk) is present but lightly felt. The structure holds as a single continuous scene with a late echo, yet the incomplete ending damages cadence and final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: orchard → Apple → satchel → reassembly → revelation (Council, graves, father) → choice. The closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she replants the Apple and forecloses broadcasting, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is swift and solid, and the hybrid lens tilts causal at the end. The paper compass fuse charging the final act is a tight payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: storms, portico, numbers, chord ladder, congregation, and lightning intensify toward the charged final image. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing/RR when “Remember” is spoken and the world lightens, with the cost signaled by “would not be gentle.” Orientation is clean early; pattern is taught and paid off. Minor softness: the causal hinge from numbers to embodiment remains mystical rather than tactical, but consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: ritual action layers until the cadence breaks when the ballerina moves and the chorus sentence forms. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established quickly) and the closure lands on the page with conceptual cost. The final image—chorus traveling on dunes, footprints erased—reconfigures the premise with an earned, quiet inevitability. No causality breaks; each step grows from prior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/why), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual steps reconfigure the wail into a lullaby. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the key melts, the keeper’s duty ends, and the world’s risk is repriced. Beats link coherently—piercing note, ice as throat, colored sound, relit beacon—without convenience. The price is legible on the page and inflects the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues patterned action and image (compass, moon holes, basalt shards) to a charged cadence shift when the ice speaks and the viaduct surfaces. Closure lands on the page (RR: a communal reconfiguration from panic to patience), with a conceptual price (surrendering impatience); orientation is clean throughout. Cost is felt but light—risk on the lake and social reversal are implied more than pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive (causal discoveries within an accumulative, sensory pattern) holds to closure. The decisive reframe—naming the death as protection and choosing a new report—lands with conceptual cost (defying mentor, recoding her role) and a charged act (leaving the lantern burning). Orientation is clean from the outset; beats tighten as the map, scorch marks, and journal converge. Slight convenience in the on‑page journal inscription softens pressure but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: letter → shop → clockwork heart → chapel confrontation, with the object solving the specific harm Rowan caused. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Elias physically takes Rowan’s wrist and echoes “Second opinions,” signaling a before/after. Cost is legible: Rowan relinquishes the heart and faces potential rejection. Orientation is clear across the two shards; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-making → forging → striking → unheard propagation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration—the silent bell becomes world-structuring sound (“the sea is listening”), with on‑page costs (arrow tip dissolves, blisters, dissolving anchor chain). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what), and the kaleidoscope method is taught early and paid off. The final image reweights prior beats without backfill.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative finish: the 117 pattern deepens, leading causally to the locker, the drive, the lie, and the copy/forgery tactic. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she saves what she can, forecloses her role, and exits with cost. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/why) and the demolition clock imposes real pressure. The cost is legible on-page as exile/wanderer status rather than abstract sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear accumulative/textural build from mirror glimpses to a charged reconfiguration, with the treaty acceptance and the fragment’s loss as on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the motif pattern is taught early and paid off. The closure feels earned without mechanical over‑explaining. Slight softness remains in the absence of a sharp mid‑scene snag or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: the parasol tip, ice sounds, and storms accrue toward a reconfiguration. Closure lands when Mara accepts endurance over escape (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis) with a visible cost. Orientation is clean from the first line; causal links (storm → trawler → old woman’s guidance → listening) hold. The final image reweights prior beats without explaining them away.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and patterns (rows, trellis, seventh‑row gaps) build toward a Conceptual Repricing where absence becomes formative. Closure lands on page with cost via burning the letter and planting ash. Orientation and scope are clean: single POV, one continuous scene, one dominant stake. The bus’s absence and seventh‑row pattern tighten cadence to a charged poise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via the echo dimming and ritual intensification rather than plot reversals. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she consecrates by relinquishing control and distributing the echo, with a concrete cost stated (“preservation meant surrendering control”). The final silver speck in the engine reweights the premise with a lasting constraint and ongoing price. Orientation is clear from the opening and stays coherent in one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the laying of photographs, arrivals, spiral completion, and twilight transformation steadily reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—relinquished memories, the archivist’s emptied case, and the field’s charged new state. Orientation is clean from the opening image; no causality breaks. The price is felt conceptually and emotionally, even without an antagonistic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sonic density builds to the chord “become,” then resolves to a softer hush as he restores the crystals. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: growth through surrender, not decoding, with a felt cost of relinquishing control. Orientation is immediate (library at dawn) and consistent. The second crystal’s discovery risks convenience, but under this lens it deepens pattern rather than breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens from search to creation (spiral/nautilus/record groove) to recording, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the note is his own echo, kept at a cost. Orientation is clean from the first line; set pieces (TV tower, fog spiral) pay off. Closure is on-page with cost: he’s transformed into a sculpture; his name gone yet listening remains. The causal thread within the lyric frame holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: tremors, cadence, spiral gears, and the leaf‑sound build to a charged act—holding the shutter until the film exhausts. Closure lands on the page with cost (empty, transparent canister; the ache reconfigured), a clean Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Orientation is crisp from the outset (lunar observatory, quakes, camera) and the motif payoffs are honored. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through layered sounds toward a Charged Poise closure: the wrist completes the missing shard as Mrs. Eland’s breath ends with the runoff hiss. Orientation is clean from the first lines and stakes are coherent. The cost—letting her own pulse complete the circle—lands on the page. The pattern taught (hymning the mundane) pays off at closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal chain under a Hybrid leaning Causal lens: key → automaton → sundial/memory → hidden door → mirrors/spoon → insertion/sacrifice. Closure lands via a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing (“To relearn is to forgive the forgetting”) with the cost of stopping the automaton. Minor deduction for the truncated final sentence that blunts cadence, though the decisive act precedes it. Orientation is clean early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal beats with accumulative lyric pressure) holds: discovery → maze → meeting → ritual → repriced ending. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the child’s bones knit into light and the tooth’s meaning is reweighted, with the cost of accepting the death and recasting guilt. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (tooth, bone‑setting, lullaby) pay off. Slight convenience in the girl’s timely appearance and a clipped final fragment nick the perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from arrival to polishing to union with the pearl, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration: the village illuminated and the shard surrendered. Orientation is clear from the opening (who/where/why), and the throughline holds. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence. The progression is smooth rather than nail‑tight, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmosphere to the decisive cadence shift when the pendant refracts “forgive,” and Lira commits to the graft. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why) and the scene holds single‑window continuity. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses public recrimination for a living answer, with conceptual cost. The small magical mechanism (amber hologram) is taught and paid off without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a procession of cameos tightens toward the vortex and the naming ritual. Closure lands on the page with cost: each name smooths a ridge, reconfiguring her relation to her characters and craft. Orientation is taught early (novelist at a misty nexus; liminal timeframe) and pays off with the study return at dawn. The final image (plain white sliver; new notebook) functions as a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of Dawnfold → Noonturn → Eventide builds toward a clear on‑page revival of the Heartroot (a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost). Orientation is solid from the first lines, and the structure holds one coherent scene with a single stake. Cost registers mostly as restorative urgency and loss reclaimed rather than sacrifice. A clean, legible cadence shift lands at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual density tightens to the obsidian seal’s click, which lands closure with cost (sacrifice of gathered objects to rust, disciplined grief, charged carry). Orientation is crisp from the opening image and never wavers. The final charged poise—seven constellations beating against her heart—reconfigures options without soft reset. The constraint of silence/patience persistently shapes tactics through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: measured angles, daylight/night/frost density, and reflections compound toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: wonder is trapped, the timer runs in reverse, and the world reweights into “ordinary winter,” with the swallows gone. Cost is legible on the page—the choice forecloses immediate experience to preserve it. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and the two‑shard structure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure via Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing; the ritual intensifies until the avalanche burden softens and transfers. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the sequence escalates coherently through the ritual steps to a decisive cadence shift when the black sphere hisses and yields. Cost is on the page (“ribs turning first to coral, then to stone”) and persists into the final image (lamp ember, tether redefined). The before/after is unmistakable: trapped → released with a new, gentler tether and a world reweighted to carry human burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern and density build toward a resonant reconfiguration as the kettle’s countdown tightens. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when), and the closure lands on‑page with cost—the choice to compress love into an object and carry it. The kettle’s whistle, the here/gone cadence, and final pocketing fuse into a legible before/after. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern (collect, bargain, release) tightens to a resonant reconfiguration: she feeds the fragments back, rides backward, and accepts a permanent halt. Cost is visible in relinquishing ambitions and the emptied camera wheel. Orientation is surreal but clear early; the world rules are taught through action. The closure image (silver coin/forever halt) lands decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate; the beat pattern tightens from hum → rotunda → fountain → water → vine → dawn, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of the terminal as sextant and hope as redirectable flow. Closure lands on the page (the rerouted pump, the bloom, the placed sextant), with cost present but soft (time, acceptance of loss). No causality breaks; the pressure coheres as density and pattern rather than plotted reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through hush, crystal reconfiguration, and sphere absorption, culminating in a stance shift. Closure largely lands (he leaves lighter/heavier; begins building with memory, the bell muffled), but the text truncates mid‑final sentence, blunting cadence and cost at the last beat. Orientation is clean and cause/response within the lyric logic holds. The cost is present but not maximally charged on the page due to the clipped ending.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clear by line two (houseboat on a canal at dusk) and the causal sequence tightens: sundial points backward → charts form spiral → rope tether → walk to hatch → cut rope → step through. Closure lands on the page with both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: she becomes part of the map and the sundial’s shadow reorients forward. The cost is legible (severing the tether to “what was real” and losing the canal as it vanishes). The hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: decoding → glow → weavers → fulgurite → keeper knot → charged mission. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Hara takes the coil and a new path. Cost is present but subtle (abandoning prior identity), which tempers a push into the 9s. No causality breaks; each image logically deepens the prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating images (lantern words → gold swirl → moths → dissolving face) lead to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as she forecloses waiting and ties the thread—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when). Setups (thread, last ship) pay off in the final harbor and fountain images.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning causal: the stalactites’ progressive failure creates a ticking clock, Halric assembles a ritual, revelation reframes “flawed genesis,” and the leap triggers world reversion. Closure is on‑page via Decisive Change with felt cost (the palace/line ending) and a charged final image (sparks restoring wild color). Setups (egg, artifacts, cranes) pay off coherently. The slightly truncated last line is a cosmetic slip, not a structural wound.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and acts accrete toward a Charged Poise closure as she surrenders the thread/coin and sets the bird adrift. Orientation is clean from the opening and the father’s stake anchors causal history. The cost—letting go of her talisman—lands on the page and reweights prior material. The final line’s clipped “so pure” feels intentionally open but edges toward truncation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal climax: breadcrumb accumulation culminates in the decisive act of pressing the shard to the box, which unplugs the pipes and restores the fountains. Orientation is immediate and clean; the single-scene progression is coherent. Closure lands with cost (tool emptied and given up; stance reconfigured) on the page. The solve is a touch easy at fable scale, but consistent with the taught rules.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring images (gear/petals/light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gear stops and ancestors fold into the drift. Orientation is clean early (who, where, why). The cost is legible in the closing beats (releasing the object and self-dispersion). Minor deduction only because the very last fragment cuts off mid-phrase, softening the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ritual repetition, butterflies, and poems build to a cadence shift where the migration completes and the single carved line reweights meaning. Closure lands on the page: villagers weep at the stone; Mara commits to a new custom—an RR/CR blend with visible emotional cost. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the montage of weeks is contained and purposeful. The causal thread (mentor → ribbon-map → carving → unveiling) stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: the ritual on the ridge deepens pressure, then causally delivers the bob insertion and winding; the chime functions as a closure beat (RR). Orientation is clean from the start, and stakes cohere. The cost—bearing communal guilt and altering the clock’s balance—appears on the page. The final sentence is truncated (“Elara listened to”), slightly blurring the ending cadence and costing some closure crispness.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each image intensifies toward a charged poise: map → names → blank → door → refusal. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with cost—the chance to step into a forgiving morning is relinquished to continue tending. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Setups (clock, coin, tapestry) all pay off without teleports or patching.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal underpinnings. Closure lands via an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forgoes omnipotent authorship for partnership, with cost (unchosen paths, dulled nib) on the page. Orientation is clean early; pressure coheres from frost‑equations to spire response to final sigil. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible and tied to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the radio’s emergence, dust’s animation, and co‑conducting intensify toward a resonant closure. Closure lands with cost when she chooses stewardship—gathering motes into a vial and accepting delay (“until ears grow hungry again”). Orientation is clean from the opening, and setup/payoff threads (no blank pages → dust as score) are honored. The cost is subtle but legible and tied to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through motifs (ash, mask, vanishing point) toward a charged poise. Closure lands when she removes and displays the fused mask, accepting the “mirage of safety” at real emotional cost. Orientation is clear (gallery, rocking chair, curator silhouette), and the single‑scene structure tightens with the chair’s slowing. The price is legible in the relinquishment of the mask’s protection and the swallowed final name.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, landing in Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—he renounces the clean narrative, discovers viable seeds, and offers them to the regime at personal cost, then walks away. Because/therefore accrual is clear: mapping layers → contradictions → second cog inscription → seeds → offering. Closure has conceptual cost (forsaking convenience, risking himself), but the truncated last line mars cadence and slightly softens the final image’s snap.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and patterns (silence, birds, geese, breath) densify until the charged offering of the rosette and the years-later return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the relinquishment of bitterness and transfer of stewardship. Orientation is clear from the outset and the two-shard coda coheres. The because/therefore is lyrical rather than causal, but consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear, and the piece deepens via recurring objects and images, but closure is undercut by the abrupt truncation (“Mar”) that withholds the final cadence and cost. The ending gestures toward a Resonant Reconfiguration yet doesn’t land it on the page. Without a completed final beat, the before/after remains suggestive rather than decisively earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: found object → riddle → ascent → match → hum → luminous bees → reweighted stance. Closure reads as resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (the blackout as cocoon; “the song changed key”) with a modest on‑page cost (the emptied matchbox, relinquished expectation). Causality within the magical logic is coherent with no teleports or resets. Stakes remain focused and the final image consolidates the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens taught early and held: object‑by‑object hush builds to the compass touch, bay stillness, and the role‑renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she leaves the shard and exits as a different self. Orientation is crisp from line one; the note in her handwriting deepens rules without breaking coherence. The final cadence reweights the premise (absence as echo) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ampoule’s arrival → revelations → self‑suturing → invitation → communal return creates a coherent tightening. Closure lands on the page as a decisive reconfiguration: statue redefined and garden reanimated with conceptual cost (certainty admits incompleteness). Orientation is clear early and serves the ending image. The persistent constraint—being a statue—shapes tactics and the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: patterned ascent, math marks, and dice build to a cadence shift when the crack opens and he proves a bridge. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he accepts a gentler staircase and keeps walking after offering the die. Cost is legible in remaining on his side as the light thins. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (dice, proofs) pay off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: painting → thickening moonlight → visitors → singing brush → lantern‑glyphs → stars → relinquishment. Closure lands on the page with cost (the brush crumbles; she yields to sleep), reconfiguring the city’s relation to kindness. Orientation is strong from the opening, and beats link causally via the brush and moon. The final sunrise sentence truncates mid‑image, nicking cadence but not the achieved closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance holds: sensory patterns (waterfall/bees/chords/bread/initials) accrue until a charged reconfiguration. Causality is clean—failed lens attempt, Amara’s recipe, the decision to burn pages, baking initials—leading to the oven’s chord and communal memory’s return. Closure lands on the page with conceptual repricing (“culture… must be broken and shared”) and the cost is dramatized via the sacrificed manuscripts. Orientation is crisp within the first lines (who/where/when) and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise as the universe hesitates and the yoyo becomes a Möbius loop. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the pattern of inversion is taught then paid off as pulse and beam reweight meaning. Cost is legible on the page: the hunger stone is consumed, the lighthouse staggers, ships lose course, the causeway sinks. A slight softness remains in concrete resistance, but the closure lands with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: confession triggers the recursion; dictionary cues the “exit wound”; black mirror choice resolves. On‑page closure lands with cost: the advisor is trapped, reflections crack, and the narrator bears residue. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence holds. Minor rule surrealities (clasp swallowing a book) are taught by pattern and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on the page: reef reconfigured into a marimba and the orchard passes—a decisive reweighting of the hazard. Because/therefore links are lyrical but coherent (cloud reading → carving → resonance → reef pivots → final chord). Cost is implied risk and commitment to approach the hazard; clean single-scene arc with one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning causal: sound‑mapping leads to the crack, to the staircase, to the expedition’s warning, to the keening chord that opens the gate. Closure occurs on the page with visible cost (bleeding lips, city tremor) and a decisive change (the gate opens; they pass through). Orientation is clear from the outset and maintained. The watchers’ response is mysterious but causally legible given the pattern‑language motif.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds cleanly to closure with a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the project as persuasion, not mere excavation, with a literal blood price. Orientation is immediate (station, archive car) and each discovery compounds meaning. The whistle “illusion” functions as a taught pattern supporting the ending. Stakes resolve to a charged stance rather than a solved problem, appropriate for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each note and measurement thickens the pattern toward a charged poise when the pavilion answers and the inkwell bears a map. Orientation is clean from the opening (drawbridge, pavilion, night window). Closure lands with conceptual cost—she becomes the bearer of others’ absences under a live clock. A minor cadence nick from the truncated last token doesn’t break the closure but scuffs its finish.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a hybrid lens leaning causal, beats link cleanly: blackout → discovery of stamp → test (rotating compass) → vault entry → tablets → reframed origin → new catalogue stance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with an earned stasis/charged poise: she pockets the stamp and commits to hypotheses over certainty, with the indices poised to “overwrite doubt.” Cost is conceptual and institutional rather than physical but is present on the page. Orientation is crisp from the outset; scope fits the window.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual steps build pressure toward the moonstone cracking and the cranes’ release. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/why), and each beat logically proceeds to the next. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: transformed grief, a charged constellation, and a future‑tilted image on the returned crane. The cost is legible in her deliberate re‑exposure to the traumatic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (drone strike survivor in a floating observatory) and the accumulative/textural lens holds with clear causal steps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she accepts a new identity as perturbation and broadcasts coordinates/frequency, paying with relinquishment and ongoing risk. The cooling breakers provide a clean temporal frame and the click/reboot marks the cadence shift. Minor hand‑wavy science never breaks causality or the closure’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → decoding under the “right” sky → projection → following pulsing trails → conceptual compass. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (home as frequency) with a felt cost of relinquishing destination. Causality is coherent, though the chip’s convenient presence leans fated more than pressured. The final line fragment is a polish slip, but closure has already landed.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric density and clean causal turns: shore search → watch hand → note → explicit choice. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the single transition back up to the terrace is clear. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (choosing voice, repairing the watch) and a felt price (renouncing her erasures). No dropped setups; props and images pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a tight ritual sequence build to on‑page closure when the cords snap and the exchange resolves. The chosen lens reads Accumulative/Textural, with pressure coalescing via image and cadence; the drawer pull’s reprise and half‑moon reflection mark a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the relinquishments and the ritualized, non‑apologized regret. No causality slips; the rules are taught early (moon phase, neutral line) and held.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring objects and lights accrete until the realization (“ride the current”) reconfigures options and culminates in leaving the compass. Orientation is crisp from the outset (coastal launch at night/fog), and causality is emotionally coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: from chasing to accepting, with cost legible in the surrendered tool and the walk back. No plot amnesia or soft resets undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal spine under a hybrid lens: reading margins → descent → labyrinth navigation → vending machine oracle → sacrifice → changed headline/action. Closure lands with on‑page cost (giving up the time‑traveler ball) and a charged return path (“lake began to rise… leaving only the straight line back”). Stakes tighten coherently as options are literally narrowed. Orientation is clear early and pays off at the ending image without dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and a causal tightening: ritual → partial shift → spirit’s condition → full surrender. Closure lands on the page with cost: she becomes guardian, abandoning her human name, and the bond is reforged. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; the single scene remains coherent. The fortune’s reprise and the phoenix cycle provide felt consequence beyond the act.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and ritual actions densify toward a resonant reconfiguration as the saucer seals “not healed but accepted.” Orientation is set early (who/where/why), and the two-shard glide back to the nursery pays off the built pattern. Cost is legible: she cannot truly regain time; she accepts the scar and reweights love as the tactic. No causal breaks or soft resets; the closure image is charged and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned acts (stitching, naming, offering) deepen pressure toward a clear on‑page closure. The Decisive Change lands when she dissolves the Tear to open the door; cost is explicit. Orientation is clean from the first lines (ship, Lin, chapel, AI), and set‑ups (photos, sigil) pay off. A minor truncation on the final word does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from releasing jars toward the final charged image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: giving redefined as translation, sealed by the glass handprint and trapped light—cost legible in the emptied belt. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/what). The volcano/glass motif grounds the cadence shift without causal fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → sigil → seam → sundial angles → forge → birds → return to post → pamphlet. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she remains sentinel while having catalyzed revolt, with risk visible (guards pass, Regent demands). Orientation is crisp from the first lines. Minor softness: the final “For she” fragment distracts but doesn’t break the closure already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases toward a charged poise where the promise is re‑priced (“so the stars can finally rest”) and the jar is won at a cost. Orientation is clear from the opening (where/who/what world rule) and each beat flows from the last through purposeful pattern work. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration and a brief Decisive Change (catching the dust, curse lifting for a breath) with a felt price of continued duty. No causality gaps; the tightening is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned objects (timer, negatives, telescope, storm) escalate density to a closure image that reweights meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: she releases the poem into the sky, pays with the loss of secrecy and the permanence of scars, and the empty envelope evidences cost. Orientation is clear by line one (who/where/what tonight) and the pattern is taught early and paid off. Causality is lyric but coherent: the storm enables development and projection; the timer’s backward run tightens cadence, not logic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of codes, light, and blades densifies until the overture’s reveal reweights the encounter. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the duel reframes into mutual listening, and the final message shifts the stance from opposition to alliance with a conceptual cost (relinquishing solitary control/contest). Orientation is clear early, and the object-pattern is taught and paid off. The price is subtle but present; a slightly clearer narrowing of options at the peak would strengthen causality-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure mounts from entry to “the warden will torch the annex,” prompting a charged improvisation (“then tonight we bloom”) and burial of the tin. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR—vow plus buried tin under sapling—with legible cost (departure, risk, identity’s slippage). Orientation is clear from the start, single POV and one primary scene with a brief, effective coda. Minor ding: the final clipped word (“rev”) slightly scuffs polish, though closure stands.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accrete (clock, compasses, reel) toward a reweighted end where music alters fate. Closure lands with cost—the clock explodes into the lily, time’s old order sacrificed—and a new stasis (night postponed; he begins a new piece). Orientation is early and legible despite the surreal. Each move feels “therefore”: compasses → booth → splice → stolen frame → performance → reconfigured horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: petals forgetting → seed planted → dream library browning → witnesses summoned → monsoon entering the dream → bite and wake. Closure lands with a decisive change (memories anchored; sapling alive) and a priced stance (luminous doubt persists). Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from rain‑calm to ritual activation (mist, instructions) to the charged release, with the final vow and adrift image delivering Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis. Orientation is clear from the outset (islet, tutor, the recent parting), and the pattern is taught then paid off. Cost lands on the page in her refusal to verify the “answered apology” and in letting the map/vessel go. Recurring objects (compass, lace) persist as constraints and shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds through a sequence of resonant, fantastical images rather than strict causality, leading to a powerful climax. The closure is a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias returns to his purpose, now re-consecrated. The cost is made tangible on the page: his bleeding fingers, the symbolic act of writing his own name in the ledger of the dead, and the consumption of the lens itself. The ending feels both inevitable and magical.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot builds not through causal turns but through a deepening of resonant actions and images, from the bell's first ring to the gift of saffron.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Operating under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds pressure through deepening immersion rather than causal plot turns. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is an exceptional example of Conceptual Repricing combined with a Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara achieves her goal by becoming the object of her search, at the visible cost of her physical form.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. Each step—deciphering the lullaby, finding the shaft, freeing herself, escaping—follows a rigorous because/therefore logic. The ending provides a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she is free and has begun her work, reconfiguring the future's potential at the cost of her past imprisonment and her only weapon. The structure is tight, purposeful, and delivers a powerful, earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.7)

Orientation is established immediately and effectively. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s internal state decisively shifts, and the cost—embracing the vulnerability of staying—is made tangible in the final, resonant image of her carrying her "thawing heart carefully."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Causal-Hybrid structure effectively drives the narrative forward through a series of discoveries. However, the plot relies on a chain of convenient clues; the jump from decrypting smudged ink to finding "micro-grooves" spelling a safe combination on the same cast strains credulity and feels like an unearned leap. The closure, a Decisive Change where the brothers burn the contracts, is strong and lands with the felt cost of an erased past and an uncertain future.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural structure with flawless execution, building pressure through the cataloging of silences.

The closure is a powerful Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, occurring on the page with a clearly felt cost—the integration of trauma. The logic of the loop and its solution is flawless and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens beautifully. While a clear causal chain exists (eavesdrop -> find ticket -> decode -> reconcile), the story's power comes from the accumulation of atmospheric and symbolic weight. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration, where the characters achieve a new state of "Earned Stasis" or clarity, with the cost being the vulnerability of confession and the acknowledgment of past chill. The structure is perfectly contained and executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. Causality is built not on 'because/therefore' plot points, but on the resonant accumulation of Lira's storytelling, which methodically builds pressure on the queen and the garden. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen’s worldview is shattered (device cracks), she accepts Lira's way (takes the marble), and the garden confirms the shift (paths shorten). The cost is legible in the buried marble, a memory sacrificed to anchor the new truth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building emotional and atmospheric pressure toward a powerful closure. The ending is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lira's internal state is reweighted with a palpable, bittersweet cost ("victory tasted like thawed frost").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds pressure not through plot twists, but through a deepening of atmosphere and shared feeling, leading to a perfect Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The weighing of the smudged illustration makes the abstract stake—the mass of silence—tangible, providing a powerful and resonant closure with a clearly felt cost. The entire narrative is a single, perfectly calibrated arc of confession.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The structure is a masterclass in economy for this length, using a single continuous scene to build pressure toward a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.7)
    The structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens, following a clear ritualistic pattern: descent, passage, witnessing, and return. Closure is achieved through a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the keeper's cyclical duty is reaffirmed with the visible cost of his own entropy. The final sentence provides a perfect, resonant cadence shift, making the structure feel both complete and infinite.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to great effect, with the solar eclipse providing a natural, elegant structure that builds pressure toward a clear climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila leaves the curl and Rowan speaks, is emotionally earned and lands with a legible cost. However, the story is critically marred by the final, incomplete sentence fragment ("Years later..."). While the core closure unit is intact before this line, the fragment shatters the story's finality and reads as a significant editorial oversight rather than an intentional choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot builds through layered discoveries, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's purpose is transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is exceptionally tight and propulsive, from the discovery of the capsule to the burning of the film. The story uses a Causal lens perfectly, with each beat leading logically to the next. The Decisive Change at the end is powerful, though the immediacy and scale of its global effects ("a mayor confessed... two nations announced a truce") lean into fable, slightly softening the grounded realism of the build-up. This is a minor tonal shift, not a structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.6)
    The plot is a masterclass in conceptual causality under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The structure is tight, with each action logically escalating the confrontation, from laying down silence to forcing a choice. The closure—a Decisive Change with a visible, resonant cost (the shimmer transferring to the anchor)—is executed flawlessly on the page, feeling both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless. It builds pressure not through causal turns but through the increasing density of mapped memories.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story employs a hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens flawlessly, moving from a clear initial goal to an emotionally resonant Decisive Change. The structure is tight, with each beat escalating pressure toward the climax. The closure, where she throws the tablet, provides a definitive 'after' state with a deeply felt cost—the abandonment of hope for a 'fixed' past—and the final image reconfigures the opening beat with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Causality operates through ritual and resonance rather than plot mechanics, building pressure toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The ending provides on-page closure with a legible, felt cost—the re-experiencing of reversed memories—perfectly fulfilling the demands of its chosen narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) as its closure. The narrative drive is a hybrid of causal setup (being followed creates the problem) and an accumulative/textural resolution that redefines "integrity" with a powerful final image. The cost—relinquishing control and trusting an unknown future ("releasing a child to the unknown")—is keenly felt. This structure is sophisticated, confident, and perfectly suited to the story's length and philosophical aims.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds emotional and sensory density toward a clear climax—releasing the scent. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, reframing memory from a commodity to a living elegy, with the cost felt in Elian's tears for his past selves. The causality is emotional and sensory, and it holds perfectly from the inciting memory to the final resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative builds thematic and emotional weight through layered reflection rather than causal plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    This story is a masterclass in the Accumulative/Textural drive. It forgoes traditional causality for a series of resonant actions that build in density until they trigger a Conceptual Repricing at the close. The closure, marked by the tangible green shoot, is earned with the visible cost of the protagonist's former identity, making the before/after state change both legible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure builds through sensory and emotional density, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for the ending. The closure lands cleanly on the page, with the cost—the loss of Vale’s protective detachment—made tangible in the final image of the two characters connecting.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story fails the specified scope for its length, presenting a summary of months rather than one or two focused scenes. More critically, the plot's resolution hinges on a major coincidence—a sailor happening to find the locket and return it. While the emotional payoff is strong, the rubric explicitly states that coincidence may complicate but not resolve, making this a significant structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building from loneliness to shared creation. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing: Arbor’s tag isn't a destination but a catalyst, and the final resonant image of the singing arbor with its generations of offerings provides a profound sense of earned community with a felt cost—the shared "luminescent ache." The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot functions flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of resonant magical actions with consistent internal logic. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise; Lira achieves her goal, but the vision of the "empty city after the giant woke" introduces a profound future cost. This final reconfiguration of stakes is earned on the page and elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is a ritual, where each symbolic action accrues meaning, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Lira redefines ambiguous loss as “a corridor rather than a wall,” is earned and resonant, with the felt cost of abandoning the hope for a cure. This structure is perfectly suited to the story's introspective nature.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless narrative structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens at its close. The causal chain of the search (hunt, find, secure) is seamlessly interrupted by a situational trigger (the girl's arrival), which forces a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's goal. The closure lands with undeniable on-page cost—giving away the precious "lullaby II"—and the final image is charged with new meaning. Orientation is immediate and all plot elements serve the central purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where the escalating storm builds pressure that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara's stance shifts from rigid control to acceptance, a change made legible in the final images of the translucent leaf and the forgotten notebook. The cost—the surrender of her long-held illusion of control—is deeply felt and earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot is not a chain of causal events but a deepening of atmosphere and psychic pressure that culminates in a single, transformative transaction. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands beautifully; Ishka's final state of acceptance is earned by the preceding weight of imagery and her decisive trade. The cost—the relinquishing of the amber, a concrete link to the past—is tangible and gives the final image its power.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery rather than strict causality. The structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident (the unforeseen pearl) and a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The final image of the two walking into a "steadily unpredictable" dawn, with the cost of the clairvoyant's certainty paid on the page, is exceptionally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure, built on a series of resonant discoveries, effectively deepens the central stake of making meaning from absence. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration; the vision of sails doesn't solve the problem causally but re-frames the future and Mara's role within it. The final, unfinished sentence is a brilliant structural choice that embodies the ongoing nature of her work and lands with significant conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building a psychologically coherent journey from symbolic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight and effective Causal lens, with each beat logically leading to the next. The closure is a potent combination of a Decisive Change (the immediate sale is thwarted) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the conflict escalates to open defiance), landing with the clear felt cost of future repercussions. The structure is flawless for this length, though the final cut-off word feels like a slightly affected stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to perfection, building pressure through a countdown and atmospheric detail rather than causal turns. The structure is flawless for its length, driving toward a closure of Charged Poise that lands with precision and palpable cost.
