  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns gradually reweight Elara's understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases butterflies and commits to "unadorned" research. Cost is visible (career destroyed, home lost) but the final equations sketch feels slightly abstract compared to the embodied middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres around frost patterns revealing smuggler routes, building to Elara's decision to expose them through art. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - she emerges with clarified purpose. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; we understand she's endangered but don't see her pay a specific price for this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as individual silences weave into collective symphony, with visible cost in survivors' tears and grateful clasping. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from shipwreck trauma through conservatory arrival to musical transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias achieves the "chased stillness" through self-sacrifice, joining the quiet he pursued. The accumulative lens holds as souls gather, lens shards unite, and density increases toward the earned stasis, though the "impossible spaces" mechanism could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara formalizes the midnight runs, transforming anonymous survival into declared alliance—"survival into strength, anonymity into alliance." The accumulative structure coheres well with early orientation anchored by the first paragraph. The cost is felt through "amplified resolve" and the community's vow "to outlast any sanction," though the immediate price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where "love's storehouse was the heart's quiet archive" with healing as visible cost. However, the revelation that the old man is her past-life brother arrives without sufficient groundwork, creating a causality gap that undermines the ending's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through visions and sensory layering until the fragment's disintegration creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias is "forever changed by the texture he had touched." The cost is felt through his physical collapse and psychological transformation, though the mystical resolution mechanism ("incantations of release") weakens causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change closure with Elias breaking his chains and planting seeds, with visible cost shown through his years of imprisonment and the risk he takes evading guards. The causal chain from cipher discovery to seed vault location to planting is clean. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara creating a device that captures "the sound of trust breaking" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost. The orientation anchors (underwater greenhouse, post-apocalyptic setting) arrive clearly by ~120 words. However, the bracketed self-corrections at the end ("wait, that's over—trimming back mentally") break the narrative frame and undermine closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's transformation from thief to guardian), with the cost implied through her tears and the weight of destiny. The causal chain from flower code to portrait discovery to moonbeam revelation holds, though the jar's convenient appearance strains believability. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (station, twilight, Elara as thief).

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias abandons the unstable outpost to "scatter seeds across the waking world," with visible cost in leaving his forge behind. The accumulative lens holds through glass-orb creation and environmental decay converging at the departure, though the midpoint bookmark discovery could tighten its causal link to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change with Elara exposing Marcus and reclaiming agency, with visible cost in confronting her fabricated past. The causal lens holds through discovery→decryption→confrontation, though the seashell's sudden speaker capability strains credibility. Who/where/when anchors by ~120 words, and the single-scene structure maintains unity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara begins her mental map. However, the closure lacks visible cost—we see her "obsession sated" but no price paid or path foreclosed. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through looped timelines converging into Elara's expanded consciousness—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she's "forever changed yet eternally sweeping." The ice violin discovery triggers temporal perception loops that amalgamate experiences, building density toward the closure insight about thought's origin. Cost appears through "vulnerability," "suppressed curiosities," and the weight of "timelines converged," though the conceptual nature keeps it from full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias joins the exchange, with visible cost in his vulnerability ("locked chest opening"). The accumulative lens holds as cryptic doodles layer meaning toward connection, though the worldbuilding about wordless society feels slightly front-loaded without full integration into the pressure system.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden returns Elias's lost marble "mended by the vine's own resin," validating his belief that gardens know their gardeners. This closure carries felt cost through years of patient tending and the visible price of his "withered frame." The accumulative structure builds through ritual repetitions toward this crystallized moment where the Luckometer's "92.7" pales against organic reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing through the holographic proof of sideways time, but the cost remains abstract—"binding human curiosity to alien rhythms"—without concrete stakes or sacrifice. Causality is clear but mechanical: setup leads directly to demonstration without meaningful complication. The orientation is clean but the closure lacks felt human cost beyond scientific validation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's discovery and partial decoding of Isabella's message, with visible cost as the program disintegrates. The accumulative structure builds from atmospheric setup through discovery to revelation, with each beat deepening the ghostly presence. The closure lands with "a love betrayed, a voice forever silenced" reweighting the entire opera house's decay, though the final beat's emotional processing ("inspired no longer by mystery but by resolution") slightly abstracts what could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's decision to descend. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the final image of preparing to descend, but the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we understand she'll leave her sanctuary but don't viscerally experience what she's losing. The bracketed meta-commentary about word count disrupts the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's suppressed guilt about abandoning his brother surfaces in parallel to the ghost's confession, with the beaded valve as physical talisman of "shared folly." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the accumulative structure holds. The cost is felt but the ghost's appearance breaks causality - he materializes without sufficient grounding, and his confession arrives without dramatized pressure, weakening the closure's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the keeper's eternal witnessing in the obsidian refuge. The cost appears in "mending the weariness of untold drifts" and the abandoned library above. However, the swan's discovery feels convenient rather than earned, and the burrowing transition lacks concrete obstacle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Theo's transformation from grief-muted to wonder-budding, with the curl transfer marking decisive change. Causality flows cleanly from Elena's therapeutic intent through shared eclipse experience to Theo's awakening. The cost—Elena giving away her precious keepsake—is visible on page, though the piece leans heavily on thematic repetition ("ordinary magic," "dreaming roots") that slightly dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elowen's quest transforms from restoration to "dream anew in its wake," with visible cost in humanity's extinguished dreams. The accumulative structure coheres as historical layers converge in the final recognition. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with "reclaimed silo library" and "after the last human dream had been dreamt."

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes clear orientation and maintains causality through Elias's fortune-writing routine, but the closure—Maris reading the fortune and walking toward the sea—lacks visible cost or decisive change. The "transposition" remains conceptual without showing how lives actually alter. The Accumulative/Textural lens fits best given the layering of secrets and fortunes, but the final image doesn't sufficiently reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands with the possession defeated and Elias returning to vigilance (Earned Stasis), showing clear cost through "weight of guardianship." The causal chain holds throughout, but the resolution feels somewhat predetermined - the rhetorical devices work exactly as intended without meaningful complication or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias retrieves his childhood memories and "becomes the conductor," but the cost remains abstract. The nautilus mapping creates accumulative pressure effectively. The closure lands but lacks a visible price—exhaustion threatens but never claims anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("her self whole at last") but the cost remains abstract—"timelines fusing in a cascade of light" doesn't show what Elara sacrifices or loses. The labyrinth sequence follows causal linkage but the revelation that it's "her own creation" arrives without setup. Orientation anchors establish by ~120 words though the viaduct-to-labyrinth transition blurs spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's numbness transforms into renewed feeling through the accumulation of vibrations and reversed sound. The cost is visible in her tears and the "spent but victorious" needle. The accumulative structure coheres well, building texture through sensory detail toward the emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: storm recording leads to being followed, which leads to discovering the pigeon, which leads to understanding the conspiracy and choosing coded resistance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias commits to his path of "unyielding honesty" with the message tube as "talisman," accepting isolation as the price. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words, though the cost at closure relies more on conceptual weight than felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost—Elias finally grieves openly after understanding that "some scents wept for us." The causal chain from perfume vial to UV revelation to holographic projection of Elara's peace holds logically. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (greenhouse purpose emerges gradually) and the conceptual explanation becoming somewhat abstract in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece attempts a Accumulative/Textural lens with lyrical density, but closure fails to land decisively—Elias simply lets the rope fall without choosing, making "patterns unresolved" an abdication rather than Earned Stasis with cost. The orientation is adequate (poet, grotto, after beings arrive), but the stakes remain abstract philosophical musings about time's texture rather than concrete pressure. The meta-commentary in brackets about word count breaks the fourth wall and undermines any closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chronic hush transforms from oppressive silence to "softer now, laced with the beauty of tales unbound," with the mendicant's bowl accumulating stories as tangible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through water imagery and sound/silence patterns building to communal catharsis. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara completes her transformation from detached dealer to empathetic healer, with cost visible in her "subsuming" clients' pain and the dissolution of her professional barriers. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (amber light, static, scent) build toward the transformation moment. Minor deduction for the slightly overextended denouement after the transformation completes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership formed) lands with visible cost (resources committed) and the situational lens holds. The mistaken envelope creates genuine pressure that crystallizes their stances. Minor deduction for overly convenient resolution where all elements align perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's integration into the community, with visible cost in her vulnerability and effort. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details of search and sculpture-making layer toward belonging, though the resolution's emotional weight feels somewhat predetermined rather than dramatically discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's binding to the infinity loop, with visible cost ("the borrowed time demanded return"). The accumulative structure builds through canal navigation, time-borrowing ritual, and echo discovery. However, the mechanics of borrowing time and the interrupted cadence concept remain somewhat abstract, weakening causal clarity in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elowen reframes loss as "a new term, ambiguous yet integral." Cost is felt through the "years ago" weight and "echoes of laughter," though the transformation occurs primarily through magical revelation rather than earned struggle. The single-scene structure maintains coherence with clear who/where/when anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sense memories building to Elias's emergence and connection with the grieving woman—a Resonant Reconfiguration where his visibility replaces isolation. The tape fragment discovery triggers memories that reweight his purpose, leading to his first emergence in months (visible cost). Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the pattern of uncovering-caching-emerging holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's hybrid transformation, with visible cost (loss of pure human form) legible in the final image. Causality holds as electrical storms catalyze plant anomalies, leading to Elara's choice. The accumulative lens works—density increases through sensory detail until the transformation crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with rain trails leading to brooch discovery, then human convergence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's worldview shifts from isolated creation to "earnest exchanges that bound survivors," with visible cost (giving away the brooch). The sleep resolution provides earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elara's touch of the pearl triggering possession, and closure lands as a Decisive Change where she becomes the vessel for the cave's forces. The cost is visible—loss of self—though the mechanism of possession through "overlapping shadows" could be more physically grounded. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of the trumpet valve from symbol of silenced voices to instrument of renewal, with visible community cost (years of exile, hardened trust). The accumulative lens holds as fragments compile into meaning through "staggered intervals," though the vision sequence mid-story briefly suggests causal linkage before returning to textural accumulation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the ending image of tentative laughter against ivory stones carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal lens with clear closure - boarding the phantom train toward the Fortress constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost ("trembling certainty," "shatter and new starts await"). The orientation anchors early (route mapper, 3am, fog-shrouded street) and causality flows through discovered cracks → vault → punch → train. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of all elements in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through whale songs, tile vibrations, and memory convergence leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters find peace through shared vision. Orientation anchors clearly (tower, cliff, night). The cost—confronting buried grief—is felt but could be more visceral at closure. The final image of the "silent conductor" reweights earlier material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes clear causality through the solar storm enabling the amulet's power, leading to Elowen's vision of transformation after death. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds purpose in chasing storms), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"the void within her had cracked" lacks the visible price required for bands above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena inherits both formula and transformed understanding of her father, with visible cost (accepting his criminal legacy to find meaning). The closure lands with "carrying the weight of fair trade" - a clear before/after with emotional price. Slight deduction for the formula's abstract presentation without more concrete dramatization of its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure effect with visible cost. Elias's descent to the town with his "histories" promises transformation but delivers only abstract intention ("ready to illuminate its textures"). The plague setup creates stakes that dissipate into metaphysical musings about time rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught layering of overheard stories building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the wanderer's "death certificate error, once a void, now textured with these borrowed histories." The cost is legible—accepting permanent erasure while persisting through others' fragments. Orientation anchors (port, containers, tides) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elias carries the shell as "talisman of reimagined conversations," accepting rather than debunking mystery. The cello's hums retelling past conversations accumulate to reweight his myth-busting identity with visible emotional cost. Slight dock for the abstract "universal riddle" framing that doesn't fully concretize.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative structure builds from individual graffiti art to collective reorganization, with the foundation chip serving as both talisman and symbol. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the city votes "to incorporate on their terms," showing visible transformation with preserved identity. Cost is legible in the "desperate energy" and defensive preparations. Slight deduction for the somewhat summary-like final vote rather than a more visceral closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural drive builds through layered details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara captures/preserves the "dawning hush." The cost is felt through her vigil's physical toll and the melancholic weight of witnessing "the last" of something. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when established early), and the closure image of the preserved photograph carries emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the repaired drone carries "mended hope into the world," with visible cost in Elias's scarred hands and years of loss. The water refraction method pays off the blindness constraint meaningfully, though the Elysium's departure feels somewhat ornamental to the core repair arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition (condensation mimicking river paths) building toward discovery. Closure achieves a Charged Poise—Elias sets out toward the convergence point with "worrying tranquility" and destiny's pull, though the cost remains anticipatory rather than paid on-page. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated footsteps creating "balance restored through the unyielding patience of footsteps eternal," with cost implied in "just before the collapse." However, the transformation from ghost town to revival lacks concrete intermediate beats - we jump from empty streets to multiple returnees without showing the mechanism of their arrival. The accumulative lens holds but needs tighter linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the "gathered hush" phenomenon building through sensory detail to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara escapes by embodying the temple's "ephemeral grace." The vial becomes both catalyst and talisman, with visible cost in her near-death oxygen depletion. Orientation anchors (underwater temple, Elara, diving emergency) establish by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias threads his narrative into the lighthouse, transforming from carrying his father's burden to letting it "repose in truth." The accumulative structure builds through concrete images (copperlight, lattice, scuffs) toward this earned transformation. Minor orientation wobble with "hovering" memories and the slightly abstract handling of how stories physically alter the space.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through ephemeral appearances toward Elias's willing transformation. The closure lands with clear cost (his dissolution into her world) as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The bead serves as persistent constraint linking past and present. Minor orientation wobble with the grandmother's estate mention that doesn't fully integrate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the labyrinth transforming from "tomb of ruins into a living poem of reverence" through Elara's sewn paths. Cost is visible in the community's tentative-then-reverent gathering, though the magical sewing (needle piercing stone) strains credibility without taught rules. The accumulative structure coheres around the weaving metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's excavation building toward faith restoration, but the closure lands as summary ("her lost faith reignited—not in grand revelation, but in the quiet enchantment of continuity") rather than a dramatized moment with visible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of wandering and discovery but the final reconfiguration occurs in abstract declaration rather than concrete image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with dense imagery building toward Elias completing his chalk codes, but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending shows him turning toward the post chute with "weight of purpose," but this represents continuation rather than transformation—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered details about Elara's craft and discoveries until the final image of the eternal flame as "beacon for stories yet to be heard" reweights her role. Clear orientation established early (observatory, Elara as embroiderer, pre-coup timing). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara crystallizes her stance to expose the conspiracy with visible risk ("under cover of night").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms unsent letters into spiritual release, with clear emotional cost shown through tears and the metaphor of "healed heart." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and spirit songs build toward this moment of release. Minor weakness: the mechanics of how spiritual evocation actually sends the apology remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's quiet resolve, but lacks a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The orientation is clear, but the accumulative structure meanders without meaningful tightening - decrypting the notes doesn't alter options or force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's daydream journey building toward artistic renewal through discovery of the fresco fragment. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where he emerges "renewed, ready to paint again," though the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The nested daydream structure works but the meta-commentary at the end ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust for count") breaks the fictional frame and undermines closure integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation from certainty-seeker to curiosity-driven explorer, with visible cost in his abandoned notebook. The accumulative lens holds as reflected sounds layer into nested awakenings, though the mechanism of "bewitchment through sound" strains physical plausibility without clearer world-rule establishment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (cryptic language, warped gardens) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the greenhouse becomes "their bastion." Orientation anchors (2147, greenhouse, Thought Levy Act) land early. Cost appears in "tax-drones patrolling" and "enforcers raided" but remains more atmospheric than personally felt by Elias at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms her shell-prison into a "sanctuary of photosynthesized grace," with visible cost in her "centuries of longing." The accumulative structure coheres as density builds from isolated suffering through the postcard's arrival to the blossom armistice. However, the cost remains more declared than dramatized—we're told about "ache of lovers lost" and "verses rejected" but don't witness the specific price of this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elowen discovering and repairing the cracked bamboo tube, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she continues her vigil despite deepening regret. The cost is felt in "regret laced her every breath like foxglove's hidden poison" and the weight of thousands of names slipping away. However, the closure lacks a decisive shift—she simply continues what she was already doing, limiting the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands cleanly—trust literally reconstituted through magical binding with visible cost of vulnerability. The accumulative/textural lens holds as glyphs build into symphony, with each promise adding harmonic weight. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the single-scene structure maintains unity. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract ("promises to share dangers") rather than showing specific sacrifice, limiting entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias reconceives the surveyor's chain "not as a tool of division but of measured unity," with emotional cost visible in his trembling hands. The accumulative structure builds through discovery of the envelope, decoding its message, and final harmonization, though the conceptual resolution could be more dramatically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from "reinvented" forgeries to "authentically renewed" connections, with visible cost in his vulnerability to Mira. The accumulative lens holds as dust motes, pigeons, and songs layer toward meaningful restoration. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the meteorite-as-counterweight device effectively constrains his reinvention process.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara crosses back home by understanding necessary distances, with the cost of her long separation visible throughout. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (prisms, thresholds, distances) build toward the final crossing. Causality flows clearly from finding the logbook to intuiting the weather codes to arranging prisms. Orientation anchors solidly (Elara on the drifting terrace after the butterfly effect), though the mechanism of her return feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story reaches for Resonant Reconfiguration through synchronization but lacks visible cost—Elara simply "feels the pulse" without sacrifice or trade-off. Causality breaks when fireflies manifest underwater through unexplained "feather magic." The orientation is clear but the closure's "seamless shadowseam truth" provides resolution without dramatized price, failing the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through the bird's arrival and seed-sprouting, culminating in Elara's conceptual repricing about paths and permanence. However, the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"knowing discovery lay not in permanence, but in the scatter and the sprout" asserts transformation without showing what Elara sacrifices or risks by this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where monotony transforms into participatory magic, with the bishop piece as fulcrum and the crowd's dispersal "with smiles" marking visible change. The accumulative structure coheres as tokens scatter, reappear, and guide participants through orchestrated discoveries. Cost appears in Elias's "analytical satisfaction" and the effort of ordering chaos, though the emotional price could be more visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story presents a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's successful verse creation, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see completion without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative/textural lens fits the lyric mode, yet the transformation from exile to "bridge to infinite" lacks concrete stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; the verse simply succeeds without complication or earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias moving from dock to pond to atrium, building toward a Conceptual Repricing about mundane worth. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elias's "transformation" is asserted ("a man transformed") rather than demonstrated through sacrifice or foreclosed options. The orientation is clear but the piece reads more as extended meditation than dramatized change, missing the decisive alteration or renunciation that would validate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts closure through Elias sharing his story with Lena, but this reads as accumulative/textural rather than decisive change. The meta-commentary breaks ("Wait, that's over—adjusting narrative") severely damage causality and reveal the artifice. No clear cost is visible at the ending beyond tears, and the drive lens remains ambiguous between causal and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's creation of the mandala that "revitalizes" hope across timelines, with visible cost in the lost balloonist city and her father's death. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns literally accumulate into a visual algorithm, though the parallel timeline mechanism could be more clearly grounded in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory echoes and discovered artifacts build to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts rather than flees her burden—"no longer a burden to flee, but a map to follow." Cost is legible in "weight settled on her, heavier than the ivy outside," though the final beat could sharpen the price of this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the mirrors showing visions. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the borrowed heartbeat "pulses freely" at the end, suggesting transformation, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The closure lands but lacks the sharp edge of true consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's willing erasure from history as the price of peace, with clear causality from ritual preparation through signing. The closure lands with visible cost ("her voice fading from the annals of conflict"), though the ritual's mechanics could be more precisely established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's act of release, with visible cost (risking scrutiny of his empire). The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the final image of rain washing away evidence. Minor orientation wobble around "these very lowlands" lacks specificity but doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through echo releases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara unlocks her "own echoing soul" at cost of pursuit. The before/after is legible: from bound conformity to freed defiance with "shadows stirred in the city's distant towers" marking immediate danger. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost—"inevitable pursuit" needed more concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's reversal decision, with felt cost in abandoning his established craft. However, the resolution occurs entirely through reflection without dramatized present-action, and the orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story reaches for Accumulative/Textural closure through the wind destroying one structure while the moth wing remains "caught in a final, defiant loop," but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks sufficient cost legibility—we don't feel what Elara loses or gains. The orientation anchors (grotto above clouds, monarch migration) arrive clearly, but the piece relies heavily on description over dramatized pressure, with the wind's interruption feeling more coincidental than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where preserved names echo through the sanctum. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "forgiveness complete" and transformation, but the actual price of this preservation ritual never manifests concretely on the page. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara understands her delayed foresight is "a mirror, reflecting futures in hindsight to guide the present." The accumulative pattern of vine imagery, decay, and rewilding coheres at closure with visible cost (accepting her burden). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the dream sequence mechanics could be cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear linkage (discovery → alignment → covenant), but the closure lacks visible cost—Elias is "forever altered" without showing what he sacrifices or loses. The orientation anchors (Babylonian palace, astronomer, twilight) land early, but the magical transformation arrives without sufficient resistance or complication to create meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the music box's cellular memory creating a resonant reconfiguration that releases Thorne's resentment. Closure lands with visible cost (tears, shoulders slumping) as grace enables forgiveness. The reality-shifting frame adds texture but doesn't fully integrate with the central transformation mechanism, creating slight structural looseness.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through synchronized breathing that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where dream and reality merge. The closure lands with visible transformation ("the glass mountains now a part of him") and felt cost in the years of loss. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's mending act serving as the central throughline. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mended eye reveals "not rigid contracts, but the persistence of feisty hearts," but the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we see the ribbon used but not what Elias sacrifices by giving up this memento of his daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) as Elara steps into the orchard "ready to inherit the universe's secrets," with cost implied through "disquiet to come" and the asteroid being "lonely no more." The accumulative structure coheres through the cameo discovery → vision sequence → commitment to pursue, though the bathroom scene's philosophical breakthroughs feel somewhat mechanical rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara unlocks the Library and "initiates the rescues," with the diary's wisdom "harmonizing the discordant timelines." The causal chain from time traveler's arrival through renegotiation to rescue holds. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we're told about "composing closure from chaos" but don't see specific trapped souls freed or witness what Elara sacrifices to achieve this harmonization.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through carnival imagery building toward Elara's vow to "weave until the garden claimed them both." Closure lands as Charged Poise—options crystallized but cost not yet paid. However, the "garden of forgotten names" remains too abstract, and the final cost could be more visceral. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the rope's reconfiguration seals the temporal anomaly with visible cost (sweat, effort). Causal linkage holds throughout, though the magical mechanics feel somewhat convenient. The orientation anchors land cleanly early, and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration lands with the bloom of hush spreading outward and the beings withdrawing their intensity. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through examining crack patterns, whispering incantations, and the stone's transformation of ambient noise into focused hush. Cost is visible in "healed the caves and her weary soul."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara successfully rekindling the beacon, proving her belief about meaningful coincidence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through gathering shards and aligning star paths, with cost visible in the sustained effort against storms and doubt. However, the resolution arrives somewhat mechanically ("At last, under a rare clear sky") without a final complicating pressure that would deepen the earned quality of success.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through shadow measurements building to crystallized identity. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara commits to preservation work with visible cost ("weight of conjecture"). However, the piece lacks a decisive turn—shadow measurements confirm what Elara already knows, and her vow doesn't alter her existing role.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from aimless wanderer to "anchored in creation's unyielding spark," with the cost visible in months of failure and the risk of the performance. The causal chain from discovering the rag to creating the hybrid fuel to the final display holds coherently. The orientation anchors (wandering designer, fortress, dusk) establish by ~120 words. Deduction for the slightly overwrought prose that occasionally obscures the causal simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's tangential divination method reveals Thorne's transition path. The pause-driven structure creates pressure that culminates in her vision of his "gradual ebbing" toward purpose. Deduction for cost being more told ("tension in his shoulders easing") than viscerally felt, though the "scars would soften like pebbles worn by waves" carries poetic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final response about "stretching silences before they contract," which reweights the entire collection quest as resistance against confinement. The accumulative structure coheres through the gravity inversion mechanism. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the conceptual cost of choosing openness over safety lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with density increasing toward Lira's transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira shifts from loss-shadowed to smiling, with cost visible in her initial state and Elias's perpetual dedication. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The pattern of silence-as-comfort accumulates through concrete actions (mist release, noise monitoring) to earn the final teaching moment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a straightforward quest structure (search→find→claim) without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at closure. Elara touching the throne and having visions lacks visible cost—the ruby dissolves but this doesn't alter her options or force a trade-off. The meta-commentary about word count ("Wait, trim to fit; actual count will align in final") breaks the fictional frame entirely. No meaningful tightening of pressure occurs; she simply follows murals to the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's successful teaching moment where the companion "drew a shuddering breath," with cost visible in the "loaded emptiness" and severed connections. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadows encroach and retreat, building to the ring's activation. However, the companion's transformation occurs off-page without dramatized struggle, and the closure line "bridges burned to build better air" veers toward explicit thematic statement rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the literal transformation of pressure into diamonds, with visible cost implied through the "quantum talisman" she keeps. The causal chain from survivor to diamond-creator holds, though the quantum messages' mechanics remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing—Elias's illegitimate birth invalidates the bloodline and reframes him as "dynasty ender" by birthright rather than choice. The accumulative build through music, memory, and discovery coheres well, and the cost (dissolving estates and titles) is explicit. The piece maintains its textural lens throughout, though the revelation mechanics feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elowen transforms from withdrawn knight to "weaver" of possibility, with the unsnapped armor serving as visible cost/change. The accumulative structure builds through discovery of the program, pattern-tracing, and fruit-stabilization to earn the transformation. While the lens holds and closure lands with felt change, some middle transitions between mystical elements lack clear causality, and the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with dust patterns revealing hidden histories, building to Eliza's resolution to preserve Josiah's story—a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost visible in her "tentative mending." Causality holds through discovery sequence. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation ("quiet bloom") and orientation taking until ~150 words to fully establish the 1867 Reconstruction setting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands with Kael's return creating a Decisive Change, but the cost remains abstract ("fog of apathy"). The causal chain holds until the convenience of Kael's emergence, which undermines the earned quality. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the prophecy dissolves into silence through Elias's musical intervention, with felt cost in "dewdrops glistened like tears of release." The accumulative lens holds as atmospheric elements (mist, dewdrops, prisms) build density toward this transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (grotto, dawn, Elias), and the single-scene structure maintains coherence. Cost could be more visceral at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through monument-building and leaf-decoding that culminates in Elara's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (her orderly nature "laced with poetic intuition"), though the transformation's speed slightly strains credibility. The piece teaches its pattern early with the falling leaves as messages.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Solid structure with clear orientation and escalating coincidences that build situational pressure. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias moves from rigid timekeeper to embracing the compass rose's "uncertain guidance." The cost is visible: he's committed to abandoning his ordered life for an unknown path.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elarion's transformation of regret into "luminous acceptance" via the kintsugi ritual, with visible cost in his tears and trembling. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through alchemical imagery toward the final reweighting. Orientation anchors clearly (foundry, post-search, Elarion alone), though the closure's "ready to seek her anew" feels slightly soft without specifying how his transformed stance changes his search tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure as Thorne achieves peace through integrated laughter, fulfilling the RR form with visible cost in his "bittersweet" joy and permanent loss. The orientation anchors (Echo Gorge, sunrise, Elara as collector) establish by ~100 words, and causality holds as the harp's distorted notes compel confession leading to healing. The cost feels somewhat abstract ("luminous ache") rather than sharply specific, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elias crystallizes his path forward with the equation metaphor while the UV forest promises continued suffering. The causal chain from escape to forest to deliberate trauma-triggering to insight works, with visible cost in his physical and emotional pain. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3, and the lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara unfastens the seal and releases the overlooked histories, with visible transformation in the market's response. The accumulative structure builds through memory layers and symbolic discoveries, though the cost—while conceptually present in her father's sacrifice—could be more viscerally felt in Elara's present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fatally breaks its own narrative frame with explicit word-count adjustments and revision notes ("No, recount properly. Actually, the ledgers showed embezzlement"). These meta-interruptions destroy causality and prevent any coherent closure from landing. The piece literally revises its own ending multiple times on the page, making it impossible to identify a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from motivation through frost patterns to bottled whisper to library's transformation achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (library's destruction). The piece anchors who/where/when immediately. Final image of "captured essence of all time" crystallizes the cost of achieving eternity through destabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where archaeological dispute transforms into unified myth through Elias's poetic devise. The accumulative structure coheres around the storm ceremony as focal point. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - the transformation lands intellectually but lacks immediate emotional price that would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change closure where Elias successfully repairs the covenant and restores light to the world, with visible cost in the "rust flaking away" and "midnight's veil tore." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building density through resonance chamber descriptions and tinkersong motifs that culminate in transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph, and the single-scene structure maintains coherent causality from problem through resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the compass transforms from artifact to "new vial," expanding Elara's collection beyond scent to "awakenings hinged forever to the mystery below." The accumulative structure builds effectively through descent, discovery, and vision. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (factory context comes late in paragraph one) and the vision sequence relies on convenient mystical revelation rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the magical visions building to Elara's sculptural response. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when her carving reforms the alliances, though the cost (storm easing, tears of revelation) feels asserted rather than dramatically earned. The GPS failure setup creates situation but the causality between carving and alliance-repair reads as magical convenience rather than motivated consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through postcards, cathedral visits, and gradual revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara understands both her grandmother's life and her own artistic drive. The closure lands with emotional cost ("tears blurred the glass") and transformed understanding, though the accumulation could benefit from more resistance or complication in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the diary's revelation "freeing her from the trap," but cost remains abstract ("renewed purpose skyward") rather than visible. The retrocognitive trap mechanism creates causal linkage, yet the resolution through beach debris arrangement feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes orientation clearly and maintains causal linkage, but closure arrives through summary rather than dramatized change—ships simply "arrived" and the cove "stirred once more" without showing the actual revival process or its costs. The Accumulative lens fits the meditative pace, yet the ending jumps to resolution without depicting the promised transformation's actual mechanics or difficulties.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward Elias's acceptance of emotional vulnerability—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("guarded heart"). The childhood memory anchors causally to present action through the phonograph shaving. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the cost remains somewhat abstract ("etched forever in the scribe's soul") rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara stabilizes the vortex and discovers time's "velvet rasp" texture, with visible cost in the melting ice promising renewal. Causality flows cleanly from egg-hatching through seed-planting ritual to vortex reopening. The orientation anchors (icebound atrium, Elara as seed saver, post-hatching chaos) establish by line 3, and the accumulative lens holds as density increases toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias chooses the bell, transforming routine duty into "serene wisdom." Cost is implied through the "gentle warning" reaching villagers, though more concrete stakes would strengthen this. The accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through cosmic imagery, but closure arrives as philosophical insight ("flourishing stillness") without visible cost or foreclosed path. The yellow lantern glass discovery creates texture but doesn't meaningfully tighten options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's traced gesture realigns the covenant. The ghosts' visibility creates the inciting pressure, and the stained glass box discovery provides meaningful escalation. Closure lands with felt cost as "the oasis breathed, a faint hum rising." Minor deduction for slightly abstract covenant mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - Elias achieves "suddenly timeless" existence where "his borrowed ledger erased." The accumulative structure coheres through the capsule discovery → decoding → reconstruction sequence, with cost visible in Mira's preserved "mosaic of joys and regrets." The post-Reckoning worldbuilding occasionally obscures immediate causality but serves the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kite string snapping creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where loss becomes liberation, with emotional cost visible in "heart catching." The accumulative structure coheres through the "woven dawns" metaphor, though the final paragraphs over-explain the thematic resolution rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the orchard's transformation extends to Elias himself ("six became twelve"), with visible cost in his laborious work under terminal diagnosis. The accumulative lens holds as copper wire patterns build toward the discovery of the hidden chamber and final interconnected state. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of the envoys as "mirrors" and her understanding of homecoming as "rebellious fusion." The amber discovery and envoy materialization create meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual ("skepticism luminous, rebellion academic no more") without fully dramatized stakes or visible sacrifice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the first sprouts piercing wood and the harmony resurfacing, showing visible transformation with clear cost (the reef's death, battlefield scars). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through seed-scattering to sprouting, though the piece could anchor "who" more clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Harlan's acceptance that "no grand reunion awaited" while finding Elara's presence "in every cracked vista," with the leaf transformed from memorial to "talisman against isolation." The accumulative lens holds as details layer (phonograph discovery, riddle solving, tinted revelations) to reweight his understanding. Cost is felt in accepting permanent separation while gaining connection through echo. Minor deduction for slightly rushed revelation sequence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara merges past and present sketches, with emotional cost visible in tears and the transformation of isolation. However, the revelation mechanism through the compass rose's "hidden family secret" feels mechanically convenient, and some causal links strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes clear stakes (corrupted chess pieces fracturing reality) and builds through accumulative pressure as Elias swaps each piece, with spectral guardians escalating opposition. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the board hummed to life" and "the sky righted itself," showing visible cost through Elias's ordeal. The accumulative structure holds, though the resolution feels slightly swift for the buildup's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara performing a ritual to unbind a spectral archive. While the pattern-walking spell provides structure, the closure lacks decisive cost—the unbinding succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or transformation beyond acquiring knowledge. The "chronicle of small gestures" remains conceptual rather than demonstrating how these gestures actually "unbound them all."

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elowen's nightly visions building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from seeker to "architect" of memory. Closure lands with "the seer reborn" seeding stories for others, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The pattern of stone-reading through feather texture accumulates pressure, but the final integration of "painful remembrances" into forward momentum feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's self-forgiveness begins unwinding the village curse ("a single villager's eye twitched"), with clear causal linkage from decoding tapestry → finding labyrinth → confronting self → thawing freeze. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern accumulation (chess metaphors, woven threads, platinum maze) builds to the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible but could be sharper—the "whispered absolution" moment needs more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration through the poetry sessions that "refract" single truths into spectrums of understanding, with cost visible in bearing "the weight of all those splintered truths." However, the actual ritual threat never materializes on-page, and the closure lands as Charged Poise rather than decisive change, with the canyon's echoes "softening" but no clear before/after transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with memories quilting into wholeness through pockmark-matching ritual. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms "uncertainty into profound, golden certainty" with the workshop steadying—visible cost in confronting painful memories. The orientation anchors clearly (workshop, acid sea, alchemist) and causality holds as each memory builds toward transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through discovery of the oasis and shell painting as closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the painted shell becoming talisman and inspiration, with cost visible in "temporary eternities glimpsed and lost." Who/where/when anchored early. Causality holds but the "wrong turn" convenience and lack of concrete obstacle weakens escalation linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Harlan's spectral guidance—"a warmth bloomed in Elias's mind, not words, but a knowing." Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2. The accumulative build through scent and intention pays off, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias transforms from isolated navigator to "sentinel, piecing solace from the night" through building the cryptic call network. The accumulative lens holds as midnight calls layer into a "web" of reverse migration guidance. Cost is visible in "raw solace—not erasure of loss, but a navigation around it" and the elder's acknowledgment. Minor orientation debt: the exact coastal location remains vague beyond "crumbling cliffs."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the glass eye's transformation from buried relic to implanted solution, with clear cost paid through self-surgery. The pattern of truth-telling established early pays off when Elias gains "measured words" to foster psychological safety. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors arrive late in paragraph one) costs −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias pins the flower to his lapel, accepting connection through shared isolation with visible cost ("witnessed isolation felt shared now"). The accumulative build through memory fragments works well. Deduction for the late reveal that the stranger sailed away rather than jumped—this retroactive reframing slightly weakens the established stakes of "the sea's embrace."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from ants to chip to map to cavern, with rising creek creating genuine time pressure. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias steps through the doorway with visions flooding him, options crystallizing. Cost is felt through the abandoned solitude and rising waters. Minor orientation wobble in the cavern descriptions but recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through a Decisive Change (curse broken, stars stabilized) with clear causal linkage from dreams to grotto to resolution. The "queen reborn yet forever marked" ending carries felt cost, though the mechanics of the incantation that "sealed the bleeding flow" remain vague, weakening the closure's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration through the shell's transformation, with emotional cost visible in their "renewed pact." However, the piece operates more as accumulative/textural than causal—the transformation arrives through ritual rather than earned pressure, and the "great rift" backstory remains vague despite being the central wound.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered dream imagery and recurring motifs (grave, soaring, past selves) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where jealousy transforms into acceptance. The closure lands with felt cost—the acknowledgment that past selves are gone but can be transformed through narrative. Early orientation is clear (mountain cabin, dream chronicler), and the birch bark scroll provides a concrete anchor for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered metaphors and the screw's transformation. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when polishing the screw reveals "renewal" and Elara leaves lighter, but the cost remains largely conceptual—loss processed through metaphor rather than a concrete price paid or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's ritual transformation. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars become stories, though the cost ("the crystals dissolving into luminous dust") reads more as relief than price paid. The transformation occurs on-page but lacks the sharp edge of genuine loss.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's delivered apology and "bittersweet spark" of reconnection, with visible cost in the archive's imminent destruction. Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage from guilt to action to reconciliation. Orientation anchors (archive, Elara, spectral brother) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where illusions shatter to reveal "unified cosmos, bare and true," with the dictionary serving as the key to this transformation. The spiral arbitration concept provides causal linkage through the middle section. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the "universe's hiccup" framing creates orientation ambiguity that isn't fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the reversal sequence, building to a Conceptual Repricing where clocks measure "quiet cuts of existence." However, the cost remains largely abstract—"the weight of understanding light as mist" doesn't provide felt consequence. The orientation is clear (fjord station, after whistle) and the pattern accumulates, but the transformation lacks dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elara discovers the farm's quantum network and releases her brother's ghost through understanding "release through connection, not isolation." The cost is legible in "the hollow space within" finally addressed. Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkage from intrusion alert through discovery, though the bracketed meta-commentary at story's end disrupts closure clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms grief into understanding, with visible emotional cost ("Tears welled"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of scrawls building toward revelation. Deduction for orientation softness—the subway scene relationship to present action remains somewhat unclear—and for cost that feels more stated than dramatized in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the glass harmonica's haunting melody creating density that reweights Clara's relationship with estrangement. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Clara's resolve hardens to release rather than reconnect, showing cost. However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—the conversation's "spiral" is told rather than shown through specific beats that would make her shift inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern-building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara commits to renewing the covenant. However, the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we're told about "weight" and "haunted euphoria" but don't see what Elara sacrifices or risks. The orientation is clear but the story relies heavily on reflection (>40%) without sufficient present-moment anchoring or micro-choices that alter current options.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as rumor chains and polite exchanges build toward the tower discovery and shared moment of connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias recognizes the cure lies in reciprocal sharing, not the rock itself, with the cost of his continued wandering visible. The piece teaches its pattern of rumor-spreading early and pays it off, though the midnight time shift feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara finds the stillpoint and absorbs forgiveness through her skin, with visible emotional cost paid throughout the journey. The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns intensify toward this crystallization, though the orientation takes slightly long to anchor the ultrasonic forest's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara uses the pen to edit her past mistake, with the anomaly responding approvingly as "gravity tugged playfully." The causal chain from regret to discovery to action is clear. However, the cost remains mostly abstract—we see visions of success but not what this timeline alteration actually costs Elara in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through silence-mapping leading to musical translation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias moves from forgotten isolation to meaningful connection, with emotional cost visible in "smiled through tears." However, the rapid progression from concept to public performance lacks intermediate steps, and the fishermen's unanimous wonder response feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara claims the codex and vows to continue Lirael's mission, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The causal chain from tapestry to mural to portrait to codex functions mechanically, and the meta-commentary about word count ("But wait, that exceeded; adjust") breaks immersion entirely, violating basic craft standards.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Elara becomes guardian of their entangled world. The cost is visible in the bittersweet acceptance that the dream lives "if only in her, a shared ghost under starlight." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words, though the speculative elements require some parsing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change: Marco's rescue proves Elias's whisper method superior to shouting, with visible cost in Marco's humiliation and Elias's "calculated spontaneity" paying off. The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from storm disruption to Marco's wager to Elias's rescue. Orientation anchors (port, containers, storm) land within first 120 words. Cost is legible in Marco's dazed state and the power reversal, though could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara finds solace through the guardian's light patterns. The transformation is present but lacks sufficient on-page cost—Elara watches patterns form but doesn't sacrifice or risk anything tangible. The orientation is clear (dock, mist, evening) and the single-scene structure coheres, but the closure's emotional weight relies on assertion rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves an Accumulative/Textural closure through synchronized window displays that accumulate into town-wide questioning, with the magnetic grotto amplifying unspoken doubts into "a chorus of potential." The cost appears conceptually in citizens beginning to question authority ("a child questioning curfew, a merchant rethinking alliances"). However, the personal cost to Elias remains abstract, and the elders' dismissal prevents full pressure crystallization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with the scrimshaw discovery triggering escalating revelations about Elara's nature, culminating in a Decisive Change where she transforms and abandons her human life. The closure lands with clear cost as she "detaches from the dock worker's facade" and dives into the deep, though the magical mechanics of the transformation could be slightly more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's theatrical narration transforming grief into "tentative release," with visible emotional cost in the sister's memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the whittling scene, though the worldbuilding backstory somewhat dilutes present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara crossing sacred boundaries, with the world "remade in softer, boundless beauty." The accumulative lens holds as patterns intensify toward closure. Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt - the "lover's sigh" and "gathering dawn" feel unearned against the stakes of crossing sacred boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught flower language building toward the glass concertina's creation and awakening exchange. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with both artists transformed through the barter, though the magical mechanics of "bartered awakenings" remain somewhat abstract rather than physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's simulated journey accumulating sensory memories that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she internalizes connection. The closure lands with "texture of bonds...enduring beyond the grid's fragile hum" showing conceptual cost. However, the virtual pilgrimage framework undermines stakes since nothing physically changes, and the brother revelation arrives late without sufficient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds renewal through teaching another. The observatory's time-bending properties and the discovery of the vellum stencil build toward the final scene where helping Lira transforms both women. Cost is visible in tears and "grief softening." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the observatory's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through "reverse engineering chaos" yielding "profound reconnection," but this lands primarily through abstract declaration ("they found not just survival, but a profound reconnection") rather than a concrete image with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds but the closure's conceptual cost remains asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through atoms of nostalgia that culminate in transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara accepts the paradox that innocence's end enables wisdom, with cost visible in her being "forever marked." The orientation anchors (archive, historian, quest) establish early and the single-scene structure maintains coherence. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the final cost—"forever marked" could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds density through library imagery and shadow work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope transforms from fragment to bloom with "luminous regret" as felt cost. Causality tracks cleanly from observation to intervention to preservation. The closure lands with visible transformation ("shadow settled into a new bloom") though the "momentary victory" undercuts permanence slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece establishes orientation clearly but lacks a genuine on-page closure with visible cost—Elias's transformation is declared rather than dramatized through a decisive action. The chameleon tail regeneration serves as extended metaphor but doesn't create actual stakes or force a consequential choice. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the density increase doesn't reweight the dominant stake with felt cost at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the discovery of the opal and final realization. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her survival's meaning, with felt emotional cost ("Tears came, opening the emotional wound"). Orientation anchors (tower, dawn, post-surgery) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara recognizes herself in Theo's stored love and commits to freeing it. The accumulative structure builds effectively through psychometric visions. Cost is present but primarily conceptual—the "vowing to unearth those letters" lacks immediate dramatic weight. The piece teaches its pattern early and maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal progression from arrival through instrument use to breakthrough. Orientation anchors quickly with clear who/where/when. Single scene structure fits scope perfectly with one meaningful tightening as she shifts from external searching to internal surrender. Closure lands on page with decisive change and visible cost under consistent causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through "wave functions" and "fractured lullaby" building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's void gains sparks. Cost is legible in the "dreamless curse unbroken" persisting even as cultivation succeeds, creating genuine trade-off between personal wholeness and world-renewal mission.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through translocations and wind-listening, culminating in Elias reclaiming his "wild frontier" at the rainforest's core. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration ("thoughts cascading like waterfalls over pistons, free and fierce"), though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we see the result but not the specific price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (veils, mist, indirect paths) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara claims her courage and transforms into a guide. The closure lands with visible cost—the dissolution of her fear-tether—and the star-stamp ritual provides a concrete throughline. Some middle passages meander without tightening pressure, and the orientation takes until line 7 to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the piano bolt discovery serving as the decisive deepening that reweights Elias's understanding of silence. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as he accepts silence as "vow" rather than curse, with cost visible in the choir's dissolution and his permanent voicelessness. The pattern of silence/sound imagery coheres throughout, though some backstory passages could integrate more smoothly with present action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Varak dissolves and cosmic balance restores, with visible cost in his "graceful dissolution." The causal chain from cryptic messages to collective revelation to confrontation holds cleanly. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. Deduction for the somewhat convenient gathering of seekers and the slightly abstract nature of the "rune's influence" spreading.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing (paths haven't disappeared but shifted) but the cost remains abstract - we see Elara smile but no felt price for the years of searching or what this discovery means for her future choices. The accumulative build works but lacks the decisive reconfiguration with visible stakes that closure requires.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from passive stargazing to active rebellion coordination, with the stone circle enabling this change. However, the cost remains abstract ("storms to come") rather than viscerally felt on the page—we don't see what Elara sacrifices or risks by choosing to reignite the rebellion. The accumulative lens holds but the final bracketed meta-comment about word count breaks the fictional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the embryo's discovery and unsealing. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the embryo's awakening reweights the reconstruction from physical to spiritual/societal rebirth with visible cost (shattering tradition). Orientation anchors early (volcanic hot springs, reconstruction, Elder Mira), and causality holds through plant-guided discovery to deliberate unsealing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final acceptance of "optimism anchored in realism," with visible emotional cost. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on reflection (approaching 35%) and the pearl metaphor is over-explained rather than dramatized. The orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered metaphors toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms through the ritual of untangling threads. However, the cost remains primarily metaphorical rather than visceral—we see him "emerging transformed" but the actual price paid (beyond time and effort) lacks concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes clear orientation and follows causal logic through the raid-investigation-discovery sequence, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply "uncovered the why" without paying a price or facing a meaningful trade-off. The final revelation about time slowing as "cosmic mercy" arrives as exposition rather than earned through dramatized action, and the bracketed meta-commentary disrupts the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain from discovery to transmission creates a Decisive Change with legible cost - Elara transforms from passive guardian to active revolutionary. The closure lands with "a conversation begun in silence," showing the irrevocable nature of her choice. However, some backstory segments ("flashed to her youth") slightly dilute present-moment pressure, and the world-building about "cryogenic elite" could be more grounded in immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Solid accumulative structure building to the dome crack crisis with clear closure through Earned Stasis. Elara's refusal of violence and persistence with her pacifist method results in the dome's stabilization, with the cost of her solitary commitment legible on the page. Causality holds under the accumulative lens, though some transitions between backstory and present action feel loose.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias catching the divine echo and mending his fractures, with visible cost in the "weight of eternity" he must bear. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sonic patterns break and reform, building to the final harmonious stillness. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches a Decisive Change when Elara exposes Quill's hoax, but the cost remains abstract—we see his eyes widen but no concrete consequence. The proof by contradiction with the pen nib provides causal linkage, yet the revelation arrives too cleanly without intermediate pressure. Opening orientation is clear but the shift from journalist's call to observatory visit lacks transitional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's tethering of the amber transforms her guilt into peace, with felt emotional cost visible in her weeping. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation takes until ~150 words to fully anchor the laboratory setting and Elara's role.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the mandala's creation, transforming chaos into "emergent hush" with the cost legible in the persistent "lilac unease" and "fragile" peace. The accumulative lens holds as patterns literally accumulate in sand, though the opening orientation takes until "whispering grotto" and "community" to fully anchor the collective situation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the renaming ritual serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—the plaza transforms from wound to sanctuary with visible cost (Elara's deeper entrapment that becomes "a tool now, not chains"). The orientation anchors (ancient plaza, after the fire) establish context early. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression through the ritual steps without enough pressure variation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Eliza and the ghost's "intertwined echoes" create mutual fulfillment—his encore granted, her despair lifted through shared artistry. The fractured timeline concept meaningfully constrains the ghost's existence and enables the resolution. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract treatment of "possibilities flickered like fireflies" without more concrete cost visualization.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the couple discovering somatic connection as replacement for telepathic pills, with visible cost in Theo's abandoned pharmaceutical pursuit. Causality flows cleanly from shock to awareness to artistic experiment, though the transition from problem to solution feels slightly rushed in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transitions to herald, but the cost remains abstract ("ensuring that when humanity stirred") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering, though the fossil's discovery feels convenient rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through button cataloging that builds toward the prophecy's unscrambling. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms the fixed prophecy into interpretable branches ("choose not the foretold, but the alive") and shares it with villages. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus arrives and they decode together, with visible cost in their "broken bond" being bridged. The accumulative lens holds as atmospheric details build toward this reunion. Orientation anchors cleanly establish Elara at Zephyr Bluff in early spring, with her spy past providing context.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's reframing of his ancestral vow, with cost visible in his release of "endless vigils that chained him to the gloom." Causality weakens in the middle third where reflection dominates action, and the fog's convenient thinning in response to his realization strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the thrumming glass visions building to a Conceptual Repricing about resistance through kindness. The closure lands with Elias's understanding that "places resisted change not through stubbornness, but through the quiet thrum of sustained compassion" - a genuine reweighting with implied cost in his own need to resist unraveling. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise as Elara transforms loss into "quiet strength" and envisions a shared garden, with clear cost in releasing the father's rose petals. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from garden to harbor, with the "quivering hush" serving as the pivotal cadence shift that reweights her relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through sundial discovery → stone circle activation → spectral communion, with Resonant Reconfiguration landing as Elara transforms isolation into independence. The cost is felt in "memories now integrated, not burdensome" and her first flight in ages. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the spectral manifestation mechanism could use stronger causality.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery of spirals, threads, and connections. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transitions from "keeper of secrets" to "part of the kept," with emotional cost visible in her tears and the reweighting of her ghostwriting work. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's interference creates "the first honest silence in weeks," with cost visible in Harlan's physical staggering and the community's "wary clarity." The causal chain from signal detection through interference to disruption holds, though the cosmic tricksters remain somewhat abstract. Orientation anchors (university radio station, Eldridge, Elara as interpreter) establish by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves closure through Elara obtaining the Keystone and emerging "changed," but the cost remains largely abstract—"ready to redraw the world's boundaries" tells rather than shows consequence. The causal chain from descent to discovery feels convenient; the compass point's divining abilities and the organ's guidance system appear without sufficient setup. The orientation is clear but the resolution's ease undermines earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's sketch reveals the killer's identity through empathy rather than recognition, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with methodical investigation building toward insight. However, the closure lacks visible stakes - we never see what Elara risks or loses, and "knowing this unification would lance the case's heart when presented to the skeptical detective tomorrow" defers consequence off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from weather station establishing shot through archive work, nail discovery, decoding process, to posthumous redemption - each beat deepening Elara's quest. The closure (reversible redemption achieved, nail as talisman) lands with felt cost through "wept into the fog." Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical final paragraph's thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering the flake, interpreting the scaffold wraps as a map, and finally playing on the ancient arch - a Resonant Reconfiguration where he transforms from mourning "crossings never made" to actively bridging possibilities. The hitchhiker's vanishing catalyzes but the cost lands through Elias confronting his scarred-hands origin story. Some orientation wobbles early (the hitchhiker context is thin) but who/where/when anchors sufficiently by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through territorial markers and circular imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias understands paths "circle back." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—the line "to harmonize the echoes of fathers and sons" gestures toward meaning without showing the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara understands the temple inscriptions' meaning about shared burdens, but the cost remains purely conceptual without visible stakes. The accumulative structure coheres around dream-vision imagery, yet the transformation from ignorance to understanding lacks dramatized friction or sacrifice that would make the "before/after" truly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elowen's "unbend" transforms both the vortex and herself, with visible cost in accepting the truth of the sorcerer's shame. The accumulative lens holds as expanding circles build toward this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly (druid, lake, vortex established immediately). The cost is somewhat abstract ("deepened by the battle won within") rather than viscerally felt, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the eclipsed covenant "shone anew" after Elara bridges temporal scars. The cost is visible through her "wilted but fulfilled" maze clipping and the permanent alteration of her scarred patterns. Orientation anchors (cobalt glade, dusk, tree-being) establish by ~100 words, and the pattern of linking/convergence builds density toward the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration where both souls exchange wounds for wholeness, with visible cost as the tarot card crumbles to dust. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery and meaning deepen toward the bartered exchange. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the middle section's pacing stutters slightly with repetitive philosophical exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Jack's emotional state deepening through layered reflections, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he reframes his purpose. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"tomorrow, he'd return to appraising" lacks the immediate, felt price that would elevate the closure, and the shift from despair to resolve happens through interior realization rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through analogical thinking building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finding peace through the seed-planting ritual. The closure lands with emotional cost (accepting the mentor's absence) and conceptual reweighting (transition as reconfiguration rather than loss). However, the cost could be more visceral; the transformation from haunted ambition to quiet resolve happens too smoothly without a decisive struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the librarian's successful preservation of migrating identities, with visible cost in the dissolution of individual smelts into narrative essence. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered imagery. The orientation anchors (tidal atrium, post-tomorrow world, librarian's nature) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the pearl's integration with the cave, transforming bunker to sanctuary with visible cost in the abandoned hopes absorbed. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the crystalline transformation, though the mechanics of how the pearl actually changes the space remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering map references and graffiti that reweight his past, culminating in playing the accordion as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt on the page, and the closure lacks the decisive weight needed—the final image of him leaving with the accordion doesn't sufficiently crystallize what has changed beyond intention.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain from letter to cipher to coordinates to library follows clear because/therefore logic, but the closure lacks visible cost - she simply receives what she sought. The library discovery reads as fulfillment without sacrifice or trade-off, missing the required decisive change with felt price that would make this publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara chooses the dream path with visible cost (forsaking empire archives). The ice violin's revelation through plant telepathy provides causal tightening. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation ("mended horizon," "purposefully porous") rather than more concrete imagery at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elara successfully infuses her essence into the emerald chip before oblivion claims her, with visible cost (her death) on the page. The accumulative structure builds coherently through ritual preparation to final transformation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the curse's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara shifts from "chasing an elusive source" to finding "contentment as the quiet rhythm of care amid rebirth's dance," with emotional cost visible in her tears. However, the brother's betrayal and the grotto's initial damage lack concrete dramatization, weakening the foundation for this earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting from binary thinking to nuanced understanding with the symbolic unhooking action. The causal chain from hiring Thorne to interpreting chimes to releasing doubt coheres, though the transformation mechanism feels somewhat mechanical. Cost is implied through "protected vulnerable bloom" but lacks concrete dramatization of what Elara sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ripple patterns revealing insights about aging reversal. However, closure lacks a decisive change—Elara rises with "motivation reaffirmed" but no visible cost or foreclosed path. The warning about "full vanishing into the magnetic unknown" remains theoretical without an on-page choice that tests it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara achieves her goal of unmoving navigation, with visible cost in her "eternal vigil" and being "unbound." The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery building to this transformation. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the cost, though "the world would come to her" and "eternal vigil" make the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Accumulative structure coheres around the sacred/simple theme but the closure lacks visible cost—Elowen simply places the keystone and experiences revelation without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early but the "tears froze on her cheeks" moment reads as emotional assertion rather than earned transformation through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's discovery of sound's color, with clear cost in years of deferred dreams now redeemed. The causal chain from key tag discovery to library exploration to orb revelation holds well. The closure lands with "authentic resonance" as he carries the secret forward, though the middle section could tighten the connection between the lantern release and his decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara casts away the coins to achieve alignment, with visible cost (losing her divination tools) that enables rebirth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through static bursts building to the alignment moment, though the "whisper of doubt" in the final line slightly undermines the cost's finality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's heartbreak transforms into purpose through crystallizing fears into guardians. The cost is visible in "tears tracing paths" and the shift from "wound" to "beacon," with the accumulative lens holding throughout as density increases toward the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change closure with the bell's restoration triggering the sea's return, and causality flows logically from discovery through method to resolution. The drive lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkage. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "brittle devotion" being tested but don't see Elias sacrifice anything tangible, and the resolution arrives too easily given the cosmic scale of the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's act of communal healing, with visible emotional cost ("tears mirrored in eyes"). The causal chain from photographs to family revelation to reconciliation action holds, though the transformation speed strains credibility. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the starling murmuration that reweights Elara's understanding. Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise as she achieves "balance: logic tempered by wonder" with visible emotional cost (tears, loosened hair). The transformation threat establishes early stakes that tighten through experimental failures to the ritual's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong causal lens with clear closure—Elara's revision of the log prevents defensive misfire and preserves trust, with cost visible in her isolation and burden. The orientation anchors (nocturnal arbor, sky colonies, pattern seeker role) establish cleanly by ~120 words. Deduction for cost being somewhat abstract rather than showing specific sacrifice or loss; the "burden lingered" doesn't fully dramatize what she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal progression from infiltration to ritual to vivification with clear because/therefore linkage. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (emotions flooding back) and the drive lens holds throughout. Orientation is established early enough and the single-scene structure works well for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Elias plants a seed and imagines future escape rooms, but no actual change crystallizes—just plans and projections. The ending states "The storm-born silence had birthed not a flower, but a revolution" without showing this revolution's cost or concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "tentative smiles, laughter's restoration a haunting gift from the unspoken depths," showing clear before/after with emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the tunnel-as-crucible metaphor, building pressure through maceration imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elowen accepts uncertainty as ally, with visible cost in her transformation. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward this acceptance. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph 3. Deducted for the pendant's convenient appearance and some causality softness in the cultist backstory timing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change when Elias successfully vivifies the crozier and "his stifling destiny fractured," with visible cost in the destruction of his grandfather's relic. The accumulative lens holds as successive approximations build toward transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (alchemist, ember nexus, twilight). The "penny drops" realization moment feels slightly rushed, and the final transformation could use one more beat of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery of the "shard of hush" that reveals renewal patterns in the ruins, with cost implied through the city's abandonment and her "years of loss." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic elements build toward the final vision. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from clock malfunction through grotto transport to radio solution, with the hourglass amplifying signals to merge timelines creating a decisive change. The cost (permanent scar of worlds entwined) is stated but not fully dramatized - we don't see how this changes Elias or the world beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias discovers connection through violent eruption rather than gentle touch, with visible cost in "mirrors cracked in spiderweb fissures" and irrevocable memory alteration. The accumulative structure coheres around the weaving pattern that builds to emotional eruption. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening, though the precise nature of memory alteration remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building around the chain link's geometry, but closure lacks a decisive on-page cost—Elara simply continues teaching with renewed purpose. The orientation is clear (benthic city, post-alien contact), yet the piece reads more as extended exposition about a discovery than a story with meaningful tightening. No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the ending states "this was only the beginning" without crystallizing what has changed.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's intervention preserves the atrium, with visible cost in the urgency of stopping demolition. The accumulative build from discovery to protection works well, though the transition to finding Mira feels slightly convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands with the codex dissolving and scientists' essences returning through the cables, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the codex is destroyed). Orientation anchors clearly (underwater facility, Elias as spelunker). However, the phase transition mechanism feels convenient rather than earned, and the cost remains mostly conceptual without visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's defragmentation parallels Elara's psychological restoration, with visible cost in the blood/porcelain injury. The accumulative lens holds as patterns in ink mirror corrupted data structures. However, the causal mechanism linking ink patterns to digital defragmentation strains credibility without established world rules, and the resolution's completeness ("glitches smoothed into clarity") undermines the promised cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the tunnel becomes "a living archive where textures sang forever," achieving Elar's goal with the language's death transmuted into eternal resonance. The accumulative structure builds through texture descriptions, bird patterns, and acoustic layering. Cost appears conceptually (the language dies, the last elder falls silent) but Elar himself pays minimal visible price, weakening the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain from undercover investigation through discovery to transformation constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (losing human form). The orientation anchors (underground garden, Elara as researcher, post-disappearances timeframe) establish by ~100 words. The closure lands with Elara's metamorphosis and acceptance, though the transformation's mechanics could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the orchard's transformation from mechanical to organic, showing clear before/after with visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as musical resonance builds density through the piece, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with statues crumbling "one by one" without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the arcade scene toward the drone launch, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "broken promises healed not in grand gestures, but in the fostered links of absence." Orientation anchors effectively (mailman in disputed territory, cobalt arcade, twilight), and the closure lands with visible cost in the risk taken and the community's held breath, though the final "ready for tomorrow's lone drop" feels slightly pat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the "misting hush" and "whispering gleam" building toward Elias's song as a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms both him and the space. The closure lands with visible cost (breaking decades of silence) and the halo fragment's embedding promises renewal. Minor causality wobble: the halo's sudden warming and compulsion to sing feels slightly unmotivated beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through hyperbolic geometry ritual to the vision sequence. Resonant Reconfiguration lands via Charged Poise—Elara glimpses the "eternal archive" with felt cost in her "profound, observed solitude." Orientation anchors (library, midnight, Elara) establish early, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding shifts from capture to release, with felt emotional cost ("tears blurred"). The accumulative build through dawn ritual to revelation works, though the cipher decoding moment ("the longing wasn't for recapture, but for release") could use more embodied weight rather than direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's shift from paralyzed longing to "quiet resolve" with her "heart unlocked." However, the cost remains abstract ("enveloped secrets as a beacon") without concrete price. The locksmith's appearance and the star's guidance feel coincidental rather than causally earned, weakening the closure's foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the memory recovery. Closure occurs through Resonant Reconfiguration when memories flood back, though the cost feels abstract ("decades' worth of loss") rather than embodied. The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains causality, but the transformation happens too easily—touching the mushroom immediately triggers complete memory recovery without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from backwards steps to "turning forward for the first time in years," with visible cost in her confrontation of past exile trauma. Causality flows cleanly from Elara's recognition of shared exile through tea-reading ritual to Lir's shadow loosening, though the mechanics of reversible exile could be more concrete. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early with the shard-mirrors and maintains coherent accumulative pressure toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building toward the seed's planting and transformation. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the magical tree bridges worlds and restores wonder to villagers, with visible cost in "eyes dulled by endless toil" being transformed. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, though the fantastical elements strain causal linkage slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's ritual completion, with visible cost in her shared secret and the spirits' grounding. The accumulative structure builds through each unraveled knot releasing silence and masks, culminating in peace "as lucid as the starlit prisms above." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias crossing the "divide" between known/unknown, completing his father's quest. Causality flows logically from map discovery through footage comparison to chapel opening. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we don't see what Elias sacrifices or how the discovery changes him beyond symbolic completion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear orientation and closure that lands with conceptual repricing about letting go. However, the causality linking the radio discovery to the final epiphany feels convenient rather than inevitable - the connection between untangling literal threads and understanding emotional release lacks strong causal grounding. The accumulative structure works but some key turns feel arranged.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elowen's liberation of the ghost and her own voice being "finally heard by the winds." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the ghost's release. Cost is legible through the "articulated needs" of lost creators and Elowen's evolution from isolation to connection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes clear anchors (elevator, spire, ascending servant) and follows a coherent accumulative structure through the diary discoveries. However, closure feels incomplete—Elara steps out "ready to serve" but this Charged Poise lacks the required visible or felt cost. The diary's revelation about the spire as a "beacon" reweights the setting conceptually, but Elara's actual change or choice remains abstract without on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds pressure through the ascending gondola and thinning air. The tether breaking creates clear inciting incident. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the realization that "voids weren't empty; they were archives" reweights the premise with felt emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds consistently through to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure builds from stillness through discovery to creation, with the book safe revelation providing meaningful deepening. However, the closure's cost remains more conceptual than felt - "the oak's quiet gratitude" and "fractally precise in memory" lack the visible price needed for higher bands. The orientation anchors (dawn, elder oak library, demolition pending) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with discovery leading to revelation, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara finds the luminance map without sacrifice or trade-off. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains single-scene unity, yet the ending projects future action rather than landing a decisive change on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara becomes "guardian of rhythms," with visible cost in her transformation from specialized locksmith to universal mender. The accumulative structure builds through prophecy fragments, mirror alignment, and gear assembly to earn this shift. Minor orientation delay (library location/time unclear initially) and some causality softness in how prophecies guide her path prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands with the orchards' renewal through collective action, satisfying an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the cost remains abstract—we see renewal but not what was sacrificed or risked. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with planet, arches, and situation established.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's role transforms from clock adjuster to lullaby-giver, with emotional cost visible in her tears. However, the piece lacks concrete anchoring of when/where beyond "dusk" and relies heavily on abstract conceptual movement rather than dramatized events. The orientation never fully crystallizes in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara accepts her role with the curse loosening, showing clear before/after with felt cost. The causal chain from discovering the nut to recalibrating the birds holds, though the blueprint's sudden complete revelation strains credibility. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with nature imagery building toward insight, but the closure lacks visible cost—the phone call succeeds too easily without dramatized friction. The chrysalis-to-connection leap relies on assertion rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara discovers that stories begin in "shimmering emptiness, quantified and ready for parole" - a conceptual repricing of narrative origins. The accumulative structure builds through three incisions that reveal the hidden alcove. Cost is visible (moonlight depleted) and felt (fragmentation cohering). Minor orientation delay (vendor role unclear initially) costs -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from brittle to sturdy through absorbing remorse, with cost shown in "chill seeping into her bones." The causal chain from rain → pools → hidden pavilion → transformation follows logic but relies on convenient discovery. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "desert fortress of Kharidun."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal structure: Elara's decision to fix the clock leads directly to approaching Klaus, which cascades into the gathering. The closure (silos becoming symphonies) lands with visible cost—years of isolation overcome. The orientation is immediate and the Accumulative lens holds throughout, though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias becomes "guardian of what was forsaken," with visible cost in the pain of neural rewiring and the weight of cataloging others' lost dreams. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from canyon arrival through mirror discovery to synaptic modification. Minor deduction for slight orientation drift in the middle third where the neural implant backstory momentarily obscures present action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from manuscript discovery through grotto exploration to seed retrieval, with gravity inversion as the enabling constraint. Closure lands as Decisive Change (Elara obtains seeds and visions of their purpose) with visible cost in the risk undertaken. The visions sequence feels convenient but doesn't break causality; orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from silence to resonant sound, with the hedgehog's uncurling marking temporal progression and the final communion serving as effective Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is felt through the "weight of silence" and years of dedication, though could be more sharply defined at the precise closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered silences and correlations to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias realigns the covenant and transforms exile into "a board reset for deeper play." Cost is visible in the years of exile and the dent's "badge of endurance." Orientation anchors solidly (Elias, magnetic nexus, twilight), and the covenant's eclipse provides clear stakes that pay off when "no longer fully eclipsed."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias's understanding deepens through the diary's "varieties of silence," with felt emotional cost in his tears. The accumulative structure coheres around silence/empathy themes. However, the cost could be more concrete - what does this new knowledge demand of him beyond feeling?

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the corpse flower's bloom as the "turning of the tide's thought." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms the flower's assault into wisdom about "serenity in motion," though the cost—while conceptually stated—lacks sufficient embodied weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with discovery as the decisive change, and the arrow tip revelation provides legitimate closure with implied cost (responsibility to safeguard). However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we don't see Elara grapple with the weight of her discovery or what safeguarding means for her specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong causal chain: crash investigation → wind pattern discovery → understanding of convergence factors → preventive recommendations. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias walking out with "foresight taking root," though the cost is primarily retrospective (the crash itself) rather than a present sacrifice. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the statue emerges and wonder is certified as essential, with clear before/after transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory layers build toward the climactic revelation. However, the cost remains abstract—we see the statue freed but no concrete price Elara pays, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformed understanding, with visible cost in her confrontation with past failure. The causal chain from failure to return to vision to insight holds clearly. The orientation anchors (Thunder-echo Range, six moons ago) establish context early. Closure lands with "second chances" and "melody yet to come" but the conceptual shift from control to yielding could use more concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding shifts from seeking mathematical emotion to accepting "turbulent flow of shared feeling." The closure lands with conceptual cost as she smiles "through her borrowed tears," though the transformation from seeking control to accepting chaos could sharpen. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through the pendant's transfer creating resonant transformation. The gift-giving crystallizes Thorne's legacy with visible cost (giving away the precious pendant). Orientation anchored early and causality holds throughout, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Solid accumulative structure building to a resonant reconfiguration. The sequence from doubt through method to revelation follows logically under the textural lens. Closure lands with visible cost as she confronts buried grief about her sister. The "shifted hush" moment effectively reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a valid Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's sacrifice of her tapestry to send the message, with visible cost in the unraveling of decades of work. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the final sacrificial moment, though the magical mechanics of the amber bead's journey feel slightly convenient despite being prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where the magician's silk awakens resilience from rubble. The cost appears in "frayed but triumphant" silk and the planet's stabilization, though the transformation feels too smooth—the confusion/understanding tension resolves without genuine friction or meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal linkage throughout with clear closure - Elara discovers the withheld truth and accepts its weight, choosing to "map responsibly." The Decisive Change lands with visible cost as she understands her mentor's sacrifice. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs, and the drive lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery driving the narrative—stone stacks, letter chain, sea glass—building to Elias's decision to preserve the tradition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he relights the lamp while carrying forward the "bottled essence of safety," with felt cost in his acceptance of the lonely burden. The single-scene structure maintains coherent causality from arrival through discovery to commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the Herald's routine building toward a Conceptual Repricing where his obsolescence becomes the cost of renewal. However, the closure's cost ("his own form fading") appears only in vision rather than dramatized action, and the piece lacks clear orientation anchors for who/what the Herald actually is until too late.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara stepping "toward the edge, the mist parting like a story yielding to its teller" with clear cost (abandoning protective caution). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward the final transformation. The orientation anchors (valley, tea house, dye master) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "magnetizing stories" which could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's "deconstruction had unlocked the trees' silent testimony." The sextant's healing under moonlight creates a clear before/after with felt cost ("sorrows blooming into constellations of resilience"). Minor orientation delays (tower's exact nature unclear early) don't compromise the strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure with the realm's renewal, but the cost remains abstract ("harmonious renewal") rather than visceral. The accumulative lens holds but lacks the decisive tightening that would make the transformation feel earned. The bracketed meta-commentary at the end severely undermines closure integrity, breaking the fictional dream.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's paradoxical resolution—"staying above in body as janitor's duties called him back soon, but leaving in spirit." The causal chain from finding invitation to entering the hidden library is clear, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly within the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an Accumulative lens, the piece builds through layered acts toward Earned Stasis—Elara finding peace while accepting guilt's weight. The closure lands with subtle cost, though it could be more visceral at "she had found her peace."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the stabilization of the vows, qualifying as Earned Stasis. However, the cost remains abstract ("oblivion's edge") rather than felt—Elara pays no visible price for her success, and the resolution arrives through technical adjustment rather than meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows a causal lens with three attempted thwarts building to a partial success. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the second paragraph. However, closure lacks decisive change - Elara "slips away" with vague resolution about clearing her father's path, and the cost remains abstract ("comforting unease fading") rather than visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract - "forever changed" without showing what Elara sacrifices or loses. The meta-commentary disruption at the end ("But wait, that's over—recalibrate") breaks the closure unit entirely, undermining any accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure as Elias transforms from artistic exile to "triumphant surrender," with visible cost in "auroral sorrow across its pages—luminous grief for lost years." The safe-opening sequence provides clear because/therefore linkage, and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to Vault with clear closure as Elara emerges transformed, ready to inscribe recovered truths. The map discovery drives investigation, Kael's lie propels her forward, and the Vault delivers on its promise. Cost is visible in her emergence "transformed" with renewed purpose against the city's dishonesty.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sculpture's activation transforms both listeners and validates Elias's mission, with visible cost in tears and dissolved cynicism. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the closure relies on witnessed transformation rather than Elias facing a final choice that would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Elias transforms chaos into "guardian of balance," finding rhythm with the roses. The controlled burn protocol creates meaningful escalation through miniaturization and containment, with visible cost in his blistering synthetic skin and the unburned shard he embraces as "fuel for tomorrow's tending."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible community healing when letters spill forth. The accumulative structure works through gathered stories, though the resolution feels slightly mechanical - the hidden key solving everything without genuine cost to Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Liora's liberation (Decisive Change) with visible cost in the dangerous underwater setting and personal risk. The causal chain from dice rolls to cipher creation to system breach is traceable. However, the resolution arrives too smoothly—Silas's capitulation and the sister's instant restoration lack sufficient resistance or complication, and the "mysterious familiarity" between Elara and the AI needed more concrete grounding earlier to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's beaching triggering memory loss, leading to Elias's descent into the salt chamber where he recovers his wife's pressed flowers. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when finding the flowers restores his memories and reweights the whale's death as purposeful rather than random. Some causality strains appear (why would whale songs dislodge memories stored in salt crystals), but the emotional cost of grief recovered is palpable in "his lost pieces reclaimed from the earth's quiet hoard."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elar successfully binds the prophecy, foreclosing the path of doom with visible cost. The causal chain from prophecy-vision to ritual-location to mapping-silence holds coherently. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("unravel the world's fragile balance") without concrete immediacy, and the final meta-commentary disrupts closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as weekly tea sessions deepen understanding until the rooftop crystallizes into confession and seal-passing. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara hears the building's voice as "familiar lullaby" rather than "eerie whispers," with the seal as talisman marking her acceptance of this burden. Cost is primarily conceptual—accepting responsibility for hidden knowledge—though more embodied consequence would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from "charmed skeptic" to "quiet certainty," with the cost being her acceptance of solitude. However, the "resonance structures" mechanism feels underexplained—the actual process of archiving memories through "vibrational alignments" lacks concrete grounding. The closure lands but with conceptual fuzziness that weakens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's ritual of unlinking, with visible cost (blood, surrendered thorn). The accumulative structure builds through repeated imagery (dripping stalactites, aurora, pearl twilight) toward emotional release, though the transformation feels slightly too neat without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's sacrifice that frees the echoes, representing a Decisive Change with visible cost ("her voice now carried a softer, sadder tone"). However, the causality relies heavily on exposition through the seashell's revelations rather than dramatized discovery, and the Echo Weavers remain abstract antagonists without concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as ghosts are freed through Elara's exposure of hidden truths, with the melted snow globe reforming as tangible proof of reclaimed purity. Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered ghost appearances culminating in the revelation about suppressed affections. Orientation anchors clearly (Elara, glacier shrine, wreck-diving role) and causality traces from diving experience through windows method to final release, though the mechanics of how exposure frees ghosts could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure ("in following moon paths, one mends not just nets, but the soul"). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening. The closure lands as philosophical crystallization but lacks visible cost—Hiroshi's revelation involves no sacrifice, loss, or foreclosed path, only affirming satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal structure is solid—investigation leads to discovery leads to knowledge that changes her path forward. Closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (truth that will "shatter lies"). However, the ending is severely damaged by drafting artifacts ("But wait, that's over—adjusting," word count commentary) that muddle what should be a clean revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from isolated visionary to prophet whose words reshape society below. However, causality weakens in the middle third with vague "storm after storm" progression, and the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The line "His prophecies, once lyrical whispers, now roared across the peaks" summarizes rather than dramatizes the crucial transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure works well - each jar of sound builds toward the music box's revival as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost appears in Elias's tears and the weight of his vagrant life "alchemized into purpose." The pattern of capturing/releasing sounds teaches itself early and pays off at closure, though the metaphorical language occasionally obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a situational lens with Elias responding to the ice threat, but closure lacks a decisive change with visible cost—the ice simply stops advancing and everything returns to status quo. The orientation is clear (lighthouse marina, Elias as engineer, artifact threat) but the resolution through "sonic absolution" feels like convenient problem-solving without meaningful sacrifice or transformation. No path is genuinely foreclosed; the artifact remains safe without Elias paying any price beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the viaduct crossing that "unyokes" mental chains, with the frozen lake's crack heralding change. Causal lens holds: Elara's moon-mapping method transforms impatient rebels into patient revolutionaries who then cross the magnetic threshold. Cost is visible in Thorne's struggle and the "slow grind of time and will" required for this patient revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lantern discovery triggering memory-entanglement that reweights Hale's death from accident to murder. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias breaks free from bureau control, with the glass shard symbolizing his commitment and Clara's escape fortifying his resolve. The cost is legible in his decision to document "unredacted" evidence, risking his position.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elias transforms guilt into action through the repaired music box, with visible cost in Harlan's death and missed chance. The causal lens holds cleanly—Thorne's repair expertise enables Elias's shift from passive regret to active redemption, though the final beat could sharpen the exact cost more precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward the kaleidoscope transliteration climax. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the bell rings "unheard by distant flotillas yet destined to echo," though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains causal coherence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis—Elara becomes "secret guardian" with clear foreclosed path (exposure). The causal chain from anomaly discovery through coordinates to cover-up revelation holds cleanly. However, cost remains somewhat abstract ("not yet" suggests deferred consequence rather than present price), and the orientation wobbles with dense worldbuilding that delays grounding until ~200 words.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure attempts a Decisive Change (conflict resolution through empathy) but the cost remains abstract - we see the resolution but not what Elara sacrifices or risks. The causal chain works (fragment → visions → understanding → resolution) but the transformation happens too easily. The bracketed word count confusion and meta-commentary about story length severely disrupts the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara shifts from "spectator to endings" to active participant, hearing the sound "not as terror, but as a gentle unfurling." The cost is legible—she risks herself in the storm to guide others. However, the "procedure that promised clarity" remains vague, and the causality between her tourism and volunteering could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory detail and parallel stories to a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters reframe their losses. The closure lands with Elena watching Liam depart, "her heart lighter with the understanding they'd nurtured," showing earned change with emotional cost. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (Elena alone at the station, autumn evening).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis - Elar successfully consecrates the echo, preserving it "eternally" through his ritual. The situational pressure (the echo threatening to dissolve) forces his action, and there's a felt cost in his "fear that the echo might slip away forever." However, the stakes feel somewhat abstract - we don't see what losing this wisdom would mean concretely or why this particular prophet's words matter.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara arranging photos to create a healing archive, but no decisive change occurs on the page—she simply gathers the photos back into her case with renewed purpose. The orientation anchors (lavender field, factory ruins, Elara as archivist) arrive clearly by ~50 words. The closure moment ("Elara's masterpiece took root") remains abstract without showing how the archive actually transforms pain or demonstrating visible cost beyond metaphorical "heavier with purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. Elias discovers the crystal's properties and testifies to language's evolution, but no path is foreclosed and no price is paid. The orientation is clear but the "fractured sequences" structure promised in the text never materializes into meaningful non-linearity. Heavy reliance on reflection (~40%) without concrete anchoring to present choices violates BRR policy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Elias's repeated attempts to mark paths and capture sound build density toward the final successful recording—a Resonant Reconfiguration where he holds "if only for a moment" what was fleeting. Cost is felt in the trembling hands and desperate clinging, though the final prophecy of future solace softens the immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands with the probe launch achieving escape velocity, a Decisive Change with visible cost (the risk of failure, the years of preparation). The causal chain from earthquake to clock malfunction to leaf-inspired solution holds. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—we see achievement but not what was sacrificed or risked beyond general failure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through hymning, scent imagery, and the mother-daughter reunion creating a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Cost is visible in Elena's tears, her whispered confession of pushing family away, and the final letting go. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (hospice, Elara as therapist, guitar).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery of the Null Vault and her new role as "bearer of awakenings' subtle key," with conceptual cost in understanding the shadows' vital sanctuary function. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as runes accumulate meaning and the orrery's activation deepens understanding. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—Elara gains knowledge without paying a visible price or facing a true foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts loss and transforms grief into "innovative hope." The closure lands with emotional cost ("years lost to illusion"), though the magical resolution feels somewhat convenient. Causality weakens when the tooth dissolves into light without clear mechanics, and the ending's abstract language ("nostalgic innovation her enduring light") dilutes the cost's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and sensory details build toward Elara's transformation from isolation to connection. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she shares the sea glass with villagers, creating community through reflected light. Cost is visible in her emergence from protective isolation. Some causality wobbles in the middle third with excessive reflection, but the ending reweights her earthbound watching as a bridge for others.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the pendant's repricing from "chain to pain" to "beacon of grafted hope," with clear emotional cost paid through vulnerability. The accumulative structure coheres around the moss garden's reclamation metaphor, though the viral confession backstory feels slightly disconnected from the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias gathering "shapes of hopes" through visions, but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost. The completion of the manuscript reads as predetermined rather than earned through pressure. While the spiral motif and collected hopes create texture, the ending states completion without showing what Elias sacrifices or how his stance fundamentally shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through ritual restoration, with the village transforming from "crops withered and spirits dim" to renewed sacred practices. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the cost remains more collective than personal to Elowen, weakening the closure's individual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the plate transforms into pulsating maps of grief. Cost is visible in Elara's physical suffering and the emotional price of confronting loss, though the transformation's mechanics remain somewhat opaque, preventing full causality clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's methodical reverse-engineering building toward the breakthrough moment when "the timer whirred faintly." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as he realizes "the harvest was his own reflection, echoed back" with the cost of his family's loss made explicit. Orientation anchors (locksmith, cavern, post-war refuge) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara glimpses potential release while remaining trapped, with the cost of eternal vigil made legible. The accumulative lens holds as she methodically transforms burdens, building density toward the crystallized ending. However, the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt rather than intellectually stated ("perhaps the sum of all burdens would counter").

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time fragments building toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from passive grief to active creation through harvested memories. The kettle's boiling provides temporal constraint while memory crystals accumulate meaning, culminating in her beginning to carve. Cost is visible in the "fractured" memories and Marcus's death, though the final carving action could show more immediate price. Who/where/when anchored early; single-scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's negotiation with her ghost transforms regret into "a new, still narrative" with clear cost (accepting the erosion of ambitions). The accumulative lens holds as fragments build toward this reconfiguration. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of the ghost negotiation prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the terminal transforms from "graveyard of dreams" to "whispered of voyages yet to come" with visible cost (her solitary effort). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through technical details and the sextant's reweighting, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands with Elias accepting his abandoned dream, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres but the final "peace made" assertion replaces dramatized resolution, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias recognizes the architecture of lies includes his own self-deceptions. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we're told about "serene upheaval settling into quiet resolve" but don't see what specific path is foreclosed or what price he pays. The causal chain from diving to finding the chest to revelation works but feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias receives the weavers' gift and preserves it in fulgurite glass, with emotional cost visible in his tears. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers and philosophical density toward this crystallized moment. However, the cost could be more visceral—we see tears but don't feel what Elias sacrifices or risks in this vigil beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering the thread and weaving it into his written obituary for Liora, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration through metaphorical connection. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"quiet resolve" and choosing solitude—without visible sacrifice or transformation. The orientation anchors (Elias in the garden after missing the ship) arrive clearly, but the closure lacks the felt weight needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the egg's discovery transforms Elarion's hypotheses into concrete possibility, with cost implied through the "bittersweet" fragility that "mocked the mechanical world's indomitable grind." The accumulative structure builds through collecting fragments toward this crystallizing moment. Orientation anchors adequately by line 3, though the abstract opening delays grounding slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the grafting act and the wanderer's acceptance, with visible cost in both characters' scars. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of shared healing. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure lands with "the song had begun," though the wanderer's arc could use stronger causal linkage to Elara's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when memories flood out and revive the fountains, with clear emotional cost tied to Elara's mother. The accumulative lens holds as imagery (geese, fountains, glass shards) builds density toward release. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism where patience alone unsticks centuries of curse.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through generational echoes and petal imagery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) as Elowen accepts the infinite cycle while offering "light without fire." The cost—perpetuating the very patterns she sought to break—is conceptually present but not viscerally felt in the final beats, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterfly imagery, ribbon patterns, and family grief layering toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where collective grief transforms from "void" to "resilient braid." Cost is legible in the completed gravestone monument and Liora's departure. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptualization of grief's "shape" rather than more embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the pendulum's pause triggering visions that build toward confession. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias emerges with the rake handle to share the inscriptions, with thirty years of guilt as visible cost. The mystical element (ghost, preserved rake) strains credibility slightly but serves the emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear discovery beats: finding the case → examining tapestry → decoding threads → understanding the past duel. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elias realizes "the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid," though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The meta-commentary about word count and the orientation delay (cemetery context emerges gradually) weaken structural clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story reaches Charged Poise with Elara's blueprint complete and quill poised, but the cost remains abstract ("the future unwritten but vividly mapped"). The accumulative structure builds texture effectively, yet the ending lacks a concrete, felt price—we see preparation but no sacrifice or foreclosed path that would make the transformation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "guardian of the reborn stories," with clear cost in his clandestine risk-taking. The accumulative structure builds through discovery-application-dissemination, though the orientation arrives slightly late (protagonist named only in line 1, world-building context emerges gradually through first third).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the mask on the chair crystallizing the mirage of safety with felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern early through the ash-scattering ritual and builds density toward the final image. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some opacity around the gallery's actual function beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis - Elias resolves to keep the cog buried "with me, a secret narrative to outlast their clamor," foreclosing the path of sharing with visible cost. The accumulative structure builds through sedimentary layers toward this crystallization. Orientation anchors clearly (Elysium Spire, post-plague, sewer philosopher) though the piece could tighten its middle excavation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elias remaining in the library "expectantly resigned to the next uncertain chord" after successfully braiding voices into harmony. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the weeks of teaching, with clear cost visible in the students' gradual unlearning. Orientation is cleanly established early, and the multi-paragraph backstory (wandering through Europe) is anchored to present teaching and changes his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the greenhouse's transformation from ruin to "haven of blooming defiance," with the seed's growth marking change. However, cost remains largely conceptual—while the "prunings forming a nest of sacrifice" suggests price, no personal stake is risked or lost. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the greenhouse's renewal, though the rapid community-building in the final third strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's understanding transforms despair into curiosity through Elias's riddle-wrapped truth, with the blackout's cause revealed as bio-engineered bee failure. Causality flows cleanly from setup through revelation, though the cost of the system failure could be more viscerally felt beyond the abstract "city dark."

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively—Elias's repositioning of objects transforms the cottage from "hollow shell" to "aglow with inner light," with clear cost in his vigilant labor and the emotional weight of confronting abandonment. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from observation through discovery to active restoration. Orientation anchors (bay, spring, cottage) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's certainty transforms into nuanced understanding, with clear cost (risking dome collapse). The cascading revelations structure works causally, each truth building on the last. Minor orientation delay (underwater city context emerges gradually) but serves the discovery pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias ruptures infinity through mathematical proof, transforming endless ascent into "personal triumph" with the chipped die becoming whole—a clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure builds from physical climbing through mathematical modeling to conceptual breakthrough, though the resolution's mechanics ("differential equation balancing daring ascent") border on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered daydreams building to the Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds rest. The closure lands with felt cost (months of insomnia yielding) and conceptual repricing (art as invocation). Minor deduction for some causality softness in how the brush's magical properties manifest—the glow and hum feel slightly unearned despite the mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: beekeeper's departure → ice melting → tools endangered → Elara's rescue attempt → communal revival. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as "history thawed, but not yet lost" shows both preservation and transformation with visible cost. The opera glass lens accidentally accelerating the melt provides strong irony, though the transition from personal crisis to communal action feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building around reversal and radiance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias breaks fate's threads but remains in a shadowed world. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, island, low tide) establish early. However, the cost at closure—"forever changed in a world still shadowed"—feels more stated than dramatized, lacking the visceral weight needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a clear on-page closure with visible cost—the meta-commentary ending ("Word count error—must fit") breaks the narrative frame entirely, destroying any closure effect. Multiple false endings and self-corrections ("Wait, that's over—recalibrate," "No, trim back") shatter causality in the final third. The piece teaches no pattern for these interruptions, making them artifacts rather than purposeful structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the storm building from coiled clouds to full tempest, each mallet strike layering resonance until the orchard transforms. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as chaos becomes symphony with visible cost (the storm's battering absorbed into bass). Orientation anchors clearly (orchard on driftwood, blue hour, open seas) and the fractal pattern taught early pays off when sketched resonances activate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Story follows Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern language as the accumulating element, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara learns Thorne's fate and must choose between freeing him or protecting the city. Cost is legible in "grief-laced resolve" and the final question about unleashing "ancient wrath." The gate's rust and expedition's loss establish persistent constraints that shape the entire narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal structure with clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens—each discovery (platform→ticket office→letter→truth) builds pressure toward Elias's reconfiguration of historical understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he walks away carrying "recaptured truth," with cost visible in acknowledging "some petals must fall for roots to strengthen." Minor deduction for slight orientation drift in middle section where reflection occasionally obscures present action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered imagery of erosion, abandonment, and preservation, culminating in Elias embedding dream-notes in the foundation—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. Who/where/when anchored early (surveyor, coastal town, after drawbridge rises). The closure transforms him from recorder to active preserver, though the meta-commentary at the end ("Actually, final: Elias returned to shore...") disrupts the otherwise clean landing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens building toward conceptual repricing - Elara reweights Thalassara's fall from disaster to deliberate preservation. Good orientation and single-scene focus. The closure lands with cost (her commitment to surface the truth) and the discovery sequence follows logical causality through her indexing method.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, with density building through layered craft descriptions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms into flight. The shadow's detachment signals early stakes, and the final image of "weaving loss into flight" lands with felt cost, though the closure could be more decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with Elias discovering the energy pools and launching his revenge, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost—he simply "steps into the void with a grin." The perturbation experiment reveals information that changes his understanding, yet the final action (leaving to hunt) doesn't show what he sacrifices or loses, making the before/after change conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's discovery of the frequency transforms her from "adrift in skies of solitude" to bound "to the cosmos in a symphony of belonging," with emotional cost legible in her softening expression. The accumulative structure builds through technological decoding toward spiritual connection, though the pilgrim's backstory arrives late without earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Solid accumulative structure with clear closure in Elias's decision to tell Eliza the truth. Good orientation and the watch hand discovery provides effective escalation. The cost of ending his protective lie is felt, though could be more viscerally present on the page. Causality holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prisoner exchange completes with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the drawer pull transforms from talisman to bridge between brothers, showing cost through "mistakes alchemized into something enduring." Causality holds but the stakes feel abstract—we never learn what information the spy carries or why Tomas was captured. The orientation anchors arrive late (prisoner exchange context not clear until line 13).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias's journey motivated by regret and seeking reconciliation, but the closure fails critical tests. The author's meta-commentary intrusion ("Wait, no—word count check") catastrophically breaks immersion at the climactic moment. Lena's appearance lacks causal setup, reading as coincidence-driven resolution rather than earned change, and the bracketed technical notes destroy any narrative coherence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from procedure to newspaper discovery to underground journey, with the baseball serving as a tangible key to transformation. The closure lands with Elias emerging changed, but the final paragraph's self-conscious rewrites ("But wait, that's over—recalibrate... No, trim to essence") severely undermines the closure's authority and introduces unnecessary ambiguity about what actually happened.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with fortune cookie → spice ritual → transformation → reunion, but the closure lacks visible cost beyond the stated metamorphosis. The transformation succeeds too smoothly without meaningful complication or price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish adequately by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's ritual that "mends not in form but in essence," with visible cost in her tears and the weight of lost time. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery and the tablecloth ritual. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the daughter's birth context emerges in paragraph 3) and some causality softness in how the ritual actually reclaims time.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with shadow work ritual building through photographs→tapestry→tear→dimension opening, creating Resonant Reconfiguration where "ghosts of the past found their way home." Cost is conceptual but legible through "shadows lingered—unresolved fragments" requiring confrontation. Minor deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the post-human timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's understanding crystallizes through the release of fireflies. The prophecy fulfillment provides causal linkage, though some connective tissue between detour and prophecy feels convenient rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from blackout opportunity through sundial decoding to accessing the cradle of sparks, with Elara's knowledge and the quill holder's properties driving each turn. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the group's collective "wink" and shared vision crystallize their revolutionary commitment, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from elusive herder to active seeker, with the mandala ritual crystallizing her path to reunion. The accumulative build through symbol-painting and eel-herding pays off, though the mentor revelation arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through storm imagery building to decisive action. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid when Elias descends with the envelope, crystallizing his choice to "redraw the maps" with visible risk. Who/where/when anchored early (observatory, storm night). Deduction for somewhat abstract cost—the danger of courier delivery is stated but not fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure—Elias extends the needle card proposing alliance rather than violence, crystallizing new options with visible stakes. The causal chain from finding the card through decoding to reframing confrontation holds. Cost appears in the risk of this diplomatic gambit, though it could be more viscerally felt. Some mechanical connectors ("Suddenly, the action seized him") and late exposition about the overture's meaning slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the library transforms from "skeletal sanctuary" to "blooming resistance," with the coffee tin's smuggling function providing causal linkage mid-story. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "poetry and friendship could hammer chaos into something eternal," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise, with Elias's performance crystallizing his stance toward fate, though the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the film discovery and projection sequence, but the closure's "launchpad for whatever melody awaited" lacks the specificity needed for full cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ritual awakening reconfigures the island's relationship to memory, with the seed sprouting into a protective tree. The accumulative lens holds as memories layer through dream sequences into collective ritual. Cost is visible in Elara's persistent doubt about permanence against the monsoon. Minor orientation delay (fantasy reality checker role takes time to parse) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through discovery of compass, reading lace instructions, and ritual with salt water, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias voices his apology and finds "quiet strength to prune the future's twisted limbs." Cost is legible in the "cerulean, deep and mournful" color matching where Mira vanished. Orientation anchors effectively (islet, post-storm, Elias as bonsai tutor), and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

The meta edits (“[wait, recalibrating…]”) briefly disrupt cadence but do not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp early: who she is, where, and the golden-hour clock. The structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens with causal turns (flower code → easel → jar → reinterpretation). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with her role reweighted, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. No teleports or broken rules; the jar’s late arrival is motivated and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/when all legible), and the accumulative lens holds. Closure lands as a decisive change: he abandons the outpost, taking the orbs and bookmark. Cost is present conceptually (leaving the “cradle of creation,” forfeiting the site’s history) though not harrowingly felt. The because/therefore chain (melting→instability→leave) reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal drive is clean: betrayal revelation → library search → cipher decoding → confrontation → public exposure → binding/sirens. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (Marcus trapped, authorities incoming) and a reconfigured self-image. Some convenience edges (the seashell speaker’s perfect utility, swift decryption) slightly soften cost. Orientation is firm from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterning of silences intensifies toward the star’s extinction and the mental map’s inception. Orientation is clean early, and the piece builds a coherent cadence shift as the storm pauses and the last star dies. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis—map begun; paper refused—with conceptual cost (true night; loss of physical inscription). The pressure is subtle but legible; a slightly sharper tightening might have lifted it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the discovery of the violin catalyzes loops that deepen meaning, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pattern of loops is taught and carried through. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she continues sweeping with reweighted understanding. Cost is present but modest, residing in the acceptance of ongoing duty over transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres; orientation is early and clean. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias crosses from observer to participant at visible personal cost. Causal flow is soft but logical within the story’s rules (lens → clarity → approach → shared doodle). A shade of mystic convenience around the lens keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern of daily ritual accrues until the Luckometer spike and the found marble catalyze a Conceptual Repricing of luck vs care. Orientation is crisp, and the closure image (garden returning his token) is on-page. However, the key turn leans on coincidence (spike/discovery) rather than a pressure-fed choice, and cost remains gentle. Still, the before/after in belief is legible and earned by the motif groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene causal throughline is clean: prepare, sync, pull lever, observe proof. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing when the holograms render sideways time undeniable, though the cost is faint. Orientation is strong from the outset; pattern holds under an accumulative/textural lens. Risks are flagged (destabilization) but never cash out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens coherently from discovery to decoding to disruption. The closure lands on-page: the veil opens, Isabella is glimpsed, and the program’s destruction exacts cost. Because/therefore linkages read clean (find program → decode → play → rupture and loss). Orientation is crisp early; the chosen lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a single-scene, accumulative lens toward a closure that lands as a quiet decision/charged poise. “Smudging” functions as the actionable hinge that reweights Elara’s options and culminates in choosing to descend. Orientation is clean, and the before/after is legible with cost implied (leaving the haven). Meta intrusions in brackets nick momentum but don’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV accumulative structure builds through radio calls → valve activation → apparition → parallel confession, closing on a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Orientation is clear early; the drive lens holds. The closure lands on-page as a charged poise/CR: he is “forever altered,” with the talisman burning in-pocket. Slight causality softness around the ghost’s sudden appearance prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: swan → tunnels → refuge → ritualized witnessing, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset, and cause-effect is legible. The closure lands via a reweighted final image rather than a decisive turn; cost is present (abandonment, exertion) but soft. One tightening beat suffices, though a sharper on-page price would raise it.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the eclipse clock, harmonica lesson, and talisman transfer build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on-page with cost—she gives Theo the keepsake curl—marking a before/after in their bond. Orientation is clear early; cause-feel linkages are steady. The turn is quiet but decisive within the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens and lands a conceptual repricing: Elowen reframes the quest from repair to a new dreaming. Anchors (who/where/when) are early and stable, and the diaries/tapestry are clean causal links within the lyric mode. The cost is mostly conceptual (acceptance of irreparable displacement), which reads but doesn’t bite deeply. Still, the ending image (tucking the fragment; the library’s sigh) closes the loop with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous arc with clean anchors (pub → lighthouse → encounter with Maris) and a coherent throughline. Closure lands as a charged poise: the island’s before/after is legible as visitors will be summoned and secrecy reweighted. Causality holds; coincidence (Maris’s dream) complicates rather than resolves. Cost at closure is conceptual more than dramatized, keeping it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: chant → recoil → surge → intensification → falter. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration: “unraveled stillness” redefined, anchor steadied, loops released into true quiet. The live clock and tool choices keep causality legible under a textural lens. Cost is present but light, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern builds from shell-mapping, frozen mirror, and dawn pressure to a charged poise at the end. Orientation is clean early (Elias, glass spire, frozen lake, pre-dawn). Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration—the dawn-ignited readiness to conduct—under a live clock. The cost is mostly stamina/time-squeeze rather than a decisive trade-off, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure holds under an accumulative/textural lens with clear escalation: call → threshold → retracing → confrontation → integration. Closure lands on-page with the decisive change (timelines fuse; she emerges whole). Causality is mostly intact, though the resolution leaps from realization (“self-imposed cage”) to victory with minimal resistance, softening cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the discovery → repair → reverse-playback cadence tightens cleanly to an emotional break. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration, with visible cost in grief surfacing. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when). Minor reliance on lyric repetition doesn’t disturb causality or the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean single-scene arc: followed → pigeon/message → inference → decision to counter via birds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he commits to lateral resistance with a felt risk from watchers. Causality holds under a hybrid situational/accumulative lens. The on-page cost is soft, more conceptual than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative design tightens around the timed transformation and the UV reveal; cause/effect is coherent (uncorking → resonance → vision → reconfiguration). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The holographic memory mechanism is lightly convenient but doesn’t break the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: uncovering layers → beings’ projection/offer → revelation of their desperation → charged poise at the end. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he lets the rope fall, foreclosing decisive rescue and reweighting his desire. Costs are legible (sacrifice past/freedom vs. saving stars), though they remain conceptual rather than enacted. Meta intrusions about word count slightly blur the cadence but don’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly: music → bowl → communal stories → softened hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the hush returns but reweighted by pebbled memory and communal voice. Cost is conceptual/emotional (living with incompletion) and the scene keeps anchors and causality tidy. Quiet but coherent cadence shift at the end earns its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural pressure holds: the blotter application and rising static tighten toward a decisive inner transformation. Orientation is clean and the closure lands on-page with a before/after. The cost is conceptual (vulnerability, altered practice) rather than dramatized through loss, keeping the turn a shade soft. Still, the final image reweights prior material coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean single-scene causal chain: mistaken envelope → approach → locket reveal → shared lineage → partnership. Closure lands via a Decisive Change (new partnership) but the cost is soft and reliant on coincidence. Orientation is strong early; the drive lens holds. The resolution feels coherent though low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: meet → propose search → partial find → risked descent → discovery → dedication/acceptance. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (belonging gained) and a modest cost (risk, lingering ache). Scope fits a single through-line without teleports or resets. The turns are soft but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Coherent causal chain: sensing the interrupted cadence → borrowing time with the pendant → uncaging the gate → entering the echo chamber → paying a time-debt cost. Orientation is strong (who/where/when) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (“the borrowed time demanded return”). Escalation is clean but light; major obstacles are internalized rather than contested. The drive lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance at the end and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: ritual intensifies from placement to visible threads to repricing of loss. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (acceptance without recovery of the lover). The drive lens stays textural; density and pattern reweight the stake at the end. Minor softness: stakes never face a concrete external test, relying wholly on the ritual’s interior cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the outage, pipe-chase uncovering, and memory density build to the on-page reconfiguration where he steps into view. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/when). Closure lands with cost in the final tableau—he risks exposure and forecloses pure invisibility. Causality is modest but coherent: the tape triggers a purposeful choice that alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: storm → anomalous leaf → intention → surrender → metamorphosis. Orientation is immediate and stable; the drive lens reads primarily accumulative with causal turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (tendrils, slowed thoughts, hybrid state). No stray set-ups or broken logic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear early and the causal chain is clean: insomnia → rain → trails → brooch → Mira → exchange → sleep. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change and conceptual reweighting. The coincidence of Mira’s arrival in the first rain is plausible within the tide/rain constraints. Cost is legible but not severe, keeping the arc quiet rather than high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/why) and the causal chain is tight: reach → activation → shadows → possession. Closure is an on-page decisive change with cost (her body stilled, eyes open anew not as herself). The accumulative sound/setting pattern coheres with a causal turn at the pearl. No major logic gaps, though the inciting grab arrives quickly, minimizing layered tactical attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration with the trumpet’s hum reweighing exile as forging. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the recurring intervals teach the pattern. Closure lands on the page via a charged final image affecting the crowd, though the visible cost is conceptual rather than materially priced. The throughline—find relic, decode, re-present—coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: cracks → railyard → vault → punch → train → boarding. Closure lands via a decisive act (boarding the phantom train), with a conceptual cost (risking the comfort of half-truths) present but not deeply taxed on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the single-scene scope holds. Escalation is linear but purposeful rather than merely “and-then.”

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: transcription → vibrations/visions → dawn repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost (skepticism tempered, grief bridged). Causal links (tile → visions) are clear and concentrated within one continuous scene. No orientation debt; the before/after is legible at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure holds under a Hybrid lens: causal beats (storm → shard → manipulation → breach → recoil) accrue texturally to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean from the outset, and set-ups pay off (the shard, the storm). The cost is present but light (pain, power spent, breach sealed), keeping the ending resonant rather than decisive. No dropped threads or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: wait → breach drawer → use ink → revelation → repricing of father/legacy. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration with an on-page artifact, and the lens holds. The cost is more emotional than situational, and the external risk remains modest, keeping the arc strong but not peak-pressured. Orientation is crisp from the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the lamp’s hum, refracted light, and bonsai archive accrue toward the conceptual turn that his notebook is a “map to reclaim the world,” culminating in his descent. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a decisive step; the before/after is legible. Cost is implied (risk to return), though not textured on the page beyond conceptual terms. Structure is coherent with one continuous build and clean anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural design is clear and steady: fragments mount, tides structure the mosaic, and the final synthesis lands as a resonant reconfiguration of identity. Orientation is strong early and the pattern is taught and kept. The closure’s cost is conceptual—choosing nameless persistence—felt but not cutting; a slightly sharper on-page price would elevate it. The label object’s return and the perch moment cleanly crystallize the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear orientation and a clean accumulative structure: discovery → hums → reimagined voices → reframed quest. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—he leaves altered, carrying the shell as a talisman—with a felt emotional cost. Causality holds through on-page beats; no soft resets. The ending resists mechanics, opting for a resonant image that coheres with the learned pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean accumulative progression: chip → first graffiti → spread of decoding → tightening pressure with patrols → final clandestine vote. The closure is on the page (incorporating on their terms) with a conceptual cost, and the lens holds. A touch more dramatized confrontation or tangible sacrifice at the end would deepen the price. Transitions across nights are legible and causal rather than list-like.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative drive holds: discovery → preparation → vigil → dawn → photo, with the chem-vial’s timed projections adding a functional cadence. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—the photograph taken, the hush preserved at a conceptual cost. The cost is primarily emotional/temporal (last hush) rather than a concrete narrow escape, but it reads on the page. No causal breaks; the hourglass motif is threaded to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean under an accumulative lens: setup → ritual method → mend → release. Closure lands (the drone’s clear bearing), but the felt cost is light and the late meta intrusion about word count breaks immersion at the brink of cadence. Causality holds; the water-refraction method gates the repair. The ending image survives but its charge is dulled by that artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: falcon note → deciphering via phrasebook and window → resolve to set out. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal beats, culminating in a charged-poise ending as he steps into the unknown. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost (choosing risk and remoteness over stasis). Stakes stay coherent and focused, though the cost signal could be intensified.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: footsteps gather, vibration deepens, bells stir, and the final hush reconfigures into breath. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a charged final image (“before the collapse could claim them”), though cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when taught early). The beat-to-beat progression is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight: uncorking the vial triggers the kelp, oxygen dwindles, the hush reframes her tactic, she frees herself, reseals the vial, and boosts the beacon. The closure reads as Charged Poise: options reconfigured from imminent death to credible rescue with a felt cost. The early distress signal pays off without feeling like a deus ex machina because she reactivates it under pressure. Structure holds to a single, escalating scene with legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: the journey inward, confessional act, and charged lattice build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Elias threads his story into the place and departs lighter; the cost is conceptual/emotional and legible. Causality is soft but coherent, with no orientation debts. The “before they find the bodies” clock adds atmosphere more than plot torque.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative pressure holds: bead activation → recurring apparitions → experiments → union. Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost (abandoning life for the spectral realm) and is staged on the page via the bead’s transfer. Orientation is strong from the first lines; set-ups (bead, orchard, runes) pay off. A few summary jumps compress mid-beat causality but do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural build is clean: sleepwalk → discovery → sewing → illumination → communal uptake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the labyrinth redefined and adopted by villagers, with the plate as altar. Causality is gentle but coherent; no link breaks or late conveniences. The felt cost is more conceptual than on-page visceral, which limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: discoveries, interruptions, and work compound toward the rebuilt sundial and renewed belief. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is coherent and unbroken. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rebuilt base charges a before/after shift in faith. Cost is present but soft, leaning more conceptual and effort-based than decisively sacrificial.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterned acts of encoding build to a charged poise as he turns to the post chute. Closure lands via the mailbox outline juxtaposition and the decision to dispatch, with a conceptual price (choosing fragility/tactility over efficiency). Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is felt but not sharp, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and causality holds: flame-guided focus → synchronization → revelations → decision to deliver evidence. The piece reads as hybrid with a dominant accumulative lens, culminating in a charged-poise closure rather than a decisive act. The conspiracy evidence is concretized (secret transmissions, wormhole bribe routes) to validate the turn. Cost at closure is under-voiced, lowering impact despite a coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative design holds: each action (tracing, pressing shard, visions) escalates toward the explicit release. Closure lands on-page with cost as she voices the apology and the window answers, reconfiguring the premise (“The moment returns; decide anew”). Orientation is clear from the outset and the pattern is taught early. No causality breaks; the lens remains accumulative/textural to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the deciphering accrues until the ending’s resonant reconfiguration (“ache softening into quiet resolve”). Orientation is clear early: who/where/when and the anesthetic clock are legible. Closure is on-page and coherent, though the cost is quiet and primarily conceptual. The scene maintains a single throughline without fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: café to daydream to re-emergence with a reweighted stance. Discovery → research (knowledge network) → activation (light-painting) → renewed commitment reads coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change; cost is under-articulated. The meta “count-adjusting” lines briefly puncture immersion but do not break the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clean, with a taught pattern (reflections) building to a conceptual repricing closure. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, what’s at stake) and cause follows choice: she decides to “bewitch,” then the reflections deepen. The closure lands with cost—Elias relinquishes certainty and the formula path is foreclosed. The “pause” clock shapes tactics and keeps pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene causality is clean: arrival → planting → warp → drone pressure → brief resolution → reaffirmed mission. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image (defiance planted, ongoing risk acknowledged). The cost component is mostly conceptual; no concrete sacrifice or irretrievable loss sharpens it. The lens reads Situational with an accumulative textural swell toward the drone beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: postcard incites, ritual singing intensifies, spectral bloom culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The cost—centuries of longing and a truce rather than cure—lands on the page (“insomnia softened into watchful wonder”). Orientation is clean early, and setups (shell acoustics, wind, postcard) pay off causally. One coherent cadence shift at the atrium tightens stakes and reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean single-scene arc: discovery of the cracked tube → choice to mend via song → ignition of the bead → resonant chime with names. Causality holds, and closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis with a felt cost (“a fragile victory” against vast loss). Orientation is immediate and consistent. Stakes remain intimate rather than pressured, but the cadence shift at the end is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene structure is clean, causally linked by the ritual: glyphs → hums → vows → culminating “last knot” unsnarled. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (trust renewed) that’s on the page. However, the cost is light—danger is invoked but not materially tested, so the shift feels earned yet low-risk. Orientation is clear early; the accumulative cadence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure flows causally: amphitheater descent → envelope discovery → adhesive analysis → cipher → reconfiguration of purpose. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the chain reweighted from division to unity. Cost is implied more than dramatized, which softens impact but does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: meteorite discovery → ritualized balancing → test flight → Mira’s arrival → shared messages. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the talisman is jointly claimed and pigeons carry real connections, with vulnerability as cost. Causality is soft but coherent, with each beat deepening options rather than resetting. The ending’s before/after is legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: analysis of the table yields the logbook, whose codes inform the prism alignment that draws her home. Single-POV, one-scene structure with a clean on-page turn supports a Decisive Change at the end. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal assist, and it holds. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which slightly softens the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → alignment → bond → luminous pause → synchronization. The closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration (belonging achieved) but the tangible price is faint. Orientation is strong from the outset, though the meta “recalibrating narrative” aside briefly breaks immersion. Turns arise from presented particulars rather than retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: bird arrival → seed/glass experiment → partial answers → planting → reweighted final script. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she reframes disappearance as neglect/choice and embraces scatter—with a felt price (endurance amidst impermanence). Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the single scene coheres. Stakes are internal but escalate through concrete catalysts rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure reads as a single accumulative scene with a clean orientation and a resonant close (shells as applause, bishop pocketed). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and closure lands as a quiet reweighting, not a decisive change. Causality is coherent (wheel → “shadow dance” → orchestrated cues), but the cost is faint. The ending cadence feels earned, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each step (first line, pain, fledging, second stanza, directing wings) densifies pressure toward a resonant release. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the ritual’s mechanics remain coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the verse fully fledges, reweighting exile into liberation with a conceptual cost (defiance under the ban) and bodily cost (pain). A sharper external consequence would push this higher, but the on-page cadence shift is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural build is clear: dock → pond ritual → prism atrium adjustment → walk back with reweighted understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—seeing his work’s luminous worth before the coming shift. Orientation is strong, but the cost is mostly conceptual, not forcing a hard trade. The throughline remains coherent and contained to a single morning.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene accumulative design is coherent and lands a soft closure when Elias shares and Lena understands. The closure is a conceptual repricing—pain reframed as a shared language—with modest, not visceral, cost on the page. The meta-artifact bracketed lines briefly fracture immersion but don’t break structure. Stakes are internal and resolve in-scene without a decisive external turn.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decorations → trial balloons → refined formula → multiplied emissaries. Orientation is crisp early; causality is coherent within the lyric frame. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (hope as adaptive calculus) with the gauge charged at center, though the on-page cost is light. The progression feels inevitable if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery layers (hum → room → diaries → negative) reweight meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her goal reframes from mapping echoes to mapping repair, with on-page evidence (“the weight settled on her”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Causal links are modest but intact and sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: lullabies → mirror ripples → shimmer → touch → bell toll → reweighted ending. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the heartbeat becomes her own and the mirrors become allies, with the bell as cadence shift. Orientation is clean early; causality between song-codes and mirror response is legible. The cost is conceptual (impermanence acknowledged) rather than concrete but still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene causal thread lands cleanly: Elara convenes leaders, initiates ritual, they sign under celestial alignment, and she pays a personal price. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the live clock (moons and Lirath) focuses the action. Closure is on-page with cost (“she relinquished her role”). A slightly swift capitulation by the leaders is the only soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: the crack-map leads to the basin; hesitation yields the decisive release; rain arrives to erase evidence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR—his self-concept reweighted, with conceptual and potential social cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the lens holds through the ending image. No causal leaps undermine the beat-to-beat flow.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality is clean: approach → untangling (echoes intensify) → unlock → rainbows/shadows (charged poise). Orientation is established early and maintained. Closure lands with a reconfigured field (sanctuary open, pursuit implied), and cost is legible conceptually through the stirred shadows and social peril. One meaningful tightening occurs as threads grow denser and crystals hum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative build from argument aftermath to a clear Decisive Change: renouncing subversive bars for communal fires. Orientation is clean by the opening lines; the radar dome and hush unify the structure. Cost is present but conceptual—abandoning a platform and partnership—rather than dramatized through consequence. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build→gust→charged stillness sequence coheres and lands in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early: who, where, when, and the live clock of the last migration. The closure image (unraveled lattice, wing caught in a final loop, monarchs vanishing) carries felt cost without tidy resolution. Causality is clean; the gust complicates rather than resolves, tightening the frame to an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with accumulative pressure: entry → ritual prep → rebraiding → activation → voices restored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the sanctum speaks and Elara’s stance is reweighted by on-page effect. Causality is clean (card → rope pattern → light → whispers), with a felt conceptual cost tied to guilt and legacy. Stakes are tested through the delicate procedure rather than overt obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: bunker setup → ritual → dream interpretive sequence → reframed understanding → purposeful exit into the storm. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, with closure as a conceptual repricing that reweights her ability’s meaning. Orientation is solid early, and set-ups (seal, directive, storm) pay off. Cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, muting impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clear: discovery → investigation via schematics → ritualized alignment → covenant → aftermath. The accumulative lens holds and the closure lands as a quiet RR/CR with the tile’s dimming and Elias’s altered stance. Cost is implied (binding life’s work to the unknown) but not concretely dramatized. Orientation is strong early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal chain lands clean closure: Elara’s tactic triggers Thorne’s internal reconfiguration, which steadies the world. Orientation is strong early and the lens holds; the decisive change occurs on-page with the object in hand. The cost is emotional and thematic rather than material, but it reads at the ending image. No teleports or breaks; the setup pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: breath, frost, and angle intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as the sextant “flickers to life.” Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure image reframes the ruins as foothills to glass peaks. The cost at closure is subtle (endurance and disciplined attention rather than a decisive loss), limiting upper-band reach. Nonetheless the cadence tightens and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: objects and setting compound toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on-page when the repaired eye reconfigures “vows” as regrowth rather than permanence and a stranger embodies the handoff. Orientation is immediate and clean; the only soft spot is the convenient arrival of the seeker, which the fable-like mode largely supports. Cost is present but subtle, more endurance than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: orchard → bathroom breakthrough → decision → recharged orchard. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she forecloses the curator’s path to chase the inheritance, with conceptual cost (paradox, possible entrapment) on the page. Causality holds (inquiry → vision → knowledge → choice), and anchors are clear early. The price is more implied than tested, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discord from the traveler → research via diary/fern → discovery of coordinates → confrontation/renegotiation → unlocked access → initiation of rescues. Orientation anchors early and the single-scene throughline is legible. Closure is a Decisive Change (path unlocked), though the cost at the end is muted, softening impact. No major teleports, but the ease of the guardian’s capitulation trims tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: narrative-thread attempts cause partial shifts (fog parts, silhouettes emerge), a glimpse of shore, then the ship’s lurch forecloses immediate escape. Orientation is strong from the opening and the closure functions as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. The because/therefore chain is subtle rather than robust, but the cadence tightens into the ending stance. The cost is implied more than felt on the page, keeping it short of top-tier closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene causal chain is clear: forbidden door → tower → rope + seal → rebraiding → anomaly sealed. Closure lands on the page with a legible before/after (runes fading, pendulums synchronizing), under a causal lens. The cost is mostly conceptual and effort-based rather than a wrenching sacrifice, slightly softening impact. Orientation is crisp early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds coherently from disturbance to ritual to hush, with a visible on-page reconfiguration as the beings’ vibrations recede. Orientation (who/where/why) is established early and maintained. Closure lands via the bloom of hush (a decisive change) with a felt relational reset between cave and beings, though the price is modest. The causal chain—arrive, read cracks, enact, bloom—holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Coherent causal throughline: vision → research → shard hunts → storm pressure → alignment → ignition. Closure lands cleanly with a Decisive Change (beacon rekindled) that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is strong early (tower, pavilion, shard), and the drive lens remains causal to the end. Cost is present but light, mostly toil and risk implied rather than dramatized at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm, solid fog, and shadow-readings build toward a Charged Poise ending where she vows and her identity “solidifies.” Orientation is clean from the outset; the ritual provides structural spine. Closure lands with a conceptual cost (vigilance, possible isolation), though not a decisive external turn. One coherent scene with a meaningful tightening (the elongated shadows) earns cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: scent → rag → filtration → ignition → “Rise.” Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (success re-anchors him, community response confirms it). Causality holds throughout, though the win feels assured once the hybrid fuel works, softening the end’s cost. The meta note after the story is a seam but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: the pause, observation, and reflective method build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise when her spoken line reframes Thorne’s transition and the cicada goes “still.” Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than decisional, which softens impact but remains legible. Orientation is clean early, single scene coherence is strong, and no set-up is abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene structure, clean anchors, and an accumulative/textural drive resolve in a charged poise: she preserves the gilded hush as gravity reasserts and faces her father. The hour-long inversion and method-of-limitation furnish concrete constraints that shape action. Closure carries conceptual cost (she keeps a secret counterworld against his bunkers), even if tangible risk is modest. Causality is coherent; the cadence tightens toward the re-contraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc is clean: arrival → embark → looming aether-winds → mist release → deepened quiet → arrival stance change. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal flare at the storm beat; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Lira eases. Cost is gentle and implicit (resource use, disciplined attention) rather than sharply dramatized. Orientation is strong from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is clean: clue-gathering → waterfall → pavilion → ruby dissolving paint → murals → stair → throne before sunrise. Closure lands (she claims the throne), but cost is soft; pressure from the “sunrise” clock is not materially tested. Meta intrusions (“Wait, trim to fit…”) briefly fracture immersion though not causality. Drive lens reads mainly causal with lyric overlay and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene structure is clear: encroachment → ring choice → linking → stabilization → return to stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the threshold stabilizes and the companion breathes, with the ring returned to its hook. Causality holds, though the price feels modest and the solution arrives without meaningful complication. Orientation is early and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: glitch texts → bolt → vent harness → diamonds. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene arc coheres to a decisive act. Closure lands with a visible world-shift and identity reframe, though the ending lacks a sharply felt cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a light accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene structure is clean; the accumulative pattern (music → intuition → search → diary → resolve) coheres. Closure lands with a concrete cost (dissolving estates, loss of titles) and a reweighted status (dynasty ender). The intuitive leap via “standing waves” skirts convenience but is set up and paid off. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery of the program → pattern-tracing → unsnap → cascade of stabilization forms a coherent because/therefore chain. Closure lands on-page with cost: he renounces isolation and accepts a binding allegiance. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp early and maintained. Stakes narrow in time as reality blurs, bringing a satisfying reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the accumulative lens holds as each material discovery tightens meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to transcribe, reweighting her grief into action with a quiet price. The because/therefore chain is modest but coherent (dust seam → hidden record → fuller story → decision). No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal sequence holds: failed signals → puddle-map → lock/key → holotapes → enforcers approach → Kael reappears → renewed plan. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/RR: they commit to dissemination under imminent threat, with a felt—but not fully paid—cost. Kael’s reappearance veers toward convenience, reducing the impression of earned causality. Orientation is steady throughout, and no key setups are dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: density and pattern of silence intensify until the prophecy dissolves. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when) and the closure lands on-page with a felt reconfiguration (RR) and conceptual cost (ending a family-binding dread). The causal throughline (his method answers the code’s structure) holds without contradiction. Cost is more lyrical than concrete, keeping it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: leaf → speck → touch → visions → monuments → clarifying messages → final cascade. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn. The cost at closure is conceptual more than visceral, which softens impact but doesn’t break the arc. Setups pay off, with no causal cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV linear structure is clean, with legible anchors (workshop → greenhouse → cavern) and a coherent accumulative lens reinforced by coincidences. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—taking the compass and choosing a path beyond clocks—while the collapse supplies a tangible test. The cost at ending is light and coincidence drives entry more than agency, but causality within the set-piece holds.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: regret → ritual → coin’s surge → recalibration → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from frantic failure to steadied resolve with the mended crucible as proof and cost. Orientation is anchored early (foundry, rain, vanished apprentice). External quest is deferred, but the internal arc closes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: music draws confession, deepens, and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration as Thorne reaches peace. Orientation is clear from the opening sentences; the scene sustains one continuous window. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost (Elara’s lingering ache and bittersweet joy). No causality breaks; the harp–tooth mechanism threads setup, development, and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: wake → brace → memory surges → conceptual reframing → resolve to walk. Closure functions as a Charged Poise/RR: the decision to proceed along the path after paying pain-cost is legible. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the lens holds. Stakes are tightened through one main deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: detail density builds (glyphs, constellations, scars) to a cadence shift where she unfastens the seal. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration as echoes flood back; cost is conceptual/emotional rather than material but legible through the father’s sacrifice and her vow. Orientation is strong early (market, stall, painting, lens) and the single-scene flow is coherent. Causality is soft but intact: seeing hidden details therefore enables translation therefore unsealing.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-scene arc with a coherent accumulative drive toward revelation and release; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the mid-paragraph meta interjections (“Wait, that's over—adjusting for count... No, recount properly...”) introduce causality wobble between fire vs. embezzlement, marring the throughline. Setups (dust, ceiling, barrel) do pay off, but the stitched corrections reduce decisiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: frost pattern → alcove discovery → bottled whisper → uncorking → awakenings → rupture → captured now. Closure lands on-page with cost: the library’s equilibrium shatters to achieve a timeless stasis, a decisive before/after. The lens reads Causal with accumulative lyric texture, held through the ending image. No orientation debt; the single-scene escalation is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure holds under an accumulative/textural lens: setup of time storms and mirror-covering, development via crafting the ritual, payoff in a reweighted communal myth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing; the world’s rules reweight meaning, and options change as digs resume collaboratively. Cost is implied (truth sacrificed for unity) rather than directly felt on the page, softening impact. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric inflection: chip → tether → doubt quiver → recommitment → restoration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the ending delivers an on-page Decisive Change. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt, but the honesty constraint shapes tactics. The sequence is smooth, perhaps too smooth, with only one brief tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: factory closure → access → descent → find compass → psychometry → reweighted ending. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the compass becomes a “new vial,” recasting her practice. Orientation is clear early. The cost is present but subtle (deferral rather than a decisive sacrifice), keeping it below top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is legible: find slide → visions → carving as intervention → storm eases, with a coherent causal throughline under a lyric, accumulative surface. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the environment shifts and her understanding reprices “perpetual learning.” Cost remains conceptual; the storm’s appeasement comes quickly once she carves, softening consequence. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn visits, melting snow, and layered glass build toward a conceptual repricing at the window. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when anchored) and the postcards/payoff loop is kept. Closure lands on-page with cost (tears, acceptance, chosen artistic direction). The causal thread is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal throughline holds: letters → retrocognitive trap → descent → retrieval → parley → release. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost (risk to body/sanity, earned freedom from the trap) and renewed purpose. The guardian’s demand is resolved swiftly, softening the climax’s resistance but not breaking logic. Orientation is clear from the zeppelin library onward.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens, the sequence from bottle’s depletion → decision to conceive via memory → public invitation → ships’ arrival reads coherent and motivated. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: Elias forecloses escape and magic, commits to the costly path, and the final image confirms traction. Some resolution is summarized (word spreading, ships arriving), softening cost immediacy. Still, the before/after is legible and paid for by renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural structure is coherent: foghorn → immersion → hiss/words → prophecy → repricing. Orientation is clear early, and each move logically deepens the situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reweights his life’s work and alters stance. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not dramatic, but it is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene, accumulative build from chaos to ritual to reopening reads clean and coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vortex stabilizes/reopens and her aim (“texture”) is realized. Causality (decreasing entropy via seeds and runes) holds, though the ending’s price is soft and mostly thematic. Orientation is clear early; no lens or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene structure with a clean temporal spine to zero hour, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. The causal chain—anomalies → hesitation → bell—reads and the repaired rope ties preparation to outcome. Cost is understated but legible: he declines the sanctioned procedure in favor of an older method. The brief “years that followed” coda adds resonance without soft-resetting the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: find shard → activate projectors → empathic reframing → renewed purpose. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with the station and glass charging the last image. Cost is present as a quiet acceptance of solitude’s price and a redefinition of role, though subtle. The causal thread is gentle but coherent with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative drive is clean: ghosts appear → investigation → stained-glass decoding → seam-trace reconfigures the field. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the ghosts straighten and the oasis hum returns. The cost is subtle—maintaining silence to keep the covenant’s gravity—which reads, but lightly. Orientation is clear early and the throughline holds without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality builds cleanly: rediscovery → coded outreach → decoding → reconstruction → activation → transformation. Orientation is stable and the closure is an on-page conceptual repricing with a discernible cost (identity/ledger erased). A live external antagonist never materializes, but the covert framework sustains coherence. The ending’s reconfiguration is legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward the kite-string snap, which functions as a decisive turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the kite is lost—and the feather’s meaning is repriced on the page. Orientation is clean, and the single-scene structure coheres. The causal thread is simple but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (isle caretaker, diagnosis, orchard/pillars), and the accumulative build (work → hum → chamber → web) coheres. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard awakened, pact imagery discovered, and a life extension that reweights the stake. Some cost is summarized rather than dramatized, especially at the end, but the lens holds. The “months later” tag risks softening immediacy yet preserves the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: path → tower interior → pedestal → envoys materialize → conceptual repricing of “homecoming.” Orientation is solid early, and set-ups (footprints, tower, amber) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive change, with a modest conceptual cost. Escalation is present but relatively gentle, relying on image cadence over causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: arrival → decoding birds → targeted fertilizing → sprouts/harmony return. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lens stays textural to a clean Charged Poise closure. Cost is more conceptual than felt, which softens the landing slightly. Still, the cadence builds and resolves with on-page consequence (sprouts and concord’s answering).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure coheres: find cylinder → decode grooves → riddle → revelation about Elara → earned stasis in the “wild hush.” The drive lens reads Accumulative with causal steps; closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (no physical reunion, but a reweighted nearness). Orientation is clean early; set-ups (leaf, instincts, hush) pay off. The only soft spot is the quickness of the Elara-syndicate inference, though it tracks with the “tinted” filter.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene with strong because/therefore flow: glimpse → console activation → hidden coordinates → refocus → apparition → revised sketch. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ritual becomes a map to family, not just memory, with felt emotional price. Orientation is clean from the start; the deck’s rules stay consistent. Stakes remain intimate but coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal drive is clear: corrupted pieces → timed swaps via the sundial → guardians appear → continued swaps → the king swap resolves the fracture. Orientation is excellent early (who/where/when established within the opening). Closure is a decisive change with the world righting and Lirra’s nod. The cost reads as risk and strain rather than a lasting price, keeping it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of walking → intensifying whispers → resistance coils → sharper pattern (“sever”) → archive unbound. Closure lands on the page with a felt constraint and a conceptual price (curating without unleashing vengeance). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causality breaks. The cost is modest but legible in the ankle-bind and the ethical curation choice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: nightly substitutions and decoding build to the final invocation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: illusions shift from escape to bridge, with the cost of integrating painful memory made explicit. Setups (stone/feather/thunder) pay off cleanly at the mountain-core climax. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no critical gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coherent causal chain: tapestry decoding → entrance → maze navigation → illusions → mirror absolution → slight thaw. The closure lands on-page with cost (facing spectral accusations) and a charged final image (a villager’s eye twitch). A mostly single-thread drive lens holds with one scene transition handled cleanly. Some steps (decoding speed, illusions’ dispatch) feel a touch convenient but do not break escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent, with a legible clock (“before the ritual”) and a closure beat that functions as Charged Poise: echoes softened, chorus carried, options reweighted. Causality is accumulative rather than plot-turn driven, but the lens holds and the cost is on-page. The spire’s flicker at the end effectively tightens the cadence without a hard turn. Minor softness remains around concrete consequences beyond the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each memory-scar pairing thickens pressure until the charged final exhale reconfigures the scene (workshop steadies). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual and bodily cost (breath, exposure to acid, acceptance of failure). Causality is clean within the ritual’s logic. The price is felt but modest, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV, coherent progression: wrong turn → discovery → painting → fading light → vow → return. Lens reads accumulative/textural with a clean closure via Charged Poise/Earned Stasis as he articulates the vow and carries the shell back. Causality is tidy—no unkept setups; the skylight’s fading light supplies a natural tightening. Minor constraint: the stakes remain interior, so the structural turn is more cadence shift than decisive reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the method is prepared, enacted, and answered through an image-pattern shift (gulls, mental warmth), then sealed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he gains actionable knowledge for the next fog and affirms his premise. Orientation is clear from the start; sequencing is coherent with one tightening (uncork → wait → sign → recork). The on-page cost is modest (risk of futility, finite opening/recorking), keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: hydraulics failure → resolve to build a human beacon → repeated midnight calls → doubt under waning moon → tangible payoff as families depart inland. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he remains to signal, costed by solitude and ongoing effort, reweighted by arrivals and the final dialing. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the censer foot and lunar cycle persist into the ending image. The price is felt on the page, not merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single-POV arc: discovery of the glass eye → research and preparation → self-surgery → aftermath. The closure is a decisive change with cost, and the lens reads primarily causal with lyrical accumulation. Setups (smuggled relic, textbooks) pay off; no soft reset. The cost is explicitly felt during the implant and thematically priced in the final measured-speech beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: sighting the boutonnière → investigation via memory gaps → reweighted understanding → charged final pinning. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a modest but legible cost. The memory rule is introduced and paid off on the page. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is clear: ants → chip/map → cavern → archway → insertion → visions/step through. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the rising creek provides a time-pressured throughline. Closure lands on-page with a decisive step and reconfiguration of his life’s stance. The cost is implied (risk/farewell to solitude) rather than sharply dramatized, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain is clean: warning → clandestine climb → encounter → grotto → vision of curse → incantation sealing. Closure lands on-page (Decisive Change), and the drive lens holds. The cost at closure is mostly implied (lingering mark) rather than tested in-scene, blunting impact. Spatial/temporal anchors are solid and the single-scene arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is coherent: confession → proposed fusion → infusion → reweighted symbol. Closure lands on-page via a resonant reconfiguration (the shell becomes beacon) with a conceptual cost (letting go of loss-as-cage). Orientation is firm early; cause/effect is consistent with the lyric mode. The cost remains more thematic than visceral, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: waking shock → writing ritual → on-page reconfiguration (“jealousy eased into understanding”). Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as a resonant repricing with cost. Stakes remain internal but cohesive; no causality breaks. Minor softness in how “earned” the peace feels is the only limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog → object handling → interpretive reframing → polishing → pocketed talisman. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost: the anosmia remains; meaning is reweighted, not solved. Orientation is clear from the outset; the single-scene arc tightens cleanly. Stakes stay intimate but coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual actions compound until the final rune catalyzes transformation. Orientation is early and clean (floating tea platform, elder, storm horizon) and the closure (crystals dissolving, final rune: transformation) occurs on the page. The cost—reentering traumatic memory and enduring physical ache—is legible if modest. No causality breaks; set-ups (crow feather, vow, tears in ink) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is tight: perfume → currents → Theo’s partial return → apology → machinery intrudes → charged parting. The causal chain holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with the demolition clock pressing the scene. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: reconciliation achieved but impermanent, with the orchard’s fall as cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: layered “spiral arbitration” builds to an RR/CR where illusions shatter and the cosmos is reconfigured. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the dictionary throughline provides coherence. The closure lands on-page, but the price for this reconfiguration reads more conceptual than costly. Still, the because/therefore of tactics via etymology sustains structural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: setup of routine → key discovery → backward counting → reversal → conceptual repricing. Closure lands on page with cost (blood, whistle reprise), reweighting what clocks measure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality is dream-logic but taught and consistent. A slightly over-explicit thesis line softens the turn’s inevitability but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal through-line is clean: alert → pursuit → encounter → tool use → conceptual reveal → reconfigured stance. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: she reframes security and personal grief via entanglement. The resolution is mostly internal and lightly didactic but coherent for the length. A late meta-artifact sentence breaks immersion but not causality.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: successive scrawl-interpretations deepen pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the lantern extinguishing delivers closure with conceptual cost. The causal chain is light but coherent under the chosen lens. Minor repetition in reflective mode doesn’t disrupt the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent accumulative drive toward Clara’s decision to release rather than mend. Closure lands on the page with cost: the call ends, dawn approaches, and the disc still vibrates as the bond dissolves. The conversation and harmonica escalate in a purposeful spiral. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory accretion and object returns build toward the decision to “regenerate the covenant” and begin the work. Orientation is clear from the outset, and transitions (jetty to archive) are legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—reflection becomes action—though the on-page cost is conceptual rather than sharply felt. Causal threads (photo → journals → vow) are plausible and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: rumor → climb → communal sharing → renunciatory exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (connection found in sharing) with cost (he still leaves). Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when), and set-ups (rumor, tower) pay off on-page. The note edges toward neatness but doesn’t undercut the earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: notes layer, pressure concentrates, and the ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration at the stillpoint. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established) and the closure occurs on the page. Cost is primarily internal but legible in the turn from guilt to forgiveness. The causal chain is soft-by-design yet coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV causal progression is clean: discovery → activation → targeted edit → reconfigured outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—cradle not cage—with a conceptual price (fragility, meddling with time). The cost is modest and the tool works on first try, softening the decisive turn. Orientation is strong and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mapping silence builds toward a reconfiguration where Elias translates quiet into song. Closure lands on the page with cost—public vulnerability and a felt before/after in being unseen vs. briefly witnessed. Orientation is crisp and consistent, one continuous scene with a clean cadence shift when fishermen become audience. No causal slips or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: tapestry → mural → portrait → cameos → mosaic → codex. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she accepts the codex and vow, but the cost is soft and largely emotional. Meta intrusions about word counts in the final stretch dent the effect and slightly disturb closure poise. Orientation is solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural design escalates cleanly: perch → intensifying drumming → move to the lagoon as nexus → cosmos exhales and she lands in earned stasis. Closure lands with cost—she keeps drumming while accepting the dream’s survival only in her. Orientation is strong early and consistent. Causality is lyrical but coherent, with tactics altering options at the lagoon.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: storm scrambles navigation → Marco’s wager strands him → Elias tracks gait, uses folded map, then coin-lock to extract him. The hidden mechanism is pre-seeded and character-plausible, avoiding deus ex machina. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias proves his principle and resumes patrol. Cost is mostly conceptual and situational rather than felt on the body, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the ritual intensifies, imagery densifies, and the final repricing of darkness lands as closure. Orientation is clear early (dock, boathouse, mist), with one continuous scene that tightens around the mirror-and-shutters tactic. The cost is conceptual—reframing grief—and it’s legible in the final “tool” carry. A hair soft on decisive choice, but the cadence shift and reweighting are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: library → town → grotto → synchronized lights → charged ending. Causality is soft but coherent; the displays lighting at eight provide the primary hinge, and the final grotto tableau reads as a Charged Poise with implied cost. Orientation is solid from the outset, and patterning remains legible. The cost is largely conceptual (risk of reprisal) rather than enacted, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: crate → scrimshaw beacon → whale call → island emergence → transformation. Single-POV, two-shard feel remains coherent and orients early. Closure lands as a decisive change with a felt, if mostly conceptual, cost. A touch more on-page consequence (e.g., a concrete goodbye) would heighten the price.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds pressure via patterned hush, performance, and craft culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending. Orientation is immediate (farmhouse, turbines, post-mandate), and the closure is legible when the carved bird joins the bouquet and “lightness ghosted” through the void. Cost is implied as endurance and the refusal to feel fully—subtle but present. No causal turn, but a clear cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the hum → paraphrase → environmental dissolution → crossing forms a clear progression. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration, with the world remade in “softer, boundless beauty.” Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene structure is tight. The cost at closure is subtle, more conceptual than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: plant overtures → discovery of reed tongue → proposal → collaboration → anniversary performance → transfer/return of awakening. Closure is a decisive change with a charged image (the glass singing as Thorne’s clarity returns), though the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lens holds. A single, purposeful tightening suffices, even if no major reversal tests commitment midstream.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each questioned assumption unlocks a deeper sound-layer, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when her bell’s final ring carries communal connection. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when and the lab’s rules), and the prop chain (bell → lens → simulator) stays coherent. Closure is on-page via a Charged Poise/CR: the last bell and the etched lens signal a before/after. Cost is subtle (repricing grief), not a hard trade, but legible within this quiet design.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with causal steps (stencil → origami → gift → telescope alignment → illumination) accumulating to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page through the beam parting the “curtains of intention,” with conceptual cost tied to grief and guarded hope. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds. The price is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is crisp early (loft, rain, post-crash city; Elara and Theo) and the structure coheres as one scene with a demonstration. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: ideas and images accrue toward a conceptual reweighting at dawn. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—mapping over predicting—but the cost is implied rather than keenly felt. Causal links hold, with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern-avoidance ritual escalates into visions, then the spectral child and conceptual repricing. Closure lands with cost (she surrenders innocence to gain truth) on the page. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pagoda’s unlocking beats track coherently. Minor abstraction in the “equations/rites” passage skirts summary but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual comparison of archival footage intensifies pattern awareness until the shadow reconfigures into a bloom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a modest cost (momentary victory against an ongoing erosion of hope). Orientation is strong early; the single-scene flow is coherent. Stakes resolve on the page without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative structure coheres: tactile ritual and “shedding layers” deepen until the decisive choice to report Mira and recommit lands. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with cost—loss of naivety and a foreclosed partnership. Orientation is immediate and stable; the night-to-dawn arc gives temporal spine. External confrontation is off-page, but the internal decision has clear stakes and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: wake → plant whisper → descend → dig → chamber → opal to scar → conceptual shift and hourglass thaw. Closure lands on-page with cost (physical strain, tears) and a decisive reconfiguration of meaning. Orientation is firm within the first lines; the lens stays causal through the end. Slight luck in the chamber’s existence is buffered by prior cues (plants, grounds, heirloom).

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link coherently: entrance → object handling → psychometry → vision of Theo → conceptual pinpointing → vow. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (unused love stored in negative space) with felt cost, and the pattern (lyrics searching; incubation) is taught early and pays off. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure holds. The causal pressure is quiet but consistent, never breaking the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tracing meteors → intensifying unspoken words → conceptual shift to surrender → RR closure. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure is on-page via the act of rest and the charged rise, though the cost remains mostly conceptual. The set-ups (aurora, astrolabe, falling stars) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure coheres: he discovers/uses the archive via the clock-anchor, triggers branching, and chooses renewal, yielding a reweighted world image and lingering cost. The drive lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative finish; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (renewal chosen, curse endures). Orientation is anchored early (guard, locomotive, dunes, archive) and the causal chain holds. Abstraction around mechanics stays legible through consistent object-action linkage (pressing the clock to the crate).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sixth sense → rainforest immersion → translocation → wind-method → gear → core reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (home to himself; hum eternal) tied to established motifs. Cost is present but light (exhaustion, disorientation), tempering the heft of the before/after. Orientation is clean early; transitions are legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the leash break triggers a guided, curving progression to the cove where a reconfiguration lands (claiming courage, hound found, final star punched). Orientation is clean and the pattern (indirect routes) is taught early and paid off at closure. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not deeply taxing, but it’s visible on-page via the star-punched card and the leash’s “ghost” dissolving. Structure remains coherent with a single throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ascent, the smudge, the bolt, and the memory sequence deepen pressure and culminate in an Earned Stasis/Repricing closure. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final choice carries conceptual cost. The causal throughline is quiet but coherent; nothing contradicts the ending’s logic. A single, meaningful tightening (discovery → acceptance) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative pattern—messages → readers compelled → Varak drawn → rune activation—lands in an on-page decisive change with the pretender dissolved. Causality is coherent, and the closure is legible with the stars resuming motion. The on-page cost is more conceptual than felt; Elowen risks exposure but doesn’t pay a visible price. Still, the structure holds cleanly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: present-time assembly leads to a discovery that reweights prior data. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (paths shifted not vanished), with a quiet cost (ongoing rise, loneliness) implied. Orientation is early and clean. Cost is modest but legible; the meta intrusion near the end slightly scuffs the clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: stargazing → anomaly engagement → vision → decision to send signals. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: a reconfiguration of options and a commitment to risk. Cost is largely conceptual, not dramatized, which keeps the turn quiet. The meta line (“But wait, that exceeded—trimming back…”) nicks momentum but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: plants → kite → decoding → cavern → unsealing → embryo awakening. Orientation is strong and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (defying tradition) more than an on-page price. No major teleports or broken set-ups. Slight deduction as the price of the act remains largely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the arboretum approach through the glasshouse to the charged final walk; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she carries the same photo differently, with the cost of acknowledging randomness. The sequence tightens at the freeze, then deepens via the orchid sketch and lighthouse image. No causality breaks; the quiet cadence shift is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: discovery of the broken tarot, decision to untangle, memories surfacing, and a reconfigured end-state. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/why), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a tangible tactic (binding the deck anew). Cost is mostly emotional (severing threads tied to losses), not fully dramatized but legible. No causality breaks; the beats link coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.6)
    Drive lens reads predominantly Causal (ink → map → canyon → confrontation → tactical disappearance), but the closure collapses into meta commentary: “Wait, that’s over—adjusting…,” which breaks the fictive frame and undercuts cost. The declared answer (“time slowed to forge survivors’ resolve”) arrives as tell rather than dramatized consequence, diminishing Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The sorcerer scene resolves quickly and offloads the key revelation to the drone feed, weakening on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: unauthorized thaw → discovery of letter → moral calculus → transmission → charged aftermath. Closure lands on the page with the completed send and the library’s hush reweighted, a clear Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Consequences are deferred, but the conceptual cost is undeniable in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual detail accrues toward a charged final image where calm stabilizes the crack. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the sandbag-to-soil sequence tracks. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise rather than a decisive change; cost is implied rather than dramatized. The mystical causal link is coherent within the story’s stated method, if a touch convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene structure holds with a coherent Hybrid lens (accumulative texture plus causal beats). The closure lands on-page: he hooks the echo, the garden re-harmonizes, and his inner fractures mend. Causality is intact (tactic → hook → surfacing echo), but the felt cost at the climax is understated, making the victory comparatively smooth. Orientation is firm early; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: call → observatory → confrontation → debunking. Closure lands with a decisive exposure and conceptual repricing (“orbits of regret” disperse), but the proof mechanism is shaky, reducing felt cost. Orientation is strong early; pressure remains coherent. The ending clarifies stakes but avoids a meaningful price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean: discovery (letters) → tool (device/firmware) → action (tether) → reweighting (translation reveals fear, not accusation). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and closure lands with cost as her guilt is reframed on the page. Orientation is anchored early (lab, letters, device) and transitions are legible. The curse warning adds pressure without derailing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: chaos → intervention → collaborative pattern → hush with lingering unease. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis/charged poise): the group settles, yet fragility remains (“easily scattered by the next gust of forgetting”). Causality holds through consistent motif use (acoustics, sand, chalk). Cost is conceptual more than personal, but legible in the fragile equilibrium the ending preserves.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the stone cues vision → decoded ritual → renaming → plaza’s response → gathered survivors. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration; the price is her deeper entanglement with retrocognition. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene arc is coherent. Slight softness in causal tightening keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the accumulative/textural drive holds. The coin offer and the echo-dance produce a coherent on-page reconfiguration: despair recedes as possibilities flicker. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with a modest but felt cost (risk, surrender to the uncanny). Causal links are clean even within a lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: static shock → idea → devised method → exposure → developed print → reweighted meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“No pills needed”) with an on-page sequence showing tactics shaped by earlier set-ups. The cost is modest but legible: they relinquish the shortcut in favor of vulnerable, embodied connection. Orientation is crisp from the start; no causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: exploration → hotspot → fossil → amplified mapping → redefined role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she assumes the herald stance with future-facing consequence. Causality is clean, though the price of the shift is mostly inferred rather than dramatized. Orientation is solid early and the lens remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the button-cataloging gradually harmonizes the jar’s echo and culminates in a reweighted stance (share the prophecy). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with a clear before/after: hoarded prophecy vs. disseminated possibility. Causality is clean—each step with the buttons clarifies the echo—though on-page cost is implied more than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when set within ~120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean single-scene causality: return → decode → signal → confrontation → alliance. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (they choose to fix and expose together), but the price remains soft and the tension spike (footsteps) resolves without friction. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds; stakes are legible yet lightly tested. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the gutters’ ticking, fog delay, and ambient cues build to a resonant reconfiguration where he redefines the vow and proceeds. Orientation is solid throughout. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing with a clean final image (ledger line, fog lifting), though the cost is more implied than dramatized. The ferry call provides a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: object thrums → visions fracture → selection of a throughline → conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is established early (who/where/when), and the lantern’s cause-and-effect is clean. Closure lands as a conceptual shift with a gentle price (relinquishing possession of the “answer” for a stance). Stakes remain contained but coherent across the lyric structure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (fire escape, city, rosebush; then harbor and rowboat), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: scattering petals and lifting the hush culminate in a credible new resolve with an implied cost (releasing the father-tethered rose). Causal links are clean: final petal → decision → harbor ritual → reweighted stance. The cost is felt but modest, fitting the quiet design.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: discovery → ascent → ritual → spectral coexistence → return and launch. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step deepens pressure and reweights the stake, culminating in an on-page choice (spreading long-unused wings). Causality between sundial, solstice alignment, and the circle’s hum is legible. The cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral, which tempers impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of images (pond/spiral/letters) coheres to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands on-page with a before/after: Elara shifts from isolation to rejoining, with a felt cost of vulnerability and surrender of anonymity. Causal links are soft but adequate (temple convergence → installation → letter → reunion). The coincidence of the perfectly addressed envelope narrows options quickly, slightly reducing pressure but not closure quality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: Harlan demands a shutdown; Elara counters by injecting subsonics; the crowd and signal respond, producing an altered end-state. Closure lands on-page with a palpable before/after (“first honest silence in weeks”). The cost is more social/ethical than personal but still felt in the uneasy crowd reaction. No major orientation or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Anchors are solid early (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: compass engagement → organ reverberation → mapped seam → Keystone. The single-scene arc maintains coherence and pays off on-page with a decisive change (she acquires the artifact). Cost is primarily emotional, not material, so the resolution risks feeling easy. Still, the structure tightens once through the organ’s activation and lands with legible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the single-scene causal line holds: evidence purge → quarry search → ribbon recovery → empathetic reconstruction → plan to confront the detective. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: her sketch reframes the case’s meaning and commits her to action. The “ink stain match” inference reads thin and largely asserted, softening cost. The drive lens leans accumulative with causal steps; it coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is legible: journals + nail → decoded proof → query → reversal → final image. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and a resonant image (nailing the copper to the map). The washed-ashore crate is a fortunate arrival that edges toward convenience, softening the pressure-cost balance. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: hitchhiker vanishes → flake discovery → scaffold map → hidden bridge → playing as transformed act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decisive change, with cost implied (risking former “never”) rather than dramatized. Orientation is crisp early, and the single-scene arc stays coherent. The magical convenience of the scaffold-map is accepted but softens the sense of earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: inheritance → startup rise → rival incursion → symbolic deterrence → economic fall → reflective repricing. Causality holds and the mid-turn (dissuading rivals) arises from established traits and props, while the final beat registers cost (the dream falters) and reframes the premise. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative close; closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis that’s legible on the page. No orientation debt despite a time span, thanks to clear anchors and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: observatory → lucid entry → star-driven witnessing → inscription reveal → dawn understanding. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing (she reframes her chronicles as communal healing). The on-page cost is subtle rather than felt, which keeps the ending from fully spiking. Still, build and cadence are coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: failed trick → discovery of seed → deliberate unbend via expanding circles → lake’s reconfiguration and visions → collected seed/earned stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with the lake and her heart “straightening.” Cost is implied (danger of the seed/lake, moral weight of truth) but not deeply exacted on the page. The single-scene structure is clear and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk → rift → linking via scars → vision-guided reconnection → eclipse lifts. Orientation is clean from the opening; causality is consistent (wind call, clipping, scars as conduit). Closure lands on-page with a felt change (covenant restored, eclipse lifts) and a small, tangible price (clipping spent). Stakes resolve without a hard reversal, but the cadence tightening reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain holds: Elara enters with an aim, meets Thorne, uses the card with the roots, and achieves a barter culminating in the card’s dissolution. Closure lands on the page with a visible change (Thorne solidifies; the card crumbles) and a conceptual reweighting. The cost reads mainly as sacrifice of the talisman; the emotional price remains relatively gentle. Orientation is early and stable, with one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: humiliation → refuge → talisman decision → reframed purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the quarry re-seen as an archive and the cloth kept, not discarded. Cost is understated but legible—he foregoes the clean severing of the past in favor of bearing it. Orientation is clear and consistent within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: loss → discovery → inquiry → planting → resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “transition” and chooses a grounded act, gaining peace. The cost is conceptual—relinquishing grasping for understanding—felt but not sharp. Causality is clean, orientation clear early, and no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: world premise → creel arrival → gentle harvest → smelting → cataloging, closing on an earned stasis/charged poise. Closure lands via the day’s harvest completed and the ongoing vigil affirmed, with a conceptual cost (self-blurring to save identities) on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set-ups (moon phases, creel, migrating identities) pay off. Escalation is a density/deepening rather than a causal reversal, but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: find shell → read confessions → pearl awakens → decision to embed → cave transforms. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (he abandons his old mandate), though the cost is more implied than felt. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens (accumulative/casual hybrid leaning accumulative) holds. The ending’s promise is legible without mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: station → timetable → graffiti → accordion culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page via the playing and the decision to carry the accordion forward; cost is the choice to live with unmedicated clarity and memory. Some convenience in discoveries (board, graffiti, accordion) is smoothed by the accumulative lens. Orientation is crisp from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: letter → cipher → watch-delays → coordinates → library → charged pause for the second letter. The closure is a resonant interim arrival (Charged Poise) with the looming second letter; cost is implied as patience and wariness, not forcefully dramatized. Orientation is clear early. The because/therefore chain is intact if light on friction.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build: stains → plant whispers → play → vision → choice. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and the closure lands with an on-page act that reconfigures options. Cost is present as the foreclosed imperial path, though it remains conceptual rather than concretely priced. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: the aurora intensifies, patterns resolve, the threshold nears, she acts, and the chip receives her essence. Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the before/after is legible (self to gem) with on-page cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and causal threads (pattern-finding → infusion) hold. The single-scene focus maintains coherence without stray subplots.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of care → climb → relic → vision → resolve coheres to a Conceptual Repricing closure. The hairpin’s coincidence is acceptable as a catalyst, though it softens causal pressure. Orientation is clean and the single-scene flow lands a clear before/after. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional and modest but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene structure with clean anchors moves from arrival to ritual to decisive act. The accumulative/textural lens holds: chime patterns + Thorne’s framing reweight the binary job dilemma. Closure is on-page: she unhooks the cloak, with a felt before/after. Cost is present but soft (foreclosing rigid certainty rather than a concrete external price).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ripples → rings → final warning culminate in a charged poise. Orientation is clean; the grotto’s pull and the platform’s trance anchor the pattern. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a palpable implied cost, though not viscerally paid. One scene, one stake, one cadence shift—coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is cleanly single-scene with an accumulative lens: find artifact → read birds → merge pulse → reconfigured stance. Orientation is firm early (who/where/what) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is mostly conceptual (choosing rooted vigilance; a restless pulse that promises trials) rather than dramatized pressure. The throughline holds, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from discovery to release, descent, placement, and reprise. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the sacred resides in simplicity, not algorithmic spectacle, with an on-page price (risk and renunciation of safety). The sequence holds cause→effect coherently, with no orientation debt. While quiet, the final return image tightens meaning without mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coherent causal chain: lantern release → warmed tag → dive → library → key-tag unlock → orb revelation → transformed return. Closure lands as a decisive change/conceptual repricing with the tag spent and his role redefined. The “hides behind truth” line reads grafted, not an engine in the causal spine. Cost is present but soft, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: lots → interpretation of static → distillation → mandate of sacrifice → decisive act. Closure lands on the page with cost (coins cast into the void) and a lingering charged poise in the doubt that remains. Orientation is firm from the outset (ambered observatory post-contraction) and maintained. One slight convenience—revelation naming “sacrifice”—reads a hair declarative but holds within the established method.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: recordings → ritual assembly → crystallization → reweighted purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—continuing without Lira, guided by her echo, is a constrained after. Because/therefore linkages hold (old recordings therefore gramophone and light refraction, therefore naming, therefore transformation). No orientation debt; the persistent constraint of Lira’s absence shapes the final tactic and image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain is clean: find bell → read drip cadence → infuse/repair → toll → waters return. Single-scene focus and clear stakes carry to a decisive on-page change. Cost is under-articulated at closure—success arrives without a meaningful trade-off—keeping it out of the top band. Orientation is crisp and consistent with the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the photo trail densifies meaning until the grandfather image triggers a reweighing. Closure lands on-page as he stages the communal reveal and reframes the town’s submergence, with a conceptual cost (forsaking a family grudge). Orientation is brisk and stable; no causality breaks. The convening resolves smoothly, skimming some friction that might have deepened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: need → flame on crystal → starlings’ omen → elixir/realization → poised ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reweights her method, readying for the external “final transformation.” Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and maintained. Cost is emotional rather than material, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: anomaly spotted → reassessment → revision → transmission → stabilization of defenses/trust. Single-scene focus, clear orientation, and a legible tightening when the “benign drift” flips to sabotage. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis—trust preserved for now, burden persists. A sharper on-page price or narrowed option would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: Kai infiltrates, dispels illusions, slices the field, and enacts the fusion that reconfigures stakes. Closure lands on the page via a decisive change: the brain vivifies into a body and Kai’s numbness breaks with visible emotional cost. A slight convenience lurks as “the corporations’ claims dissolved in the chaos,” softening external consequence. Still, the single-scene escalation is coherent and resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: storm → retreat to haven → seed planted → ideation → prototype. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—planting as inception of a business rebirth—though on-page cost is soft. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when anchored within the first lines). The sequence is coherent, with one meaningful tightening at the planting decision and a next-day payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: he enters, assembles tools, confronts the grief-vines, escalation via tunnel resistance, and a clear on-page resolve as laughter rises. The drive lens reads Hybrid with accumulative textural pressure and causal linkage intact. Closure lands (Decisive Change) but the cost at the ending is modest, limiting the high band. Orientation is clean from the first lines and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative structure flows cleanly: wait → memory of cultist → discovery of pendant → acceptance method → path opens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/decisive step, with the pendant charging the final image. The cost is mostly conceptual and could be felt more viscerally, but the chain remains coherent and paid off on the page. Orientation is solid early, and backstory ties directly to the present turn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal spine holds: successive approximations lead to the insight that creation must ride on the wake of destruction, culminating in a transformed crozier and a decisive turn outward. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing of faith/tool. Orientation is clear from the outset; the lens remains consistent. Cost is present but soft (abandoning inherited role is asserted more than tested).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV, one-scene accumulative structure is clean; orientation is quick and stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “a shard of hush” reweights the premise and her creed with an earned renunciation. Because/therefore linkages hold (discarding assumptions → signal coherence → visions of renewal). The cost is internal and mild but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: sideways clocks → grotto → dissolving ferry → hourglass and wall-patterns → radio merge → reemergence. Orientation is solid from the opening and the single POV holds, with one purposeful scene transition into the underworld. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change and a lingering conceptual cost (“permanent whisper”), though the price is more atmospheric than consequential. The “artifact as key” beat is brisk but remains causally planted via the grandfather tale.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural causality is clean: weaving patterns intensifies pressure until emotion erupts and reweights the premise, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid early (who/where/why), and each beat “therefore” accrues density. Closure carries cost on the page—memories altered, mirrors fractured, and an earned after-image of changed understanding. A singular micro-choice at the brink of eruption could make the pivot even more surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, culminating in a charged poise: Elara returns with the link, the city stirred, and a new way forward implied. Orientation is strong and the throughline is coherent (discovery → method → demo → simulations → communal hope). Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft, more melancholy than a tangible price. The sequence relies on summary beats rather than on-page turns, which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal throughline is clean: tip → investigation → discovery → realization → confrontation. Orientation is strong and the closure lands with a tangible decision that preserves the atrium. Cost is underplayed—Mira’s acceptance is too smooth—softening the impact of the final turn. Still, the locket/photo/hearing-aid chain pays off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain from entry to activation to release, with orientation anchored early and a legible closure (codex dissolves; apparitions depart; he escapes at tide turn). The drive lens reads primarily causal with a textural overlay. Slight ease in the core activation and minimal complication at climax keep it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: shatter → ink interface → scan/defrag → stabilized ghost and heartbeat → re-opened connection. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the drive lens holds through closure. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (Elias stabilizes) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara’s regained poise). The cost is modest but legible (blood, isolation, risk of losing Elias during erratic beats).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural structure builds toward a charged closure where the language’s textures become sound in the tunnel—a clean RR/CR on the page. Orientation is strong early; single POV, one dominant stake, and a coherent escalation. Cost is legible (curse visions, diamond dimming) and integrated. A hair more consequence on Elar’s body or options would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: discovery → phone confessions → arrowhead activation → gravity shift → metamorphosis. Orientation is strong early and the closure is an on-page decisive change with a conceptual repricing of “curse” to “invitation.” The cost (leaving prior life) is implied rather than dramatized, modestly reducing weight. Lens reads hybrid leaning causal, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: music → heart-signal amplification via shell → statues’ stasis → roots uproot anchors → orchard revives. Orientation is established early and held; a single continuous scene drives to an on-page, decisive change. Cost is present but modest; still, the closure lands clearly with the orchard’s reanimation and statues’ collapse. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric texture and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset, and the accumulative lens holds: setup (arcade, letters, crate) → activation (drone launch) → reverberation (return flutter) → reconfiguration (recommitment). The closure lands as a quiet RR/CR rather than a decisive change; cost is implied through risk, not paid on-page. Causal threads (bottled storm fuels breach) are tidy with no teleports. Escalation is contained but coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive tightens from exploration to discovery to the compelled song, closing on a resonant reconfiguration: the halo embeds, the train’s “heart” promises rebirth. Orientation is clean early; cause-and-effect is cohesive (fragment hums → singing → transformation). The cost is emotional (breaking silence) and conceptually legible, though lightly rendered. The single-scene arc satisfies scope with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative design is clean, with anchors established early and a coherent progression from preparation to activation to vision. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she glimpses the “eternal archive” and reframes where stories live. The cost is subtle (a quiet endurance of solitude), which keeps the impact shy of the very top. Causality is consistent within the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: gathering tools → dawn capture → projection → deciphering → reorientation to release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost, on the page in the palette image fading and her acceptance. Orientation is clean early; pattern stays coherent across the two-shard structure (shore and darkroom). Stakes remain internal but the because/therefore linkage of actions is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: star hint → offering the hair → disorienting unlock → reconfigured resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the “before/after” is legible when fear cracks and the ribbon is retied. Causality is mystical but coherent under the taught pattern; no orientation debt. Cost is modest (emotional surrender rather than a hard trade), but it’s on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene structure holds cleanly: desire → approach → discovery → deciphering → recovery. The accumulative lens fits, with environmental density building to the portal’s activation. Closure lands on-page with the hum and memory-flood; cost registers as bittersweet reclamation rather than a hard trade-off. The path feels a touch convenient (the ring appears quickly), but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal flow holds: shadow → ritual → annotation → handoff → loosening → Elara’s shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptually legible cost (risking herself to mentor and re-enter motion). Orientation is clear early; no teleports. The cost is a touch light for 9-band but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → essence-capture → planting → bloom affecting villagers. Closure lands with the seed’s flowering and communal impact, but the cost is faint and untested. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and causality is legible within the lyric mode. The decisive act (planting) reconfigures the world, yet without a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene accumulative design holds: unraveling knots → released hush → confession → brother’s partial manifestation → final knot and grounding. Closure lands on-page with cost (the confession of jealousy/culpability) and a visible reconfiguration (spirits grounded, peace attained). Orientation is clean early. Persistent constraint (the net’s knots) shapes tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal throughline is clean: footage comparison ⇒ pattern recognized ⇒ on-site verification ⇒ latch opened. Two-shard structure (vault to henge) is legible and momentum holds. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (door opens) that reconfigures options and honors the drive lens. Cost is present but light; still, the chain of causes is satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: Earhart wreck → ship library → radio and note → faint playback → ascent with repriced understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a clear before/after stance (“release, not the grasp”). Cost is largely conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, but it reads on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene flow is coherent: discovery → translation via graffiti → release of the ghost. Closure lands on the page as the ghost emerges; the causal chain holds. The cost is largely conceptual rather than felt, but the before/after is legible. The accumulative/textural lens is steady, with the storm window providing a soft ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure (floors 1–10) teaches its pattern and pays off with a quiet reconfiguration at the doors opening. Causality holds (goggles → scattered light → unfolding diary), and orientation is clean from the outset. Closure is a Charged Poise/RR, but the on-page cost is soft—ethical trespass and risk are implied rather than felt. The recalibration beat (“Wait, too far…recalibrating her count”) adds a nice micro-turn without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative drive holds: the snapped tether initiates a lyric ascent of pressure to a conceptual repricing at dawn (“the proof settle like sediment”). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/CR: he accepts a reweighted world where emptiness archives loss, pays with risk and renunciation of protocol. Orientation is clean early; the auxiliary descent provides a concrete outward beat to balance the inward turn. Slightly on-the-nose declaration of “He had proven it” blunts the final image’s autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean accumulative structure: dawn tension → coin → seam → book → applied technique → completion under rumble → exit as demolition begins. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (library lost, spirit preserved; she carries the book). Causality is plausible and motivated; the coin’s pattern-match risks convenience but is grounded in her fractal attention. The lens holds to the end without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean single-POV causal line from rumor → search → decipher → plan, with a quiet Charged Poise closure. Orientation is solid and the map reveal tightens options credibly. The ending’s cost is implied (volatile aura, social risk) rather than concretely paid on the page, softening the closure’s force. Still, the before/after stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: prophecy → concealed passage → mirror reconfiguration → central timepiece repair → identity shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she becomes “guardian of rhythms.” Causality is clean, though stakes never tightly pinch; cost is conceptual rather than felt. The pattern is taught early and paid off without teleports or logic gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: chalk messages → reexamination → discovery of the bell → unified ringing → orchard revival. Orientation is clear early and the lens reads Causal with a decisive on-page turn. The ghost’s off-stage procurement of nebula particles borders on convenience, softening cost. Closure lands as a Decisive Change but with a low felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: lighthouse duty → discovery/handling of the puppet head → visions through the “pane of hush” → lullaby → clock adjustment → vow in darkness. Orientation lands early and holds. Closure reads as a charged poise/earned stasis with conceptual cost—she buys gentler time and commits to a path that isolates her further. The causal chain is soft but coherent, with no late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal drive holds: find seed-core → infer blueprint → assemble no-touch pattern → birds redirect → travelers saved → self-repricing of role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she loosens her refusal and accepts the guardian’s stance). The time pressure and environment constrain tactics, avoiding coincidence. The meta-textual “word count” intrusions are a seam but don’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: environmental observations (foam, chrysalis) coherently lead to the decision to call. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure (placing the call) lands on the page with a conceptual cost. The causal chain is internal but legible: grief → pattern recognition → revaluation → action. Slight neatness in the final turns keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: counting voids → incisions → environmental response → hidden alcove forms a clean because/therefore pattern within a lyric design. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she releases the moonlight and discovers the pristine void with a felt conceptual cost (spent resource, exposed lack). Orientation is strong from the opening. Stakes tighten once meaningfully at the second/third incision without breaking the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: rain → tidal pools → contagion vision → dig → pavilion → orbs → absorption → dawn. Closure lands on the page with cost through the arduous subsumption and bodily chill. The “dream-logic” discovery skirts convenience but is thematically seeded and paid off. The arc fits a single-scene progression with one meaningful tightening in the pavilion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the opening and the throughline (revive clock → convene talk → provisional plan) holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town gains a new practice and Elara’s ritual is charged by the clock’s return. The cost is modest (risk of rejection), and obstacles soften quickly, keeping escalation low but coherent under an accumulative lens. The causal chain is intact, if a touch idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene accumulation tightens cleanly: mirror placement → interface activation → painful surge → new capability. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost, and the lens (accumulative/textural with causal throughline) holds. Setups (implant awry, mirror’s distortions) pay off without contrivance. Stakes are contained but coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean causal chain: doodle → journey → inversion → discovery → return. Closure lands with an on-page decisive change (she obtains the seeds) though the price is mostly implied risk. Structure stays within a single arc with one meaningful tightening at the inversion. Lens reads primarily causal with a touch of accumulative texture; it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: setup (hush and motivation), development (finding/aligning the insulator), payoff (first resonant tones changing the grove’s poise). Orientation is clean early; causality is modest but consistent (analyze → align → strum → resonance). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the grove shifts from silence to charged possibility. Cost is mostly conceptual (endurance, delicate risk) rather than dramatized loss, which keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clear, with a coherent clock (before moonrise) and an on-page RR: the covenant stirs and exile reframes as a board reset. Because/therefore linkages hold within a textural lens: reading pulses → mapping to incantations → aurora response. Cost is largely conceptual/psychic rather than dramatized loss, keeping it just shy of top-tier. Orientation is strong from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene clarity, clean orientation, and a causal progression from device to unlocking to repricing via the diary read coherently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: clasp open, vow made, fireworks punctuating the shift. The cost is emotional and thematic rather than situational, but it’s on the page. Escalation is modest yet sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds cleanly from acquisition to cultivation to the bloom’s assault. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes serenity as embrace under cost (tears, nausea). Orientation is clear and the tide-turn provides a crisp hinge. Minor tell at the end doesn’t blunt the on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Coherent causal chain: inversion → anchors → echoes → vortex → discovery. Orientation is clean and the single-scene progression holds, but the closure’s cost is soft—responsibility is implied rather than felt. The ending functions as a conceptual repricing more than a decisive change, which is valid but modest in impact. Setups generally pay off without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: measured data, mapped vectors, and discovered vortices build toward a conceptual closure (rethink design and training). Orientation is clean from the start; the causal thread (site geometry → wind tunnels → microburst) stays legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with slight cost in the talismanic patch and the town’s hush. The ending’s price is felt but understated, limiting higher-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural pressure builds through the bell sequence to the statue’s emergence, a resonant reconfiguration on the page. Orientation is crisp and the ritual logic holds; the “chisel’s first strike” moment serves as a viable clock. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than personal, softening the decisive turn. Still, the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: orientation is crisp, and beats cohere from markers → flute → weave → insight → altered return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes her method (yielding to melody) with felt cost tied to prior failure. Causal threads (markers manifesting inside the weave; the hush engaging the note) pay off set-ups without contrivance. The piece stays within one scene’s pressure with a purposeful vision sequence bridging middle and end.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: preparation → printing → backfire → realization, all in one continuous window with a clean final cadence shift. Orientation is early and stable, and the halo fragment’s role links beats coherently. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on-page cost (disorientation, a foreclosed path to tidy math). Tight focus avoids outline-y “and then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pendant’s hum intensifies the pattern and leads to the shepherd encounter, culminating in a decisive relinquishment with cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset (ridgeway under auroras; courier; pendant); the reflective beats are anchored to present stimuli. Closure lands on-page with the pendant transfer and reweighted mission. The causal chain is quiet but intact and proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: the prism-frost method → trance → “shifted hush” → repriced belief. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost (confronting estrangement, tears, renunciation of isolation). Orientation is clean and the lens holds. The brief meta tail (“Wait, that’s over…”) scuffs the landing but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → assembly → vision → sacrifice → release. Closure lands on-page with cost as she unweaves decades of work to power the bead. Orientation is clean from the outset and no causality breaks. The because/therefore chain is modest but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: arch decay → choice of deepest shaft → silk-anchored hammer-ritual → crystalline vines stabilize arches. The closure is on-page with a felt cost (frayed silk, prolonged vigil) and a clear before/after (planet stabilizes). Orientation is strong early, and the drive lens (causal with lyric accumulation) holds. Stakes resolve without deus ex machina or rule-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Hybrid with causal beats inside a lyric accumulation; closure is a conceptual repricing as she accepts the burden’s reality. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the shard-driven weaves escalate coherently. The cost appears on-page as a reframed rule (crossings add dangerous weight) with an emotional price, not just a statement. Slight telliness in the mentor’s “explanation” softens impact but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV, one-night arc with a clean accumulative/textural drive: arrival → eerie climb → discovery of the letter chain → vow → relighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias assumes guardianship—tethered to a concrete act (rebuilding the stack and lighting the lamp). Causality is coherent (each find prompts the next move), and the cost is conceptual/emotional. Escalation is quiet but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual → visions → steering → acceptance/extinguishing forms a coherent arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the final extinguishing after the “fading” vision reframes the routine with cost (obsolescence). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught and kept. The cost is present but remains mostly conceptual; no decisive narrowing beyond the chosen ritual slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the sun-trail ritual escalates perception toward a resonant reconfiguration at the edge. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR—the decision to embrace magnetized stories with acknowledged risk—cleanly anchored in on-page images. Cost is present but subtle; the storm risk is named rather than tested. Spatial-temporal orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and images build to a Conceptual Repricing where the sextant reveals the tower’s geometry and the trees’ witness. Orientation is clear early, and the pin’s echo delivers the tightening beat that leads to the balcony. Closure lands on the page, but the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt. Causality is lyrical but coherent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: songs accrue, window is prepared, dawn reweaves the world. Closure lands on-page via the humming window and blooming dawn (RR/CR hybrid), but the explicit cost is muted. The bracketed meta intrusions at the end slightly fracture cadence and dilute the final image. Still coherent single-scene structure with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Coherent causal chain: find → hide → choose “staying while leaving” → access door → place invitation → emerge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he carries a “quiet revolution”), but the cost is mostly conceptual; the guard/enforcer pressure never bites on the page. Orientation is clean and the accumulative cadence supports the end. The “price” remains implied, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: planting → offering → tea → reflection → charged poise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a provisional peace amid acknowledged erosion. The cost—fragility of absolution and the world’s forgetting—sits on the page. The throughline is coherent with one meaningful deepening rather than a causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causality is clean: illusions fade, she measures, adjusts, and stabilizes the vows. The closure lands on-page (the vows steady; the gauge harmonizes), though the price paid is light and largely procedural. Orientation is solid early, and the accumulative pressure is kept coherent through tools and metrics. The final turn is earned but soft on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain: three false starts ratchet toward a decisive act (snatching and dousing the flare), yielding a fragile stasis as patrol horns and chaos force a halt. Closure lands (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) with the captured “sound” and a dawn slip-away. The patrol horns feel partly coincidental, and the price paid is under-explicit, slightly dampening the decisive impact. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative drive is coherent: taste anomaly → ring stabilizes → climb to the bluff → carriers explain → inward-pointing compass = closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, but the on-page cost is faint. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the lens holds. Meta intrusions (“recalibrate,” word-count aside) blur the cadence but do not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: laughter fades → painting discovered → safe revealed → mnemonic code applied → sketchbook reclaimed → recommitment. Closure is a Decisive Change with a resonant reconfiguration; the cost is acknowledged on the page. The “convenient” pristine tools risk coincidence but are motif-coherent and don’t undercut the arc. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: discovery → assembly via the zinc plate → Kael’s pressure → descent → encounter with the Echo Vault. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; she emerges transformed with a plan to inscribe recovered candor. Cost is implied (risk, betrayal) rather than materially dramatized, keeping it just shy of top-tier. Orientation is solid from the opening and consistent through the tunnel sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens reads clean: wind rises, mechanism engages, listeners transform, dusk descends; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with lingering symphonies etched into memory. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). Cost is present but subtle (his muteness and the slow fade as the piece winds down). Causality is coherent within the lyric mode, with no broken setups.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative arc coheres: magnetic shift → rising static → relic box → controlled burn → escalation → cooling and re-alignment. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (pain, a preserved shard), and the farm’s stability mirrors the internal quieting. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. The because/therefore chain is clean even within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: locket → listening to stories → Tomas’s clue → locket opens → mailbox unlocked → letters spill. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant communal reconfiguration. Cost is largely emotional/social (apologies, tears), not structural, but it’s legible. Orientation is solid early and the hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone: dice → codes → dance → AI persuasion → interface → liberation. Orientation is immediate and stable; the single-scene arc holds cleanly. Closure is a decisive change (sister restored) with some cost implied (risk, alarms) but not intensely felt. No major causality breaks, though resistance resolves a bit easily.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain holds: whale → memory loss → chamber → coffee augury → dig → exhumed memento → flood of memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—memories stored in salt, retrieved at cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines. Slight convenience (one try divination instantly guiding to the correct node) trims the sense of struggle and price.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual tightens through “mapping silence,” culminating in the wing sealing the hush. Closure lands on the page, though the price is light. The late meta line (“Wait, error…710 words”) breaks immersion and dulls the cadence of the ending. Orientation is clean and single-scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: accumulation of weekly teas crescendos to the rooftop confrontation and transfer of the seal. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear RR closure when Elara “hears” the building. Causality holds (interrogation prompts revelation), though stakes tilt more conceptual than materially costly. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: preparation → progressive archiving passes → dawn closure. Closure lands on-page with the shell going silent and being set among roots, reconfiguring options and identity (RR with a touch of DC). Causality is clean, with the resonance method providing coherent linkage between attempts. The cost is present conceptually, though not heavily stressed in consequence terms.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: sanctuary → blooded thorn → traced key → relinquishment → exit. Closure lands as a decisive internal change with on-page cost; the drive lens remains textural/ritual and consistent. Setups (thorn, key, forger skill) pay off cleanly. Minor redundancy in late lines slightly blurs the cadence of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture via the shell’s staged revelations. Closure lands: she sings, webs fray, echoes (including her sister’s) are freed; the cost is her diminished voice and possible lingering echo. Orientation is clear early, and set-ups (shell, Weavers, ritual) pay off, though the meta intrusion (“[600-800…]”) breaks immersion briefly. Cost is present on-page but not maximally dramatized at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural structure is coherent: windows → cameos → pattern recognition → exposure → release. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with the snow globe’s single flake and warming shrine. Causal pressure is soft but consistent under the chosen lens, with no orientation debt. The cost is largely conceptual (repricing purity), keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: actions accrete (whisk → whistle → moon paths → net at river) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early and never slips. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—honoring hidden effort with ongoing cost implied as dawn disperses the fireflies. The on-page price is subtle rather than forcefully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causal flow is coherent: rumor → investigation → documents → inference → excavation → decision. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing and small decisive act (pocketing the fragment, intent to reveal), but on-page cost is light. The meta intrusions (“But wait… No, recount—actually…”) undercut the ending’s authority and cadence. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: storm → sharpened signals → shattering pane → embrace of prophet role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: dawn realized, portico fractured, vigilance resumed with a charged question about lingering shadows. Some turns (villages toppling, mass realignment) are off-page summaries, softening cost texture. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: jar by jar deepens and reweights the stake toward a resonant final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines), and the closure lands with a felt cost (tears, renunciation of mere survival for a purpose). The beat sequence is coherent without and-then drift. Cost is more emotional than consequential, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean and the causal chain is coherent: encroaching ice → key/emitter reveal → resonant ritual → stabilization. Closure lands on-page with the marina steadied and the artifact secured, a credible end-state for this scope. The cost is mostly exertion and tension, not a lasting price, keeping the turn modest. Still, the single-scene arc holds under a causal lens without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative cadence) holds: moon-tracking leads to timed crossing and seed-planting, culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands as a decisive crossing plus conceptual repricing (revolution as patience), with a felt price of restraint and risk on the slick viaduct. Orientation is crisp from the first lines. The cost remains modest (no direct Overlord pressure on-page), trimming peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV, single-scene structure is clean; the drive reads Hybrid (causal investigation catalyzed by a mystical object), and closure lands via a decisive stance shift. Orientation is strong early; the lantern discovery provides the central turn. The cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page. The causal bridge from vision to “contractor bribing the bureau” is asserted rather than earned through intermediate evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene structure is clean, causality coherent: repair attempts → mechanism stirs → light reframes → vow to act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a concrete next step (deliver the box), paid for by acknowledged regret. Orientation is crisp from the first sentences. Cost is emotional rather than materially constraining, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: salvage of the arrow, transliteration via kaleidoscope, integration, and bell-ringing form a clean because/therefore drift. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what) and remains legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the glider “alive with yearning”—but on-page cost is modest. The structure is cohesive but lacks a strong tightening turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: anomaly → lie for access → discovery → conceptual repricing → concealment. Orientation is clean early, and the corporate lockdown creates clear procedural pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a palpable, if subdued, cost. A sharper on-page consequence would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV, clear spatial anchors, and a coherent situational drive culminate in a de-escalation on the page. The shard’s “inexplicable pull” skirts convenience but is integrated before the intervention, and closure lands with a Decisive Change. Cost is present but muted, keeping the turn effective rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: the pattern builds from procedure → stories → recording → storm → guiding a family. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she finally “hears” endings as a gentle unfurling. Causality is soft but coherent, with the recording and storm meaningfully intensifying pressure. The price is felt conceptually; a slightly clearer concrete cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear orientation leads into a single, coherent night scene; the missed bus situates situational pressure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: dawn, the gifted sketch, and Elena’s lighter heart with the letter tucked away. Cost is conceptual but felt—she remains the sentinel, choosing endurance with recalibrated meaning. The lens holds (Situational), with coincidence (Liam’s arrival) complicating, not resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned ritual actions (clearings, parapet’s hum) build to a resonant rite that changes the pavilion’s state. Closure lands on-page—the echo is anchored and the pavilion’s timbre reweighted—though the cost is quiet rather than biting. Orientation is clean early and maintained. The causal chain is coherent within the poemic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece deepens through patterning (arcs, vines, lavender, photos) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—private archiving shifts to communal sharing—with a gentle cost implied. Orientation is clean and the one-scene flow is coherent. The cost is present but soft, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and maintained: whispers → crystal echoes → realization → shelving. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“the last dictionary’s end was…a seed”—with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise final image. Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is coherent within the lyric design. The cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting extremity but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: markers → circle → recorder → capture. Orientation is clean, and closure lands with a recorded hum plus a future-facing prophecy that reweights the journey. Cost is present (disorientation, effort, partial relief) though not crushing. The throughline is coherent without causal cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal spine: broken chronometer threatens launch window; quake tightens pressure; leaf insight leads to restructuring; launch succeeds; conceptual reweighting lands. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change plus a quiet CR). Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, keeping it just short of top-tier. Orientation is clear from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp, and the accumulative/textural drive coheres to a resonant reconfiguration: a goodbye that reunifies memory and family. The vinyl shard and scent motif loop back cleanly into the closing image. Cost is present in the felt farewell and relinquishment. The daughter’s “inner call” skirts convenience but functions within the chosen lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: discovery → activation → learning/closing loops → vision/repricing → aftermath. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (shadows as sanctuary/Null Vault), coherently tied to the established mechanisms. Costs remain mostly conceptual; no immediate consequence tests the new knowledge, tempering impact. The causal chain holds, with a satisfying internal logic around the orrery and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: find the tooth → choose the ritual → receive echoes, not the child → acceptance. The accumulative/textural drive holds, with the garden’s wards and the tooth’s runes cohering causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. A few abstract assertions in the final third temper the otherwise tight cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: discovery → weighing/polishing → public offering → resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she becomes a conduit of light for the village, reweighting her past vow. Orientation is strong from the outset (grotto, mist, sea), and causal links hold without soft resets. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized in crisis, but legible in the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: setting → icicle pattern insight → approach → proffer → shared silence → repriced pendant. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost (she risks re-wounding by offering the father’s relic). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the lens holds. The chain of attention and image creates a clean before/after without mechanical plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural design is taught early (cameo method) and sustained; the cameo sequence tightens toward “the final breath before his pages would seal shut forever.” Closure lands on-page: he vows, uses the shell as talisman, and completes the manuscript. The cost is the sealing of transience into permanence—credible but soft. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual sequence coheres toward a clear on-page reconfiguration (practices rekindled, land responds). Orientation is strong from the opening and the pattern is taught and kept. Closure lands but the felt price is soft, with success arriving without a meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The “alignment” clock provides structure but little narrowing beyond timing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual escalates (patterning → ignition → starlight → seal) to a resonant reconfiguration when the plate transforms and she carries the map within. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and stable; set-ups (starlight, plate, discarded items) pay off causally. The closure carries cost (vigil, cold, grief) and changes options—she now has a living map. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterative studies of angles lead to the breakthrough and a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why), and the artifact’s return ties causally to the closure image. The cost (locking away grief as echo) is conceptual and understated, softening impact. Escalation is steady rather than pressured, but the closure cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: successive calcifications build toward a charged dawn and the burner cooling, a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive break. Who/where/when are anchored early; the kerosene lamp’s method supplies causal coherence. Closure lands as a charged poise—release glimpsed, not granted—with the trap persisting as cost. Slightly soft pressure prevents a higher score, but the structural cadence is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a present-tense frame pressured by the kettle and interleaved memories culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (she returns to act, carving as containment). Orientation is clean from the first sentence (who/where/when anchored promptly). The cost is legible in the refusal to stay inside the crystals and the acceptance of grief’s persistence. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the boil-over delivers closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: debris-gathering → ghost confrontation → negotiation → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (accepting the lost wheel and choosing a new narrative). Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. Escalation is modest but coherent and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV, single-scene causal through-line: find object → infer use → attempt → lights revive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with the lights returning and the sextant reweighted in the final image. Cost is implied (lonely labor, limited power) rather than dramatized, which keeps the turn quiet but intact. Orientation is clear early; the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one scene, one dominant stake, and a clear Earned Stasis closure as he places the unfinished clock face and accepts integration over ambition. Causality is modest but coherent (rain/forecourt → whispers → choice), and the price is the relinquishment of a once-grand design. However, late meta-bracketed word-count intrusions fracture the closing cadence and partially dull the charged final image. Orientation is clean and the structure otherwise sound.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: trained instincts → dive → recovered chest → journals → repricing of his quest. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a clear before/after (“not a mystery to conquer, but a bridge he’d finally crossed”). Orientation is solid from the outset; the lens reads as predominantly causal with lyric accumulation. Stakes could tighten further with an obstacle that materially narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: patient decoding → resistance → loosening → vision → capture in glass. Orientation is crisp from the outset (Elias, dock, snow/fog), and the closure is on-page with a felt endurance cost. Causality is accumulative rather than turn-based, but the “warming rope/loosening knots” is a legible inflection. The ending reconfigures options (knowledge preserved) without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: observations → object-handling → act of writing → realization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts isolation as the cost of his method, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent. The cost is legible on the page (missed ship; chosen solitude) even if the inciting choice occurs off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the build from gathering to assembly to the egg’s reveal produces a conceptual repricing with cost (fragility vs. grind). Orientation is clear early (who/where/now), and the single-scene structure tightens coherently to a charged final image. The because/therefore is soft but legible: because he assembles, he discovers, therefore he vows. The closure lands on the page without mechanical overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: the ritual graft, the coin, and the encounter culminate in a charged final image. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the coin glinting, the wanderer’s softened scars, and Elara’s belief subtly “proven.” Cost is conceptual and emotional (using her father’s relic; addressing inherited harm), if quiet. The scene maintains one coherent window and fulfills a single dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: breadcrumbs → stained glass box fused by curse → night-long patience → press → release. Single POV and orientation are strong from the opening image; the accumulative pattern of clues holds to closure. The Decisive Change lands on-page with the box opening and the city stirring, and cost is legible via time and the cold night. Stakes remain coherent without late rule shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the journey’s sonar-mapped progression, the rift discovery, and the vision coalesce into a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis at closure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and the final act (sharing the gear) is causally motivated by the ongoing pattern and her stated aim. Cost is conceptual but on-page: accepting that light shared may not break the cycle. The cadence tightens at the nexus without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring returns at dusk, Liora’s guidance, and the migration rhythm cohere into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost: the decision to carve a collective gravestone and let Liora fade, reweighting grief from private to communal. Orientation is clean from the outset; setup pays off in the final image with the ribbon-bound dinner. The price is felt as acceptance and altered ritual rather than a conventional dramatic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear single-POV arc: pendulum pause → vision → rake inscriptions → decision to confess. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt price (public confession) and is charged by the persistent constraint of time and tide. The bob’s resumed swing crisply marks the before/after. The magical-seeming materialization of the rake handle is taught within the story’s internal logic and does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Structure is clean: find the case → reveal the tapestry fragment → decode → realization. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and closure is a conceptual repricing (intentions as fluid), but the on-page cost is minimal. Orientation is strong early, and the throughline remains legible. Meta intrusions (“But wait… Word count adjustment…”) slightly fracture the closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear single-scene arc: arrival → ascent → modeling → hesitation → charged poise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with an on-page before/after—she refuses premature inscription to finalize a plan at cost of delay and risk. The accumulative lens holds; causal links are inferential but coherent. The cost is felt, if more implied (council pressure, scarcity) than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-POV, accumulative drive holds: radio → instruction-in-song → dust activation → dissemination via altered scores. Orientation is immediate and coherent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Elias becomes a conduit and the halls respond. Cost remains mostly implied (censors, secrecy) rather than dramatized in the final beat, limiting the decisiveness. Still, the cadence lands and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the making sequence tightens toward the chair’s programmed stop and the mask’s placement. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing when motion ceases and the “mirage of safety” is reframed by stillness and ash. Cost is legible—accepting partial truth and enduring grief rather than chasing comfort. The arc is elegant, though the causal stakes remain quietly internal rather than pressured by external constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the accumulative structure (digging strata) coheres. The journal discovery tightens pressure and motivates the ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: a decisive refusal with visible conceptual cost, sealed by the wall-etching. The lens remains consistent without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the teaching arc progresses through patterned “subtraction” toward a charged final image. Orientation is clean, timeline legible, and the zither motif ties beats to closure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (quiet endurance) with a felt cost—he remains as the arts fade. The escalation is soft but coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors builds to a quiet closure: the seed is planted under the alignment, sprouts by dawn, and a community coalesces. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal beats threading through; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“this is enough”) with a charged final image. Cost is implied more than felt (risk versus corporate erasure), keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → Lira’s arrival → toll exchange → riddle → revelation → ascent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: knowledge shift reframes the crisis and Elias’s ethic of wonder, with a light but present cost (risking guarded secrets). Orientation is immediate and stable. Stakes resolve enough to feel earned without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene accumulative build: bay hush → entry → shard → ritual reordering → house “stirs” → curated final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: aliveness reframed as bonds sanctified through displaced objects. Causality is coherent; orientation is clean from the opening. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is clean: confession → visions → tool/key revealed → tactic chosen → execution → conceptual repricing. Orientation is established early and held; the dome’s weakness provides a concrete objective. Closure lands as a decisive act plus conceptual repricing, though the on-page cost is soft. The meta postscript about word count undermines the closing cadence and slightly dulls the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: ritual → recollection → mathematical modeling → placing the dice → rupture → reweighted final roll. Closure lands on-page via the rupture and the reconfiguration of the staircase’s logic (DC with CR overtones). The price is mostly conceptual (risk of eternal fall, shattering reality), not paid materially, trimming impact. Orientation is firm from the start; the hybrid causal/conceptual lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: moonlight → brushwork → daydream mosaics → incantatory completion → rooftop “hum” and observed response below. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: insomnia yields to peace after a charged act, with a faint external confirmation (the distant figure). Orientation is clear from the outset, and the pattern remains consistent. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (vigil, vulnerability), subtle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean: beekeeper’s absence → warming currents → ice thaw → lens use accelerates melt → salvage and revival. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the global drive stays causal through closure. Closure lands with cost on the page (corroded flecks, lost ice vault) and a decisive behavioral shift (practice over vitrines). Minor neatness in the final reprise keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal throughline is clean: reverse-engineer yoyo → decode stone → perform ritual at low tide → radiance erupts → cost lands when it fades and the yoyo is spent. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the tide clock provides a simple, legible escalation. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (“time bent, if only for one man”). Slight abstraction in the consequence for the wider world keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Hybrid lens with causal beats (advisor → dictionary → clasp → confession → manifestation) holds, but the closure is undercut by meta revisions (“Wait, that’s over—recalibrate...”). A Decisive Change occurs (fear dissolves), with some conceptual cost (admitting guilt), yet it’s partly summarized and self-edited mid-landing. Orientation is clean; however, the “mental photograph” rule-solve is a bit convenient at the end. The arc is legible but not flawlessly executed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: storm threat → cloud interpretation → fractal sketching → dubbing → transformed storm. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s music absorbs impact and the final image seals the stance. Cost is mostly situational risk rather than a concrete loss, but the pressure chain holds. Orientation is clean from the outset, and no causality breaks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative to a CR/RR closure—sonic query → wave-glyph reply → conceptual reweighting (Thorne now a watcher; breach caused the rusting). Orientation lands early, and causality holds (whistle prompts turtle shift and watchers’ response). The cost is legible on the page (grief plus renewed burden). Minor expository density does not blunt the clean on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV, single-scene structure is clean and oriented early; the accumulative lens holds. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he accepts the cost of stripping the myth, crystallized in the petal/ivy/letter reprise. Causal flow (letter → analysis → resolution) is intact if quiet. Stakes deepen once, not twice; still sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: work → discovery → ritualized repair culminates in a quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as his role redefines from surveyor to “archaeologist of abandoned dreams,” but the cost is soft. The bracketed meta interruptions near the end dent cadence and slightly blur the final beat’s authority. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal flow is clean: discovery of the stamp → hypothesis → test → conceptual repricing about Thalassara’s fall. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens reads Hybrid leaning Accumulative with causal beats. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting with a forward-facing decision. The cost is more inferred than felt, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the shadow’s departure catalyzes a ritual sequence that crescendos with the first crane animating and the island’s paradoxical motion, resolving in a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (earned stasis): grief persists but is transformed into flight. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame, with consistent world rules. The cost is legible in his relinquishment of recorded dreams and acceptance of a peace that is not erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: probe → crystal awakening → realization of pooled energy → coordinates → initiated attack. The “breakers cooling” clock and reboot mark a coherent single-scene arc with a Charged Poise/incipient Decisive Change at the end. Cost is conceptually legible (joy curdled into weaponry; self-recognition as hunter), though not materially paid on the page. Orientation is solid from the opening; lens reads Hybrid with a causal dominant at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: tool engagement → decoding → convergence → etching. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with the final etching that “binds” her to the cosmos. The because/therefore chain is coherent though largely procedural; the felt price at the end is conceptual rather than dramatic, so cost lands lightly. Still, the cadence shift at “final pull” provides a clean on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation lands early (terrace → shore at dusk), and the piece follows a tight two-shard accumulative structure. Closure is a resonant decision—he will tell Eliza—with conceptual cost legible in the final talisman image. The causal chain is more textural than event-driven, but the watch-hand discovery functions as a hinge. Stakes are resolved in Charged Poise; a direct scene with Eliza would have heightened cost but isn’t required.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causality is clear: prior botch → apology → tightly timed exchange under moon protocol → handoff with a symbolic cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias trades a high-value spy and relinquishes the talisman, earning tentative peace and a reframed self. Cost is on-page (loss of leverage/intel; surrender of the heirloom), and the lens holds situationally. Orientation is anchored early with parapet, moon phase, and roles.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive reads as mostly causal with situational pressure: compass fails → adapts to poles → reaches beach. Closure is weakened by meta intrusions (“word count check,” bracketed “Final: 685”) and an off-stage reconciliation summarized rather than enacted, reducing felt cost at the end. Orientation is solid early, but the late self-referential asides fracture the scene’s integrity. The coincidence of Lena’s presence does not feel earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure coheres: clinic exit → research via newspapers → tunnel journey → labyrinth fork → vision-induced reweighting → surfaced resolution. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (he emerges changed) and on-page cost (enduring the victims’ pain). The brief meta-glitch in the final lines wobbles cadence but doesn’t break closure. Causality is intact for this length; the baseball tracks as a throughline object.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: grief → orchard → fortune → spices → metamorphosis → conjuration → reunion. The closure lands on the page with a decisive change and felt cost, and the lens remains causal with lyric texture. The fortune risks convenience, but prior lore and carried spices ground motivation. Orientation is early and stable; the single-scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: ritual steps causally gather meaning toward a resonant reconfiguration (the saucer “mends” in essence; she resolves to return). Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when nailed early). Cost is legible in the relinquishment of defiance and acceptance of responsibility/time-loss. A single deepening turn (cards/“lost time gathers here”) substitutes well for plot reversals, if a touch explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ritual steps deepen until the final stitch opens the dimension. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early, and set-ups (photos’ tears, Kwan Yin’s tear, stitching) pay off. Closure lands on-page with the portal opening and release of ghosts. The cost is primarily the endured confrontation, not a trade-off, but it functions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV, one-scene arc coheres under an accumulative/textural lens, landing a conceptual repricing: transformation as a quiet alignment rather than rupture. Because/therefore is soft (coincidence and prophecy do heavy lifting), but the detour → release → communal/volcanic response links. Closure is on-page with cost implied (he remains destitute; gives away the “bottled stars”), and the final image reweights the premise. A touch of externalized fate slightly dilutes personal causal weight but doesn’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain holds: blackout → sundial cipher → gathering → descent → cradle activation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the revolution’s inception is on-page via the collective “wink,” but the cost is mostly implied, not felt. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern stays coherent. Lack of a concrete obstacle or sacrifice at the climax keeps the payoff modest.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative structure is clean: preparation → activation → revelation → step. The closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act, but the emotional/physical cost at the edge is implied more than pressed. Causal scaffolding (aurora energizes dust; eels amplify) holds without contradictions. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (timer, storm, concealment) and pays off when the bell triggers his decisive move. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single-scene window holds. Closure lands as a charged poise/decisive turn: he leaves safety to deliver censored work, reconfiguring options under risk. Cost is felt conceptually and situationally, if not dramatized with external resistance on the stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene structure with clear anchors and a coherent drive: decode → weigh overture → choose verbal fencing at arrival. Closure lands as a stance shift (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): greet as ally, not foe, with the needle card extended. Causality is tidy—sundial cipher prompts a new option—but the price of accepting the overture is only implied. The lens holds (situational with accumulative texture), though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: moonlit sorting → plan → smuggling → communal readings → guard light testing their creation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library now exists as a charged haven; the guard’s beam provides on-page pressure with implied cost. Causality is coherent (tin enables smuggling; friendship enables labor), though the climax is quiet. Stakes are felt if not overtly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Patterned accumulative structure coheres: clock drop → discovery of reel → compass reveal → performance → charged closing image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the clock whirs, compasses lock, and his options reweight toward action over stasis. Causality is intact with motivated ellipses; the arbor-as-nexus rule is taught by the film and paid off in projection. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially constraining, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the accumulative drive coheres: planting → dream interpretation → communal ritual at dawn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a new shoot, memories surfacing, with the monsoon approaching and a felt unresolved cost. Causality is intact and escalates without soft resets. Stakes are tested in scene rather than merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative with soft causal steps (compass → lace → instructions → ritual → color → apology). Orientation is clean from the outset and the single-scene arc coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the color reveals, he speaks the apology, and the compass points home, with emotional cost legible. No major causal seams or unkept setups.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, where the build-up of observations leads to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure lands cleanly with a felt emotional cost ("Tears welled"). The primary structural success is how Elara's internal journey is externalized through a methodical, scientific process. The causal link between butterfly dust and neutron star magnetic fields requires some suspension of disbelief, but it serves the story's potent metaphor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain from survival to discovery to resolve. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands cleanly with a felt cost—the destruction of her previous life and illusions of isolation. The use of the frost patterns as a key discovery is a well-motivated turn that connects the character's past skills to her present crisis, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure. The orientation is immediate, the single scene is well-contained, and the progression from arrival to discovery to climax is logical. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands decisively on the page with a clear felt cost—the confrontation with visualized trauma—and establishes a new, hopeful status quo for the protagonist and the community.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear, felt cost. The causality is strong, except for the introduction of the "impossible spaces," which feels slightly convenient. Mentioned as a tale he'd heard just before he needs it, this mechanism functions as a near deus ex machina, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The narrative builds pressure through atmospheric detail and observation, leading to a powerful climax. The closure is an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the community's stance is decisively altered with a clear, felt cost—the heightened risk of their new, open alliance. The before/after state is perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a dense, dreamlike atmosphere that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. The closure unit is clear: the understanding of love's storage shifts from a physical quest to an internal state, healing the wound and the relationship. The cost is the act of surrender and shared vulnerability, which is felt on the page. The structure is a tight, single scene that escalates cleanly from discovery to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, moving from seeking to discovery, entrapment, and a decisive escape. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is held perfectly, with pressure building through intensification rather than pure causality. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, earned through a Decisive Change (disintegrating the fragment), with a clear and felt cost—the traumatic experience—leaving Elias in a permanently altered state.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from discovery to confrontation to resolution without any breaks in logic. The closure is a strong Decisive Change, with Elias physically breaking his chains and beginning his mission, providing a resonant "after" state with a clear, felt cost. The plot adheres perfectly to the single-POV, two-shard structure, with the transition from the carnival to the field marking a clear progression of the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively toward the forging. The intended closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, transforming the "sound of breaking" into a "healing hum" with a clear felt cost. The causal logic holds perfectly within its own established rules, with the final image providing a resonant before/after state change.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere toward a valid Conceptual Repricing at the close. The plot structure is sound and the orientation is clear. However, the progression relies on a series of convenient discoveries—the abandoned portrait, the specific flower code, the jar of moonbeams—which slightly softens the causal tension, reading more as a fable than a conflict overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story exhibits masterful structural control under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot progresses through a series of resonant discoveries that build pressure toward a decisive, costly final action. The closure, a clear Decisive Change, is perfectly set up by the preceding beats and lands with significant weight, making the before/after state change undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, from discovery to confrontation. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear cost. The primary weakness is the climax's reliance on a slightly implausible gadget: the seashell half rigged years ago with a hidden speaker "in paranoia." This convenience verges on a late-breaking rule change, softening the otherwise earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a single, continuous scene that deepens in intensity toward a clear closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The cost—the final star winking out, leaving her with a fragile mental map against true oblivion—is both tangible and conceptually potent. The narrative arc from anxious observation to sated beginning is seamless, with the ending providing a perfect, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with excellent structural integrity for its length. The single scene is well-anchored, and the narrative progresses logically from inciting incident to a powerful closure. The ending achieves a clear Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's purpose is reweighted with a tangible conceptual cost, landing with precision and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal lens from inciting incident (finding the lens) to a decisive change (offering connection). The closure, where Elias joins the silent communion, lands with a clear emotional cost—vulnerability—and resolves his initial state of isolation. The structure is efficient and powerful for its length, with every beat contributing to the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean, building from ritual to revelation, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing that validates Elias's worldview—lands with resonant cost. The primary flaw is the convenience of the Luckometer spiking to 92.7 immediately before the discovery. This coincidence, while enabling the final beat, slightly undermines the core theme by having the technology accurately predict the "miracle," making the plot feel guided rather than purely earned through faith and action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from inciting incident to resolution. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, landing cleanly on the page ("proving time's sideways motion in irrefutable patterns") with the final image providing a resonant conceptual cost—the shattering of a linear paradigm. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure, where each beat logically propels the next, from discovery to decision to consequence. The closure, a Decisive Change (program destroyed) paired with a Conceptual Repricing (mystery solved into tragic resolution), lands with a perfectly legible cost. The inferred Causal drive lens holds without any deviation, creating a tight and resonant narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara’s stance (Charged Poise crystallizing into a decision), lands with a clear felt cost. The drive lens holds perfectly, and the impending cataclysm acts as a persistent constraint that shapes the final image, making this an exceptional example of short-form narrative architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear, effective accumulative structure that culminates in a causal turn. The orientation is excellent, and the progression into the tunnel mirrors the psychological descent. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the events are re-contextualized with a legible, felt cost ("the truth's heavy measure"), fully satisfying the rubric's requirements for a high-impact ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building from a state of decay to one of permanence. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands with resonant clarity, making the before/after state perfectly legible. The origami swan serves as a functional, if convenient, causal link between the two states, and the felt cost of the journey and the abandonment of the library is effectively implied.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere and recurring imagery toward a powerful climax. The structure is clean, orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Theo's wonder is rekindled—lands with earned emotional weight. The cost is the shared vulnerability required to re-engage with grief, made tangible by the transfer of the keepsake, which perfectly satisfies the requirements for a high-quality closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building from a clear initial state to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, Elowen's reframing of her quest "not to restore the world, but to dream anew," lands with a palpable conceptual cost—the acceptance of finality. The structure is a masterclass in economy for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Situational) lens. The plot progresses from a clear decision to an on-page complication and lands on a potent Charged Poise (RR) closure. The final image of the lighthouse beam illuminating unseen paths, with Elias and Maris sharing a secret destiny, reconfigures the stakes with a palpable sense of earned potential, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly, building pressure through layered action rather than linear causality. The structure is a clean, single, continuous scene that moves from inciting incident to a decisive climax. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where the priest succeeds but must remain eternally vigilant, lands with a clear, felt cost ("the weight of guardianship settling"), fulfilling the requirements for a high score but is capped due to prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of a causal chain, it builds atmospheric and emotional density towards a powerful climax. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise: Elias stands ready, his internal state reconfigured, with the cost of his struggle against exhaustion palpable. All structural elements serve this final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating as a single, continuous scene with a clear threshold crossing. The Causal drive lens is held perfectly: every action proceeds logically from the last, culminating in a Decisive Change (fractured to whole) with a legible on-page cost during the confrontation with the shadow-self. The final realization that the labyrinth is self-created provides a powerful and earned turn that precipitates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere that makes the climax feel inevitable. The closure is a clean and powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, with the cost of her emotional breakthrough made visible on the page ("Tears came"), satisfying the demands of a complete narrative arc within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's causal structure is exceptionally tight, with each beat logically compelling the next. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the character's future options and stakes with a clearly felt cost—the loss of his peaceful solitude—all achieved within a single, continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a single, continuous scene with excellent structural integrity. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is perfectly suited to the material, building pressure through sensory detail toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the close. The ending lands with a clear and deeply felt cost—the full, unsuppressed pain of grief—making the before/after state entirely legible. This is a model of how to structure a short, introspective piece for maximum emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative structure until the very end, where it completely collapses into authorial meta-commentary. The multiple, contradictory endings ("...his ethically playful grin...", "...the tale ends as he lets the rope fall...", plus bracketed notes about word count) represent a catastrophic failure of structural integrity. While the intended closure ("lets the rope fall") would have been a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the on-page text is a chaotic draft, not a finished story.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure toward a resonant conclusion. The structure is a clean, single, continuous scene with clear orientation. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the "chronic hush" is not defeated but re-contextualized and softened. The felt cost—the permanence of the world's ruin and their personal losses—is legible throughout, making the final image of endurance earned and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a single-scene, accumulative structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The plot progresses not through external events but through an intensifying internal process, which is a perfect fit for the Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a clean Decisive Change—her transformation from detached dealer to empathetic healer—with a legible cost: the forfeiture of her protective emotional distance. The structure is simple, elegant, and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a single continuous scene, but its causal structure is critically weak. The resolution hinges on a series of coincidences—the envelope falling, containing a locket, and being intended for the ideal person standing nearby. The rubric states coincidence may complicate but not resolve, a rule this plot violates. The closure, a new partnership, is a Decisive Change, but it lacks any discernible on-page cost, reading as a purely positive outcome that wasn't earned through overcoming obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through shared experience rather than a causal chain. The closure unit is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's status is decisively changed, and the cost is legible in the lingering "beautiful sorrow" for what remains lost. The plot is elegant, coherent, and lands with earned emotional weight, satisfying the 9+ gate for on-page closure with cost under a consistent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The structure is exemplary for this length, following a clear causal chain from setup to consequence. The story establishes its unique rules (giant's nap, borrowed time) and adheres to them. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Elara achieves her goal at the cost of being permanently integrated into the timeless system she sought to document. This cost is legible and directly tied to the central conflict, making the ending both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a consistent Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the protagonist's understanding of her grief is fundamentally reweighted, landing with a clear, felt emotional cost that makes the before/after state legible. The causal logic of the magic ritual is internally consistent and leads directly to this resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, where the build-up of sensory detail and memory leads to an on-page closure. The final scene, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands with a clear felt cost as Elias sacrifices his hidden world for connection. The causal logic is internal and emotional, perfectly suited to the story's aims, and the persistent constraint of his hidden life shapes the final, liberating choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens, moving from inciting incident to a decisive climax. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (DC), with the cost—the loss of her purely human form—legibly paid on the page ("releasing the tight hold she kept on her human form"). The plot is contained and focused, perfectly suited to the story's length, with no structural faults.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is a clean and effective two-shard design operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Situational) lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure within a single continuous scene, culminating in a Decisive Change with a clear and heavy cost (loss of self). The plot is well-paced and builds effectively toward the climax. The primary flaw is a slight weakness in causality when the forces' motivation "twists" abruptly; this crucial turn is asserted through narration rather than dramatized, momentarily softening the otherwise strong because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is clear, and the two-shard structure works for this length. The closure lands on the page ("tentative laughter"), showing a clear emotional "after" state. The main weakness is the soft causality; the pivotal vision feels convenient rather than earned through struggle, but this is less damaging under the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens, moving from clue to discovery to action with logical consistency within its magical-realist framework. The structure is tight and culminates in a clear Decisive Change (boarding the train) that serves as a strong point of closure for this story-shard. The implied cost of stepping into the unknown is felt, making the ending resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating as a single, continuous scene with a powerful Accumulative/Textural drive.

    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The two-shard structure is clean, moving from flight to focused creation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is earned and powerful; Elias's realization that his notepad is a "map to reclaim the world" provides a conceptual turn that motivates the final, decisive action of descending, landing with a palpable sense of charged possibility and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure, governed by the rhythm of the tides, teaches its mosaic pattern early and uses it to build thematic density. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's void-like state is reweighted as a textured, whole existence, with the felt cost of abandoning a singular identity for a composite one. This change lands perfectly in the final paragraph, fulfilling the narrative's promise.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through a series of internal revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain, moving from inciting incident (taking the chip) to a strong Decisive Change (the vote to incorporate). The compressed timeline works well for this length, and the closure lands with a legible cost—the taming of their "wild heart" for survival. The structure is clean, and the plot fulfills its premise without deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The plot is elegantly structured, building to the capture of the "dawning hush" as a climax, perfectly aligned with the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is strong. The closure, where Elara captures the image and receives the nightwatch's spectral message to "preserve the precious," delivers a resonant reconfiguration with felt emotional cost, solidifying her purpose and ending her vigil. This earned stance makes the ending powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is structured effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building from setting and mystery to a moment of brilliant insight. The final beat achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the stakes of the journey are crystallized with a palpable cost. The central discovery relies on a convenient coincidence—the condensation pattern—but it functions as earned insight within the story’s mythic, solitary logic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds from a single hum to a collective rhythm, culminating in a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the town is "complete in spirit."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a tight, effective causal structure on a single continuous scene. The setup, inciting incident (opening the vial), complication (the kelp trap), and climax (the escape) are linked with strong because/therefore logic. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where she possesses the artifact and awaits rescue, lands cleanly with the felt cost of her near-death experience, satisfying the requirements for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with masterful control. The structure is simple but powerful, moving from the external setting to an internal sanctum and back out. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias puts his father's ghosts to "repose." The cost—the emotional weight he's carried his whole life—is made palpable, and its lifting provides a clear, earned 'after' state. Causality is psychological and symbolic, and it holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective structure with a strong causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative to Causal) lens. The inciting incident is clean, the escalation is steady, and the closure is a Decisive Change with a visible, on-page cost ("his body fading").

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story employs an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, where events and images build toward a resonant conclusion. The structure is clear, and orientation is handled well. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a legible cost—the time and labor of the excavation. The tremor serves its thematic purpose as an interruption, but feels slightly convenient and doesn't fundamentally alter her options beyond reinforcing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building toward a potent final moment of Charged Poise. The closure, where Elias turns to the post chute with his purpose crystallized, creates a clear "before and after" in his internal state. The implied cost of his transient, risky work is felt, making the ending resonant and earned without a decisive physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain from Elara's motivation to her final decision is strong and logical, with each discovery building towards the next. The closure unit—her decision to deliver the evidence—is a clear decisive change, earned by her investigative process. The inferred causal lens holds consistently throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual rather than causal turns. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with satisfying emotional cost on the page ("tears mixed with the mist").

The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and thematic weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end where the artist is renewed. The internal logic of the daydream, while fantastical, is consistent and leads directly to the earned closure, with the cost being the prior state of creative despair which is now overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly within a single, continuous scene. The structure builds pressure not through escalating events but through the layering of sound and sensation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elias, is earned on the page, with the cost being his "rigid certainty." The "pause between question and reply" is a brilliant structural choice that frames the climax, making the textural escalation feel both magical and causally sound within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is exceptionally tight for its length, following a clear causal chain from setup to resolution. The story establishes who, where, and when immediately and escalates pressure logically with the drone's approach. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias succeeds, solidifying his defiance, but the distant sirens confirm the cost of this victory is continued, heightened risk. The final image powerfully crystallizes the new status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a powerful intensification of imagery and emotion, leading to a resonant closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara finds a fragile peace, lands with a clearly legible conceptual cost, making the transformation feel earned and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot serves to deepen an emotional state rather than to change external circumstances. The closure is a superb example of Earned Stasis: a small victory that deepens the protagonist's core struggle, landing with a palpable emotional cost ("the foxglove regret deepened") that reconfigures her ongoing vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain within a single scene, and the closure is a Decisive Change. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost. The stated peril of "unraveling truths too potent to contain" never materializes, and the magical reconciliation is portrayed as a painless catharsis. The plot relies on a magical solution that bypasses the core conflict rather than forcing the characters to navigate it with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear one-scene structure, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure. The central causal mechanism—analyzing adhesive with a portable spectrometer to reveal an ancient encrypted text—is a significant flaw, straining credibility and functioning as a convenient deus ex machina. This convenience undermines the otherwise sound structure by providing a frictionless solution to the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The progression from internal ritual to external connection is logical and satisfying. The structure is slightly weakened by the summary-like transition "But doubts withered quickly," which tells rather than dramatizes a key moment of internal struggle, briefly flattening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and concept that pays off in a Causal final action. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing leading to a Decisive Change, is on the page and earned by the preceding discovery. The initial disorientation is stylistic and functional, clarifying into a coherent scene. The cost of her journey is felt in the long separation, and the mending of the world provides a satisfying, if gentle, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively until the end. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but it feels unearned, relying on a late-breaking magical element ("feather's magic") without prior setup or a legible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic layers toward a well-earned Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is tight, with a single continuous scene that allows the central question to deepen logically. Closure lands cleanly, with the final image re-framing the protagonist's understanding of loss at a legible, felt cost ("smiled through tears").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Causal lens, with a clear setup, escalation, and a Decisive Change at closure as the crowd's apathy transforms into enchantment. The structure is sound and well-oriented. However, the plot lacks meaningful opposition or complication, unfolding as a linear demonstration rather than a narrative with rising tension, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively toward the climax. The closure is an excellent example of a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's successful ritual transforms her elective exile into a moment of liberation and defiance. The cost—physical pain and the infusion of her soul—is legible on the page, making the final image of the fledged verse both earned and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is exemplary for its length and chosen mode. Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story uses a single, continuous scene to build toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the mundane is revalued against an impending shift. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the closure, while internal, lands with a legible felt cost—the poignant awareness of fragile, fleeting beauty. The execution is nearly flawless for this narrative type.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds from quiet observation to deep reflection, using the arrival of Lena as a perfect catalyst for the climax. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing, landing on Lena's new understanding ("a gift, not a curse"), with the cost—Elias's entire history of bargained innocence—made legible on the page. Orientation is immediate and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. Orientation is immediate and clear. The plot progresses through a symbolic ritual, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding of hope is fundamentally reweighted. The cost is the immense grief that forms the bedrock of the story, making the final triumph feel earned within its poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure that is highly effective for its length. The progression from seeking echoes to discovering a tangible archive provides a strong narrative engine. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the "burden" of legacy is reconfigured into a "map" for atonement, landing with a clear, felt cost ("heavier than the ivy outside").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of the heartbeat ("borrowed no more, pulsing freely") provides a powerful conceptual repricing of the central stake. This shift is earned, occurs on-page, and carries a clear, felt cost, representing an exemplary use of a quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, following a clean causal chain within a single, continuous scene. Orientation is established immediately, and the plot progresses logically to a strong closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the fragile peace is achieved at a clear personal cost to the protagonist. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly from setup to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless for a short story, operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds atmospheric and psychological pressure toward a Causal closure. The closure unit—shattering the egg—is a powerful Conceptual Repricing of his relationship with nature, landing with the felt cost of destroying a priceless relic. The final image of rain washing away the evidence provides a clean, resonant cadence, making the act's significance entirely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The single, continuous scene builds pressure toward a resonant "Charged Poise" closure, where the cost of defiance—the "inevitable pursuit"—is made palpable on the page. The final image powerfully reconfigures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure leading to a clear Decisive Change at the end, satisfying the basic requirements. However, the causality of the change feels thin, resting on epiphanies that arrive without sufficient struggle. The cost of renouncing his past and his collaborator is acknowledged but not deeply felt, as the ending emphasizes "clarity" and "serenity," thus muting the dramatic price of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building atmospheric density toward a resonant closure. The ending is a powerful instance of Charged Poise, where the interrupted ritual crystallizes the story's core concept without needing a decisive action. The cost is felt in the final, unresolved image, which is perfectly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain of events within a single, continuous scene, which is highly effective for this length. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's internal state, is achieved on the page as a direct result of her actions. The cost—the years of guilt now absolved—is felt, providing a satisfying and earned conclusion under a clear Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story executes a clean two-shard structure (waking/dreaming) leading to a definitive Conceptual Repricing at closure. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, as pressure builds atmospherically towards the internal shift. The dream-figure functions as a causal shortcut for the revelation, which is a minor weakness in an otherwise solid structure where cost is clearly felt in the final stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure. The ending is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias's state is "forever altered," sealing a covenant with a felt, fateful cost. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for its length and mode, with a final image that makes the internal change legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Causal lens. However, the closure—a Decisive Change—suffers from a significant lack of felt cost. The central causal mechanism, "cellular memory," functions as a convenient plot device that bypasses earned struggle, and Thorne's release feels painless. The "cost proof test" for the ending is not met, weakening the entire structure's foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where atmosphere and internal state build toward a clear closure. The ending is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elias integrates the dream, with the felt cost of his past failure and longing now reconciled. The before/after state is legible, and the internal causality holds perfectly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of vows is re-evaluated with a clear, felt cost as Elias offers the ribbon to the orchard. All structural components required for this length and lens are present and work seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure for its length: discovery, investigation, revelation, and decision. The closure is a strong Charged Poise, where Elara’s decisive change to pursue the inheritance forecloses her old life with the felt cost of future "disquiet." The plot adheres to its own logic without contrivance, and the single transition between the orchard and the pod is seamless. A very solid narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain from problem to resolution, successfully passing the orientation test. The primary weakness lies in the closure; the Decisive Change of gaining access to the library feels unearned because the cost is negligible. The final sentence summarizes the story's true goal—the rescues—rather than dramatizing a climactic moment, which deflates the narrative's conclusion into a mere statement of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the narrative progresses through a deepening of psychological pressure rather than external events. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, a resonant reconfiguration where Elara accepts her illusory freedom and commits to her path, with the cost of potential self-annihilation made palpable in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is tightly structured with a clear causal chain, smoothly progressing from anomaly to resolution. Closure lands decisively on the page with tangible effort and conceptual cost, and the narrative's causal lens remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain from goal to climax to resolution. The closure, an Earned Stasis, lands cleanly on the page. The primary weakness is the resolution's final beat: the energy beings "withdrew their intensity" merely by "sensing the shift." This feels slightly convenient, softening the impact of Elara's victory by making the antagonistic force passive in its own defeat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens, from the inciting vision to the earned resolution. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the beacon is lit) that lands with a Conceptual Repricing of "coincidence," and the cost is clearly legible in Elara's sustained struggle. The structure is elegant and efficient, with a persistent constraint—the broken prism—shaping every tactic until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the length. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s identity crystallizes with the felt cost of her solitary vigil, landing with quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail toward a decisive final action. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure unit—the successful firework display forming the word "Rise"—provides a powerful Decisive Change for Elias's internal state, landing on the page with a clear, felt cost (the expenditure of his creative energy against despair) and a visible triumph. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the "heavy pause." The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elara's vision and subsequent statement reframe the stakes for Thorne with a clear felt cost, visible in his easing tension. The single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the story's length and focus, with all elements converging on the pivotal moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, using the hour of inverted gravity as a perfect container. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s harvested silence is re-contextualized as a "counterweight" against her father's world, landing with a clear, felt cost as gravity and confinement return.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira finds comfort, is earned and lands quietly on the page. The cost is her preceding grief, which is recontextualized by the journey's solace, making the before/after state legible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal plot structure that is highly effective for its length. The orientation is immediate and clear, and the progression from the city to the orchard to the throne is logical and builds momentum. The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise, landing on a decisive action with a felt cost (the dissolving talisman) that reconfigures the future, leaving the stakes resonating. The structure is nearly flawless, marred only by the authorial intrusions which are penalized primarily in Voice (Q6) but slightly disrupt the narrative container here.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure that culminates in a decisive ritual. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration that affirms Elara's purpose, lands with a clear conceptual cost ("bridges burned"). The magical mechanism ("linking through scars") is introduced somewhat conveniently for the climax, which is the only element preventing a 9+ score, but it functions within the story's self-contained logic.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The inciting incident (glitchy messages) leads directly to the climax, and the closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the story's central metaphor becomes literal. The cost—embracing vulnerability and trusting the unknown—is felt in her decisive action, fully satisfying the requirements for publishable work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure with a strong closure unit (a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing). However, the central causal link is weak and relies on a mystical convenience. The leap from winding a gramophone to receiving specific, actionable intuition ("intuition bridged the gap to his grandmother's hidden diary") feels unearned, weakening the plot's integrity by resolving the core mystery through a mechanism that is asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmospheric decay until a decisive change. The closure unit is a strong Decisive Change, with the "breastplate agape" providing a clear image of the cost—the shedding of protective isolation. The plot is simple, focused, and lands its conclusion with narrative force.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a clean and effective Resonant Reconfiguration, as Eliza’s decision to transcribe the file provides a legible "before/after" shift in her stance toward her grief. The cost—the letting go of static mourning—is felt in the quiet, forward-looking nature of her final resolve, satisfying the rubric's highest standards for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean, linear structure with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a climax that delivers a valid Charged Poise closure. The primary weakness is causality; Kael's miraculous return feels like a convenient coincidence that resolves Elara's isolation, rather than an earned outcome of her choices. The puddle-map, while imaginative, also verges on a deus ex machina that solves a complex problem with magical ease.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where dread is replaced by serene peace, lands with palpable, on-page cost (the lifting of a generational burden). The internal logic of countering a coded prophecy with musical "negative space" is established and paid off, resulting in a deeply satisfying and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and significance toward a clear closure. The ending is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the image of the illuminated monuments crystallizes Elara's new role. The cost—the shedding of her purely orderly self for a new, integrated identity—is legible and earned by the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean Situational drive lens, where accumulating coincidences logically compel the protagonist toward a single point of decision. The structure is flawless for its length, moving from setup to a clear climax and resolution. Closure is achieved on the page as a Decisive Change—Elias secures the compass and a new worldview—with a felt cost represented by the immediate physical danger of the collapsing cavern, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene, building pressure through a ritual that deepens the protagonist's understanding. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Elarion's state from despair to purposeful resolve with a felt emotional cost. The structure is sound and the ending lands cleanly, but the causality of the final epiphany is weakened by the convenient arrival of Lirra's disembodied voice providing the answer ("Names weigh because they remember"), making the resolution feel slightly less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and musical intensification. The structure is a single, continuous scene with clear orientation. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, as Thorne finds peace and the gorge's atmosphere shifts, with the cost legible in Elara's own "aching luminously" heart. The final image provides a perfect cadence for this structure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory details and memory fragments that coalesce into a final shift in purpose. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands perfectly; Elias doesn't find his answer but solidifies his quest, accepting the cost of his exile. This structural choice feels earned, providing resolution of stance rather than plot, which is highly effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, effectively building atmosphere and layering memory to charge the final moment. The structure is a clean, single scene that successfully integrates reflection. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara completes her father's work, recontextualizing her grief into a shared purpose, with the cost being the years spent in longing and uncertainty, now resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=1.8)
    The story's structure collapses due to severe authorial intrusions that break causality. The lines "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" and "No, recount properly. Actually, the ledgers showed embezzlement..." are not narrative choices but raw drafting artifacts. This explicit, on-page rewriting of the plot’s climax shatters the fictional dream and constitutes a catastrophic structural failure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an impeccable Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot builds through a coherent sequence of discovery and intensification, moving from frost patterns to the final rupture with flawless logic within its fantastical rules. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into "Earned Stasis," is executed perfectly, with the cost—the destruction of the old perfection—made tangible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a compelling premise and executes a clear Conceptual Repricing for its closure, with the cost of truth-for-unity being legible. The primary weakness lies in causality; the resolution of a deep, factional "archaeological dispute" via a single poetic ceremony feels unearned and overly simplistic. The narrative skips the difficult work of persuasion, creating a causal gap that undermines the otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a flawless causal lens within a single, continuous scene, which is ideal for this length. The structure is tight, with a clear setup, escalation, and a Decisive Change for closure that lands cleanly on the page. The cost of overcoming his internal doubt is felt, and the chip's attribute acts as a persistent constraint that directly shapes the climactic action, satisfying the highest standards of structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the discovery reweights the protagonist's quest with a new, legible cost and future direction. The final image lands cleanly, making the before/after state of her motivation clear without a physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot moves from a clear inciting incident (finding the slide) to a resonant climax (carving the wood) and closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where the storm eases and her understanding shifts, lands effectively with a felt, on-page cost ("tears of revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the cost (confronting grief) is felt. The primary weakness is the causal link initiating the climax: Elara moves from postcard to the specific cathedral window based on a simple "coincidence." While an accumulative structure is more tolerant of such leaps, using coincidence as a primary resolving mechanism, rather than a complication, weakens the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story establishes a strong causal chain but collapses at the most critical point: the closure. The meta-narrative intrusion, "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count: the parley concluded...", completely shatters the narrative frame and fatally undermines the resolution. This isn't an artistic choice but a structural failure, replacing a dramatized climax with an authorial note that makes the ending feel arbitrary and unearned, rendering the story unpublishable without a complete rewrite of its final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal structure is coherent, moving from reflection to a decisive change that lands on the page. However, the closure is significantly weakened by a rushed, summarized resolution. The arrival of ships and spreading word happen via montage, skipping the consequential struggle implied by Elias's grand plan and thereby deflating the earned feeling of the revival. This "and then it worked" ending undercuts the story's otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. The central turn, driven by an accidental prophecy, functions as a perfect catalyst for internal change rather than a convenient solution. The causality is thematic and emotional, holding perfectly to its own logic, and the final image lands with undeniable, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through ritual action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is powerfully executed on the page with the thawing of the atrium, providing a legible before-and-after state. The fantastic causality (low-entropy seeds restoring order) is internally consistent and drives the plot to a satisfying and earned conclusion with a clear, felt cost in the form of duty fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is exemplary for this length, building pressure toward a single point of decision. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with details about the weather, setting, and Elias's philosophy creating the conditions for the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's choice affirms his stance, lands cleanly on the page with a clear, albeit subtle, professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands as Elias redefines his purpose, with the cost being the confrontation of his own isolation. However, the causality leading to the epiphany feels somewhat convenient, relying on a magical object to unlock a pre-packaged insight rather than a sequence of earned choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and deepening perception. The structure is clean, moving from inciting incident to a well-defined climax. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's perception restores a fragile balance—lands on the page with a clear, felt cost: the shattering of his simple solitude for a new, silent responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a well-executed Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the ledger is erased and time is re-contextualized. The structure is clean and the pacing effective. The causality is slightly weakened by the introduction of the "garage sale net," which functions as a convenient plot mechanism to solve the capsule's blueprint without dramatizing the struggle of decoding, making the solution feel somewhat easily acquired.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) when the snapped kite string redefines "brokenness" as liberation. The structure is sound and the closure lands on the page with the image of the vanished kite. However, the final moments explicitly state the resolution ("The snap was not loss, but liberation") rather than allowing the image to carry the full weight of the change, which slightly undercuts the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot structure is clear and causal, but the closure is significantly weakened by a convenient resolution. The miraculous healing ("the cancer's grip loosen") is not earned through a costly choice or sacrifice, reading as a *deus ex machina*. This turn undermines the story's literary potential by resolving the central conflict without a legible price, violating the cost-proof test for a high-tier story.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is executed with precision, following an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds toward a potent climax. The orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing, as Elara's understanding of "homecoming" is fundamentally reweighted by the final scene. The cost—the foreclosure of her purely skeptical worldview—is made legible and lands with quiet power in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with masterful control. Its single-scene structure is perfectly suited to its scope, and orientation is established immediately. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the jetty is transformed from a graveyard to a bridge of renewal, is potent and earned within the story's logic, providing a deeply satisfying "before/after" shift in meaning and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is taut and effective for its length, moving seamlessly from discovery to a powerful resolution. Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density toward a superb Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization that Elara is alive but compromised re-weights the entire story with a palpable, felt cost—the loss of a simple memory for a complex truth—making the closure exceptionally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean, propulsive causal chain from setup to a resonant closure. The final image provides a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting Elara's relationship with her past. The reveal of the compass rose's embedded chip feels slightly too convenient, a deus ex machina that neatly unlocks the console, which softens the impact of Elara’s "pariah's intuition" just before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure with a clear inciting incident, escalation, and a Decisive Change for closure. The lens is held consistently. The primary weakness is the lack of a tangible, lasting cost; the resolution is a clean victory, which slightly diminishes the impact of the stakes. The "weight of worlds" is felt as pressure, but not paid as a price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual. Orientation is immediate and clear. The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of the chessboard powerfully redefines the nature of power. The cost of her struggle against the binding is felt on the page, earning the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through the intensification of visions and memory. The structure is coherent, moving from inciting incident (finding the stone) to a clear climax and resolution. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elowen’s relationship to her past and present is fundamentally altered with a legible, felt cost—the integration of pain.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, two-shard causal structure from the cottage to the labyrinth and back, with clear motivation linking each beat. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias’s internal shift creates a small external thaw—is executed on the page with a felt cost from his trial in the maze. The Causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the final image, making the plot mechanics very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building density toward a powerful final image. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the stakes ("refracted chorus" vs. "single light") without needing to show the final confrontation. This structural choice is sophisticated, confident, and perfectly suited to the story's length and conceptual ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a ritualistic sequence that lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The structure is elegant and contained, with a clear before/after state. The cost—confronting painful memories—is felt throughout the narration, making the final steadying of the workshop a satisfying, if magical, payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, moving from a well-anchored inciting incident (the cracked mirror) to a clear climax and resolution. The narrative drive is a strong hybrid of Accumulative/Textural build-up leading to a Causal choice. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "eternity," lands with a palpable cost that is made legible in the final sentence, satisfying the core requirements for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure that is perfectly suited to its length and concept. The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias receives a "knowing"—lands with quiet power, offering internal proof rather than external spectacle. The cost is the profound emotional vulnerability required for the act, and the success is a private, earned stasis, which makes the resolution feel authentic and resonant. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Causality is one of pattern and intensification rather than linear plot turns, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure, where Elias rededicates himself to his work, lands with the palpable cost of his ongoing loss, which has been reconfigured into a sustainable purpose. The structure is elegant, and the inciting incident—the hydraulics' failure—is a perfect catalyst for the narrative's central substitution of a mechanical beacon with a human one.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is taut and precise, with each event logically building upon the last to drive Elias toward his transformative action. Closure is a definitive, on-page change in his core capability, delivered with palpable cost and a resonant "fractured harmony" that reconfigures the story's central dilemma under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing. However, the plot's causality suffers a critical break. The conclusion that the stranger "sailed away on a skiff" is entirely unearned by the preceding investigation; it feels like an arbitrary invention to soften a darker potential ending, undermining the integrity of the character's "gift" and the story's core logic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is driven by a tight, satisfying causal chain under a Causal lens, from the ants to the chip to the cavern. Orientation is immediate and clear. The story executes a classic quest structure with impressive economy, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change as Elias steps through the doorway, with the cost of leaving his past stasis legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from motivation to confrontation, and the closure form (Decisive Change with cost) is correct. However, the mechanism of the climax is critically flawed and unearned. The "fireflies' shared secret" becoming an "incantation" is an arbitrary solution that breaks causality at the most pivotal moment, undermining the resolution's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is its greatest strength. It operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear closure unit. The final act, transforming the shell, serves as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration that revalues the central relationship with a legible, felt cost (vulnerability), making the before/after state clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves an Earned Stasis, lands with a palpable felt cost as the "feral pull" is "tamed into lines of ink." The narrative arc from haunted awakening to peaceful acceptance is coherent, well-paced, and driven by a clear internal logic, with the central act of writing serving as the pivotal turn that reweights the entire emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere and memory rather than causal turns. The single-scene structure is well-handled, and orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's internal state is reweighted with a "promise of renewal," landing with a quiet but earned felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the painful crystals dissolve, is rendered with a clear and felt cost—the tears mixed into the ink. The before/after state is legible and earned without any breaks in the story's internal logic, demonstrating excellent structural control.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and atmospheric density toward a single, potent confrontation. The structure is tight, with a clear causal chain leading to the climax. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara achieves a "flawed peace," and the cost is palpable in Theo's fleeting presence and the destruction of the orchard, landing with undeniable weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an elegant Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a strong Conceptual Repricing. Closure is clean and occurs on the page ("illusions shattered... revealing a unified cosmos"), with a legible conceptual cost in the shift from history's echoes to "authentic silence."

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The magical-realist causality (counting backwards rewinds time) is introduced and executed with confidence. The closure lands decisively on the page—"Elias stood transformed"—with a clear before/after state and a tangible cost represented by the blood on his palm, making the abstract shift feel earned and concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a single-scene structure, and its Conceptual Repricing closure lands with a legible felt cost. The plot's main weakness is the convenient resolution; the "intruder" turns into a benevolent guide who possesses the exact answer to Elara's professional and personal quests. This reliance on coincidence to resolve the central tension softens the plot's impact significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through successive interpretations rather than external events. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's understanding of her father's legacy is reweighted, with the cost legible in her tears and acceptance of "clover-scented melancholy." The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's internal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and conversation toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Clara's hardening resolve is a decisive internal change with a felt cost—the finality of letting go. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the story's length and aim, making the closure feel both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The plot is an internal progression, coherently structured around Elara's deepening understanding. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where her resolve crystallizes into a new purpose; the cost is the weight of the legacy she now actively shoulders, made legible as she begins her work. Orientation is immediate and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through atmosphere rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the "cure" is redefined as the act of sharing, is earned and carries the cost of the connection's fleeting nature. The structure is slightly marred by the self-conscious line "when the story changes, midnight tolled," which briefly breaks the narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory details and memories building pressure toward a clear closure unit. The ending, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's state is altered, is effective and lands on the page. The "cost" is the confrontation with her trauma, which is felt throughout the journey, making the final peace at the stillpoint earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean causal structure, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change. The central weakness lies in the cost of this change. While the pen's nib bending again suggests fragility, this conceptual price is not felt viscerally, making the otherwise successful resolution feel too convenient and emotionally tidy for a high-stakes act of altering history.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias reframes his loneliness into a creative act, lands with palpable felt cost. The inferred lens holds perfectly, and the vintage camera provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final, resonant image of fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. Orientation is immediate, and the plot builds emotional density toward a clean Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where Elara accepts her new role with a legible cost. The final image is charged by her past (the "fire in her soul"), satisfying the 9+ test. The only minor weakness is the frictionless, "and-then" nature of the scavenger hunt, which lacks meaningful setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, adhering to a single, continuous scene that escalates perfectly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page with a clear and poignant conceptual cost ("the dream lived, if only in her"). The story's internal logic is poetic yet rigorously consistent, making for a powerful and satisfying narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens with a clear setup, escalation, and on-page resolution. The closure provides a Decisive Change with a felt cost for Marco. However, the climax relies on a convenient mechanism—a hidden hydraulic lock powered by the storm's induced currents—which feels like a late-breaking rule introduced to solve the problem, slightly weakening the causal chain's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from a tense approach to a revelatory ritual and a resonant departure. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of darkness and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara—lands with quiet power and felt cost, visible in her sigh and the re-contextualized dental mirror. The story adheres perfectly to its chosen mode, building pressure through atmosphere until the final, transformative image pays off the entire sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through layered scenes rather than direct causal turns. The structure (library-grotto-town-grotto) is elegant and effective. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the final image of the grotto humming with potential providing a powerful, cost-laden sense of a new beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The progression from finding the object to the final transformation is logical and well-paced for the length. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clearly legible cost on the page ("fighting the pain of release"), satisfying the rubric's core requirement for a high score. Orientation is established immediately and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a single, coherent scene that builds density through atmosphere and action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's internal state is subtly reweighted by the finished carving, lands with quiet power and a clear, felt cost—the continued, effortful performance of her own resilience. The final image provides a perfect conceptual cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds atmospheric pressure that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s internal state and the external world are transformed. The closure is a decisive on-page change with a clear felt cost—the loss of safe, known boundaries for a new, boundless beauty. The "before" and "after" are legible and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical progression toward its climax, with the discovery of the reed tongue serving as an effective turning point. The closure is a decisive, on-page change. The primary structural weakness is the paragraph beginning "Thorne, once a master...," which functions as an overt exposition dump, breaking from the established POV and stalling the narrative momentum to explain the world's core concept rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural drive, with a clear progression through layers of questioning that deepen the central inquiry. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara's understanding of connection is reweighted with a palpable emotional cost—accepting her brother's memory as a bridge, not a void. The structure is elegant, and the internal causality holds perfectly from the inciting incident (stabilized grid) to the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building layers of imagery and mood that pay off in a resonant climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara’s state is meaningfully altered by her action, with the cost of her past grief still legible. The causal chain is soft, fitting the lens, and the before/after state is undeniable, anchored in the final moments of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building density of understanding rather than causal plot turns. The structure is clean and effective, moving from solitary reflection to collaborative discovery. The closure is a perfect example of a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost, as Elara's private intellectual quest is reconfigured into a shared, living map for reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and effective, and the plot progresses with a ritualistic logic that builds in intensity. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara integrates the "atoms of nostalgia," lands with a clear and poignant cost—her "untainted heart"—making the before/after state legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building from observation to a climactic reconfiguration. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: the shadow is stabilized, but Elara’s internal state and the wider conflict remain unresolved, charged with the cost of her own faded dreams and the endlessness of her task. All narrative anchors are established with grace and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a single, continuous scene with clear orientation and a strong Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The internal plot arc is coherent. The central causal mechanism—coaxing a severed tail tip to regenerate with nutrient gel—strains biological credibility to a breaking point, undermining the otherwise potent symbolic action and creating a significant believability issue in the plot's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is a masterclass in economy for this length, following a single, continuous scene that flows seamlessly. The accumulative/textural lens is held perfectly, with each beat (coffee rings, plant whispers, digging) deepening the central question. The closure, a Decisive Change in understanding, lands cleanly on the page with the vision from the opal and the tangible cost of emotional release, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building thematic and emotional density toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands with a legible emotional cost ("Tears welled as Elara realized her own life echoed his") and a concrete new goal. The structure is impeccable for its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is very effective. Orientation is immediate and clear. The story progresses from a stated problem to a specific attempt, which leads to a deepening realization that redefines the necessary action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves freedom, is on the page, and the cost (surrendering her old mode of striving) is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands perfectly on the page, with the cost—Elias's continued dreamlessness—made explicit and poignant. The magical-scientific causality of the "charm" is consistent within its own established logic, and all elements build toward the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from one discovery to the next. The closure achieves a Decisive Change for the protagonist, fulfilling the initial premise. However, the climactic moment of psychological integration is summarized rather than dramatized on the page ("the hum of insight pieced together his fractured psyche"), which significantly weakens the story's core resolution by telling instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound and serves the allegorical journey well. The progression from leash-break to vigil to discovery provides a coherent arc, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's identity—lands cleanly with a felt cost (the loss of her old, fearful self). The final paragraph, showing her as a guide, feels slightly tacked-on, summarizing a future state rather than letting the moment of change resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere and memory until a key object triggers the closure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elias's role and the nature of silence, is legible and lands with a felt cost—the acceptance of permanent loss. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and internal focus, meeting the 9+ gate for a clear lens and on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal lens from the inciting incident to a decisive closure. The plot structure is flawless for this length, with each beat logically building pressure toward the confrontation. The closure unit—Varak's dissolution and the resumption of the constellations' shift—is an on-page Decisive Change, providing a clear and resonant "after" state with a legible conceptual cost (the shattering of illusion and restoration of cosmic order).

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through layered details rather than overt causal turns. The structure is tight, anchoring the reader immediately and moving purposefully toward its climax. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing (CR)—the realization that the paths have shifted, not vanished—which lands cleanly on the page with a powerful sense of earned hope and changes the character's understanding of her world.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating on an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds pressure through atmosphere and discovery. The plot moves from quiet observation to a revelatory climax without a single wasted beat. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise: Elara's internal stance crystallizes, reconfiguring the rebellion's future, and the cost (the end of the lull) is made palpable in the final line. This is a masterful execution of a short-form narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean causal chain leading to a decisive on-page closure (the unsealing of the embryo). However, it fails the cost proof test; the resolution is presented as an unambiguous victory, with the hot springs sighing in "approval" and no felt price paid for shattering tradition, which undermines the stakes at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara’s relationship to her grief shifts from a "weight" to a "seed." This change is achieved on the page with a clear, felt cost—the acceptance of permanent pain—making the final equilibrium deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds atmospheric and symbolic weight that culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the closure. The cost—confronting painful memories—is felt on the page, and the final image provides a satisfying before/after state change without needing a conventional plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain with good orientation, but the closure is critically flawed. The final line delivers a Conceptual Repricing as an explicit authorial statement, failing to earn the epiphany through on-page action and making the cost feel abstract. This is a text-book "explain-everything" ending that replaces dramatized discovery with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens with a strong sense of inevitability. The inciting incident (the pod opening) smoothly transitions into the central choice, and the structure builds to a well-executed closure. The ending is a perfect example of Charged Poise: the decisive action is taken, the consequences are understood and imminent, and the story concludes on a moment of potent, suspended tension, leaving a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural piece of this length, moving from quiet setup to a sharp climax and a resonant conclusion. Closure is achieved through an elegant Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara's endurance and ritual act re-stabilize her world with a clear, felt cost tied to her father's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless for its length. The story establishes its fantastical orientation immediately and escalates pressure by intensifying the chaotic atmosphere. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with precision, as the mending of Elias's internal fractures is mirrored by the garden's return to stillness, providing a deeply felt and earned resolution with a clear before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with excellent orientation and structure for its length. The closure, a Decisive Change, is on the page. However, the entire resolution hinges on a severe logical flaw: the "proof by contradiction" is not a proof but a symbolic non-sequitur. The idea that alien orbits affecting history would physically etch a 1923 pen nib is an unearned leap that breaks causality at the most critical moment, undermining the earned nature of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a clear and effective structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. The final action of tethering the amber creates a direct causal link to the resolution, providing a satisfying Decisive Change with a clear emotional cost. The only minor weakness is the convenient discovery of the letters, but the powerful emotional logic of the closure overcomes this.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmospheric density rather than causal turns. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the fragile peace and lingering "lilac unease" making the cost of this stillness tangible and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective structure for its length, moving from stasis to a catalyst (the tessera) and a decisive climax. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, on-page and with a clear conceptual cost in the re-framing of the past. The plot's internal logic, while fantastical, holds consistently, and the story meets the 9+ quick test as the final image is charged by a persistent object and the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The primary weakness is the legibility of cost. While Eliza's despair recedes, the price for this resolution—what is given up or risked in the "intertwining"—is not made concrete on the page, softening the impact of the otherwise effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain from the inciting incident (static shock/pill recall) to a decisive change in the characters' relational state. The single-scene structure is well-managed, and orientation is immediate. The closure, a Decisive Change where Theo's doubt is replaced by connection, lands with a felt emotional cost—the vulnerability required to create their shared art—making the structure highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative lens, moving from exploration to a discovery that deepens the initial premise. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's role, is clearly articulated on the page. While the cost—the immense burden of her new role—is intellectually legible, it is not deeply felt in the final moments, which are tonally more triumphant than weighty. The causality of the fossil enabling this shift is sound, avoiding a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the close. The primary structural weakness is the introduction of the central method; that the solution "whispered to her in dreams" is a soft causal link that feels more convenient than earned. While the closure lands effectively, this key turn relies on an un-dramatized leap of intuition, weakening the plot's overall integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Causal lens, and the closure lands on the page. The primary flaw is the convenient arrival and frictionless alignment of Marcus. While coincidence can complicate, here it resolves the core emotional conflict of isolation too easily, softening the causality of the final partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates perfectly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, using the waiting period to build atmospheric and internal pressure. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing, as Elias redefines his vow on the page ("a promise of safe passage, not eternal servitude"). The cost is the release of a familiar, generational burden, which feels both significant and liberating, landing with satisfying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. Causality is rooted in perception and discovery, leading to a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final insight—that understanding is "a gentle release"—lands with a legible conceptual cost, making the structure feel both elegant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is a clean two-shard design (fire escape to harbor) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident—the rosebush's death—provides a clear causal trigger for the emotional journey. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's stance shifts from mourning a past symbol to nurturing a future possibility, with the acceptance of loss as a legible felt cost. The before/after state is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure, moving from a state of being to a decisive action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is achieved on the page with a clear conceptual cost, as Elara prepares to embrace a new form of existence. The causal links are sound within the established fantasy logic, and the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure flows from setting to object to memory to discovery, culminating in a resonant closure. The final image of Elara joining Liora provides a powerful Conceptual Repricing of her role from isolated keeper to connected participant, with the cost of her solitude felt on the page. The central coincidence feels earned within the story's fated, whimsical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless causal structure within a single, continuous scene. Pressure builds logically toward a clear climax, and the closure—a Decisive Change—lands with undeniable, on-page consequences. The final image of an "honest silence" provides a powerful, resonant confirmation of the change, while the tempered victory ensures the cost is felt, satisfying the demands of the form perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, with each action logically leading to the next. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a decisive change—acquiring the Keystone and overcoming her fear—with a clearly legible, on-page cost (the psychological battle). The structure is immaculate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the climactic deduction is a significant weak point. The leap from sketching a ribbon to reconstructing a face and matching a stain to ink from vanished files ("The ribbon's stain matched ink from the victim's hidden sketches") feels unearned and strains credibility. This turn relies on a convenient and improbable feat of memory rather than the established methodical process, undermining the closure's causal foundation and feeling more like a magical insight than a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean causal lens, and the closure—a Decisive Change leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration—lands effectively with the nail on the map. The plot's inciting incident, however, relies on a significant coincidence: a supply drone delivering a crate from a distant shipwreck containing the exact items needed to solve Elara's specific obsession. While coincidence can initiate a plot, its sheer improbability here slightly undermines the earnedness of the subsequent discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure adheres to an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the sequence of surreal events (vanishing, flake, map) builds toward a powerful internal shift. The inciting incident is clear, orientation is immediate, and the closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing where Elias redefines his past. The cost—the shedding of his old identity—is palpable in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a multi-shard "rise and fall" structure appropriate for its accumulative lens. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is on the page with a clear cost (the business's failure). However, the causal link at the story's main turning point is weak; the rivals are "swayed by the eerie poetry" in a way that feels too convenient, softening the plot's structural integrity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from setup to a deepening dream state and culminating in a well-defined Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure, where Elara's purpose is re-weighted from personal decoding to communal healing, lands with resonant clarity and felt emotional cost (the long search is over, a new responsibility begins). The dream logic, including the mentor's appearance, functions as a motivated, non-coincidental turn within the established rules of the lucid dream state.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain on a single, continuous scene track. The inciting incident (failed spell) leads directly to the discovery, which compels the climax and resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elowen's internal state and her relationship to the setting are fundamentally altered, lands with a clear conceptual cost (confronting raw, ugly truths). The structure is elegant, disciplined, and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Decisive Change. The closure lands on the page with a legible cost—the wilted clipping—and a visible result in the brightening glade. However, the stakes, while conceptually high, feel somewhat abstract, and the cost could have been more deeply felt by the protagonist to elevate the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean, causal line within a single continuous scene, culminating in a Decisive Change. The closure unit is excellent: the barter is completed, their states are altered, and the cost is made tangible by the tarot card crumbling to dust. The internal logic of the magical "trammel" action holds within the story's frame. The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal dominant at closure) is well-supported and holds steady through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless for this length. A single scene builds pressure through reflection, anchored by a concrete object and setting. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the quarry's meaning shifts from a "scar" to an "archive," landing with the felt cost of accepting his past is truly over. The psychological causality is tight and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves Earned Stasis (peace). The closure, anchored by the sprouting seed, lands with a felt cost—the lingering grief now recontextualized. However, the causal chain of the central discovery feels frictionless; the insights from her analogical thinking arrive without significant struggle or misinterpretation, slightly softening the journey's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building a dense, atmospheric state that culminates in a ritualistic act. The structure is elegant in its simplicity, moving from stasis to action and back to a deeper, reaffirmed stasis. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is perfectly executed; the final image of the librarian continuing his vigil lands with the full weight of the "eternal now," the cost being the endlessness of the task itself.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain: discovery leads to understanding, which compels a decisive action with a clear outcome. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (DC) on the page—the caves are transformed, and Elias's purpose is reconfigured, with the felt cost of abandoning his former role. The structure is elegant and fully realized, holding its lens from the inciting incident through a powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight through a sequence of discoveries that lead to a clear closure. The final beat provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's stance is altered with a felt cost. The plot is slightly weakened by the convenience of the discoveries (map, perfectly apt graffiti, accordion) appearing in a neat, linear succession, which borders on contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal structure is impeccable for this length, moving cleanly from inciting incident to a resonant conclusion. The ending achieves Charged Poise, as the protagonist's primary goal is met while the unresolved threat of the second letter reconfigures the stakes. This creates a satisfying, tense stasis that feels earned by the preceding journey and its associated risks.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. Pressure builds through atmosphere, memory, and supernatural insight (coffee stains, plants), leading to a decisive on-page choice. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost, as her torment shifts to "poignant resolve," making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is a masterclass in economy for the Accumulative/Textural lens. A single, continuous scene builds pressure flawlessly toward a resonant closure. The final Conceptual Repricing—her essence transferred to the chip at the cost of her existence—is executed on the page with undeniable cost, leaving a powerful final image that reconfigures the meaning of preservation against the void.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens, culminating in a legible Conceptual Repricing. Closure is achieved as Elara's understanding of contentment shifts. However, the inciting discovery of the hairpin feels too convenient, functioning as a narrative shortcut to the epiphany rather than an earned consequence of the character's specific, pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure, with a clear setup, escalation, and resolution. Orientation is immediate and confident. The closure is a Decisive Change that lands squarely on the page, with the final image of the shard being filled with light providing a resonant anchor. The cost—shedding the cold comfort of rigid certainty—is legible and appropriate for the story's internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Closure is achieved through a pristine form of Charged Poise, where the final revelation of risk ("one might not return unchanged") reconfigures the stakes for Elara's life's work. The cost is conceptual but undeniably felt, landing with perfect weight for the story's philosophical aims.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is excellent for this length, following a clear causal chain from discovery to resolution. The story successfully lands a Conceptual Repricing at the end, as Elara achieves her goal but accepts a new, uncertain burden. This closure, complete with a felt cost ("the wandering pulse...stirred restlessly"), is earned and resonant under a Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from the spire to the garden and back. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elowen's self-perception, lands with a clear "before and after." The conceptual cost—re-pricing her "failures" as part of an authentic path—is legible in the final beat, creating a satisfying if quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean, effective, and follows a strong causal-accumulative hybrid lens. Orientation is established immediately, and the plot progresses logically from the inciting incident (the lanterns) to the resolution. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where Elias's reality is reweighted by his discovery, landing cleanly on the page with the felt cost of his lifelong quest now being complete. The story's internal logic is consistent and serves the final image perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain within a single, continuous scene, perfectly fitting its scope. The inciting incident (casting the lots), rising action (decoding the static), and climax (sacrificing the coins) are well-defined. The closure is a strong Decisive Change with a tangible on-page cost—the forfeiture of past securities—that feels earned and thematically resonant under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality, though magical, is internally consistent and builds to a resonant reconfiguration (RR) for a closure unit. The cost is felt as a transformation of grief into an eternal, bittersweet duty, fulfilling the on-page cost requirement for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure (Drive Lens: Causal). The orientation is immediate, and the plot progresses logically from problem to method to resolution. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the sea's return), earned through the protagonist's on-page efforts. The mechanism of "pouring understanding" into the bell is a slight abstraction but works within the story's established magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a strong, clear causal structure, with the trail of photographs effectively leading to a climactic discovery. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the town's history, is legible and occurs on the page. However, the causality of the final scene is weak; the immediate convening of the families and their instant acceptance of a new narrative feels overly convenient and summarized, undercutting the believability of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure excels under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a single, decisive ritual. The closure is a clean and effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's internal state is transformed with a clear felt cost. The story begins with strong orientation and progresses logically toward its thematic and emotional conclusion without any structural faults.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot delivers a clear progression from rising pressure to decisive action, culminating in an Earned Stasis closure. The "burden lingered" explicitly establishes the cost of her success on the page. The Situational drive lens holds, as pressure forces Elara to crystallize her stance and act, maintaining fidelity to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a strong causal lens leading to a clear Decisive Change with a felt cost. However, the plot's physical logic falters at the climax; the duplicate's body "weaving from the rift's ambient energies" is a convenient, un-scaffolded magical solution that weakens the otherwise solid cause-and-effect chain, creating a soft spot in the resolution's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean two-shard structure with a valid closure unit—a Conceptual Repricing where the seed becomes a "revolution." The causal link between receiving the seed and having a fully-formed, business-saving epiphany is convenient but acceptable for a narrative about inspiration. The cost is the embrace of risk, which is felt if not heavily dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a model of execution for the accumulative/textural lens, building pressure through intensification rather than plot turns. The single scene maintains focus, and the closure—a clear Decisive Change with the restoration of laughter—lands effectively with a felt cost in Elias's struggle. The final image of "tentative smiles" provides a resonant, non-simplistic resolution that feels earned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is elegant for its length, using a dream-state reflection to deliver the inciting incident without breaking the present scene's momentum. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is held consistently, building atmospheric pressure that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The final image of the mist parting provides a legible 'after' state, and the cost—embracing the chill of uncertainty—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene, building pressure through repeated attempts. The closure unit is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of the crozier and Elias’s destiny is reconfigured with a clear, felt cost—the severing of his past. The plot is tight, causally sound within its psychological focus, and lands its ending perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure that perfectly serves its internal focus. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, where the discovery of "a shard of hush" reweights Elara's perspective. The cost is made tangible and is paid on the page through the deliberate act of voicing and discarding her biases, making the final resonant vision feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from inciting incident to resolution, which is a strength. However, the solution hinges on a convenient backstory reveal ("grandfather's stories of such artifacts"), which feels like an unearned shortcut that lessens the impact of the protagonist's ingenuity. The closure provides a Decisive Change, but the cost—an "enduring scar"—is asserted rather than embodied, weakening the final beat's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a steady intensification of Elias's internal state and its external manifestations, culminating in a decisive pattern break. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the reformed gallery provides an earned, albeit "disquieting," peace, making the cost of his revelation tangible and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building from discovery to shared knowledge. The structure is a compressed summary of events, but it effectively serves the narrative's purpose. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the demonstration to Kai reweights the personal quest into a communal one, with the cost felt in the persistent tone of melancholy responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain, and orientation is handled effectively. The primary flaw lies in the closure unit; the Decisive Change happens off-page. Elara confronts Mira, and the final sentence summarizes her success rather than dramatizing the turn. This lack of an on-page resolution where Mira's reaction and the cost of her decision are felt makes the ending feel abrupt and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a strong initial situation but falters on causality at the climax. The solution—the "phase transitions" core—is introduced without prior setup, functioning as a convenient mechanism for the resolution. How Elias knows of its existence or its specific function is unexplained, creating a significant plot hole that undermines the earnedness of the closure. While the ending provides a Decisive Change, the lack of groundwork for the method makes the resolution feel unearned and arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a tight, elegant causal structure under the Causal lens. The inciting incident—the shattered cup—directly provides the tools and opportunity for the climax in a way that feels both surprising and inevitable. Closure is a clean Decisive Change, with Elias's restoration and the shift in Elara's heart rate providing a clear, on-page "after" state with a legible cost (the line of blood, the shard becoming a relic).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building layers of concept—the language, the canyon, the diamond, the birds—that converge in a powerful climax. The closure is a clean and resonant Decisive Change, with the cost of the transformation felt in Elar's struggle and the dimming of the diamond. The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the word count, with every element contributing to the final, inevitable-feeling transmutation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for this length, following an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to a Causal climax. The discovery of the arrowhead and then the phone creates a tight chain of events. The closure is a potent combination of a Decisive Change (metamorphosis) and Conceptual Repricing (redefining loss), landing with a clear, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure (Hybrid lens, Causal at closure) with a clear beginning, middle, and end within a single scene. The closure, a Decisive Change where the orchard is freed, is unambiguous and occurs on-page. The felt cost is slightly thin—aching fingers and a dissolving symbolic object—but it is present, making the resolution earned within the story's fairy-tale logic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under a hybrid Accumulative-Causal lens. The closure, a powerful Conceptual Repricing ("broken promises healed... in the fostered links of absence"), lands with felt cost and provides a resonant, earned reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmosphere toward a single transformative moment. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's silence is re-contextualized by song, lands cleanly with a clear felt cost—the breaking of his long-held vow. The structure is simple but coherent, with the only minor weakness being the slight convenience of the "wrong turn."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding is transformed. The closure unit is clear, but its impact is weakened by the failure of the cost proof test; there is no visible or felt cost for her profound glimpse into the archive. Her quest is simply "enriched," a net gain that lacks the resonance of a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building emotional pressure toward a single, decisive ritual. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "the longing wasn't for recapture, but for release" reweights the entire premise with a legible, on-page emotional cost. The single scene is perfectly scaled, and the lens holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is structurally sound with a very strong causal link between the star's hint (setup) and its use in the climax (payoff), leading to a clean, resonant closure that lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot unfolds with a strong causal chain from Elara's initial motivation to the final memory recovery, maintaining clarity throughout. Orientation is established early, and the inferred causal drive lens holds consistently. The closure, a resonant reconfiguration of Elara's internal state, is clearly earned with the cost of decades of prior loss addressed. The score is capped at 8.8 due to line-level artifacts in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure within a single scene, moving from inciting incident to a resonant closure. The final beat provides a Decisive Change for Lir and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara, with the cost felt through her earlier struggle. The backstory is integrated efficiently and serves the present action, making the plot mechanics feel both magical and psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is excellent. The story builds from a clear orientation to a central, ritualistic action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the restored "color of wonder" is made visible on the page. The closure lands with a felt, if subtle, cost (the weight of her duty), making the before/after state perfectly legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the intensification of silence and confession rather than conventional plot turns. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara's final peace is made legible on the page, earned by the cost of sharing her secret.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot follows a clear causal chain, with each discovery—from the map's tear to the silent footage—directly leading to the next. Closure is robust and on-page, as Elias opens the chapel door, symbolizing the crossing of the known/unknown divide and a significant resolution to his decades-long quest, with a palpable emotional and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident leading to the central scene and a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the plot's causality is weakened by a chain of convenient discoveries: the sunken ship is an improbable library containing a radio receiver which holds not only a recording but also a perfectly-themed note from a crewman. This reliance on coincidence lessens the impact of Elias's earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story presents a clean, legible causal structure under a Causal lens, moving from discovery to a decisive change at the climax. The closure, where the ghost is freed, is unambiguous and earned. The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe acts as a persistent constraint, effectively tightening the narrative and charging the final moments, satisfying the requirements for a very high score, though prose artifacts prevent it from reaching the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean, using the ten-floor elevator ascent as an effective and legible clock that contains the accumulative plot of the diary's unfolding. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) where Elara's purpose is crystallized. However, the narrative progression feels slightly mechanical, with revelations tied too neatly to passing floors, and the self-correction ("Wait, too far—") reads as an artificial, meta-narrative beat that momentarily breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through observation and reflection rather than causal turns. The structure is a clean, single scene with a clear inciting incident (tether snapping) and a resonant closure. The ending is a powerful Conceptual Repricing of "emptiness" into "archive," achieved with a felt physical and emotional cost, making the final stasis fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The structure is clean and effective for the length, with a clear orientation and a single, powerful discovery that re-frames the stakes. The closure is excellent, with the cost of the library's physical destruction made tangible against Elara's transcendent artistic insight. The discovery of the coin and book safe feels slightly convenient, but it serves to deepen the story's core concept rather than resolve an external plot problem, which is acceptable under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly structured with clean, efficient causality. The progression from a vague hint to a tangible, high-stakes map is seamless and logical for the story's length. The story concludes with a strong "Charged Poise," a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's new knowledge crystallizes future options and stakes for the entire crew, with the cost of peril clearly signaled by the captain's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and symbolic weight toward a clean closure. The plot progression is logical, moving from a broad quest to a specific, solvable puzzle. The final moment is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s identity is transformed, providing a satisfying before/after state with a felt, albeit conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear structure, but its causality is weak. The resolution depends heavily on Elias's convenient, off-page actions, such as gathering nebula seeds, which functions as a deus ex machina. While the closure is a Decisive Change, it lacks a palpable cost, as the solution is presented to the Grovekin rather than being forged through their struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery rather than causal turns. It follows a single, continuous scene, culminating in a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elara's duty is re-contextualized. The cost is felt emotionally—"her heart...cracked open," her tears—making the final resonant reconfiguration powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates flawless causal structure under a Causal lens. The inciting incident, turning point (finding the nut), and climax flow logically, driven by the protagonist's choices. The closure is an excellent Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara's relationship to her duty changes, with a clear cost and on-page proof ("the curse's hold loosening just a fraction").

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building from observation to insight to a Decisive Change (the phone call). The closure unit is legible, and the final image of the chrysalis provides a resonant reconfiguration. However, the score is capped because the on-page cost of the resolution is negligible; Lila's immediate, easy acceptance deflates the tension of years of estrangement, making the climax feel emotionally inexpensive.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a ritualistic process that leads to a clean Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure—the revelation of the "shimmering emptiness"—lands effectively on the page, with the cost being the expenditure of her prized bottled moonlight. Causality is symbolic yet coherent: her methodical quantification of absence directly causes the library to reveal its secret, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story structure is clean and effective, moving from a state of being to discovery and resolution with strong intuitive causality. The closure unit provides a clear Decisive Change with a felt cost (the arduous process in the pavilion). The use of a magical discovery (the pavilion) is well-handled and leads to a resolution driven by character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal structure, with a distinct inciting incident and resolution. The primary weakness lies in the closure: the Decisive Change (a unified community) arrives without a legible cost. Deep-seated grudges are overcome with a single song, which strains credibility and makes the resolution feel simplistic and sentimental. A key plot turn lacks the necessary friction to be convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a single, decisive internal shift. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new status quo ("the archeologist awakened") with a clearly dramatized physical and psychological cost, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive lens from inciting incident to resolution. The structure is tight for its length, with each beat logically following the last. The closure is a clear Decisive Change—Elara acquires the seeds—with the felt cost of peril faced and the new responsibility she carries, landing cleanly on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, following an Accumulative/Textural lens to a powerful close. The inciting trigger (hedgehog uncurling) is specific, and the narrative progresses with clear, quiet causality. The ending achieves a resonant Conceptual Repricing (CR) by recontextualizing silence and music, with the cost legible in the transformation of the tree's past damage into harmony. The lens holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a resonant closure. The ending is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, reframing exile as a crucible and resetting the stakes for future action. The cost—the weight of his past—is felt and re-contextualized into wisdom, landing a clear before/after shift in stance without needing a physical climax. The inferred lens holds perfectly through the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building thematic density toward a strong closure. The final beat—reading the diary—serves as a Conceptual Repricing, re-weighting the idea of "silence" with the felt emotional cost of grief. All structural elements are in place, orientation is clear, and the ending lands with resonance, fulfilling the requirements for this story length and form.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean two-shard structure with a clear transition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building sensory pressure toward a decisive climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding of serenity is fundamentally altered with a felt, on-page cost. The "turning of the tide's thought" as a trigger for the bloom feels slightly convenient, but it functions to complicate, not resolve, thus avoiding a major causal flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The plot is well-structured with a clear causal chain, following a Causal lens from the initial navigation to the final discovery. The closure is a Decisive Change (finding the arrow tip) with a Conceptual Repricing (becoming its safeguard). However, the cost is stated rather than deeply felt, and the final knowledge gain arriving as a sudden "vision" is a slightly less robust causal link than dramatized deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, following a single character through a continuous scene with a clear investigative arc. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is held consistently, building details toward the conclusion. The ending provides a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of the disaster is reconfigured into a lesson, landing with a clear, felt cost tied to the flight engineer's fate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory details rather than causal turns. The closure is a clean and powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the "sculpted hush" transforms into a resonant space, an on-page change with a legible, albeit subtle, cost (the amber sheet dimming). The narrative arc is elegant, complete, and perfectly suited to the story's length and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story structure is impeccable for its length, following an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds pressure through atmosphere. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of failure into wisdom, is executed cleanly on the page with a felt cost—the painful confrontation with her past self. The causality of the vision sequence is clear and decisive, making the final transformation feel earned and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through layered concepts and feelings. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), as Elara's understanding of "mathematics" is re-framed with a clear felt cost—the emotional overload. Every element contributes directly to this final, resonant reconfiguration, making the plot both tight and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds new purpose, is earned through a decisive on-page action with a clear cost—giving away the pendant. The final image of the shepherd turning the event into legend provides a powerful and resonant conclusion that reweights the entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure with a strong Conceptual Repricing at its core. However, the authorial intrusion in the final paragraph ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust...") is a critical flaw that shatters the narrative frame, reading as unedited meta-commentary rather than a purposeful structural choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident (finding the box) logically propels the narrative toward a powerful on-page closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's sacrifice redefines her stasis into one of active hope. The cost is tangible and deeply felt in the unmaking of her life's work, making the final image of the bare loom resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain: the planet is failing, the character has a tool and a plan, he executes the plan, and the planet is stabilized. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, landing on the page with a visible cost (the "frayed" silk) and a conceptual one ("soul for spark"). The structure is flawless for this length, with a clear setup, climax, and resolution that perfectly adheres to the inferred Causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean causal structure within a single scene, moving from inquiry to action to resolution. The ending delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the cost—the mentor's sacrifice and Elara's new responsibility—is made tangible on the page ("Tears welled as she felt its heaviness"). The drive lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to this resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered discoveries rather than overt causal turns. The progression from the stone stack to the letter chain provides a seamless intensification of emotional stakes. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts the burden of tradition, lands with a clear, felt cost, perfectly re-weighting the story's initial premise of a simple repair run.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The structure is exemplary for its length, following a single, continuous routine that functions as the plot. The story builds through an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering image and emotion toward a powerful closure. The final beat delivers a Conceptual Repricing with a clearly legible cost—the Herald’s fading role—which feels both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The single-scene structure is perfectly paced, building density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the shedding of old fears—and Elara’s final action provides a resonant "after" state, making the transformation legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The structure is sound, and the pin drop provides a potent tightening beat. However, the climax relies on a moment of unearned magic—the sextant healing itself in the moonlight—which feels more like a convenient resolution than a consequence of the character's specific, costly actions. This deus ex machina softens the integrity of the closure, making the final discovery feel granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal reversals but through a lyrical intensification of action and atmosphere, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The final image of the rekindled dawn provides a clear "after" to the "before" of the dying realm, with the conceptual cost of a new "binding" giving the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The inciting incident (finding the invitation) leads logically to the climax. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands on the page, with the felt cost being the transformation of Elias's cherished solitude. The causality is sound, with his character traits directly motivating the plot's progression from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery and ritualistic action rather than causal plot turns. The structure is a clean, single scene that moves effectively toward its closure. The final moment of "Earned Stasis"—finding a fragile peace against the encroaching normality—serves as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with a clearly felt cost: the knowledge of its impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The plot builds pressure through observation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the vows are stabilized, landing the closure on the page with the felt cost of Elara's solitary, focused vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story follows a clean causal structure of escalating attempts leading to a Decisive Change. However, the closure is catastrophically broken by an intrusive meta-commentary: "No, wait—word count must cap at 710...". This authorial note, left in the text, shatters the narrative frame, constitutes a severe structural flaw, and makes the ending feel like a draft note rather than a finished piece of storytelling, nullifying an otherwise sound plot.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and sensory evidence toward its climax. The structure is clean, moving from a journey (shard 1) to a confrontation/revelation (shard 2). The closure unit—a Decisive Change in Elara's understanding of herself—lands clearly on the page with a felt cost (the loss of her skepticism), satisfying the requirements for this length and form.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a clean, single scene with a clear closure unit (Decisive Change). The core problem is a significant causality break at the climax: the conflict of the lock is resolved by a convenient, decades-old memory. The rubric states that coincidence may complicate but not resolve; here, a highly improbable coincidence is the sole key to the resolution, which undermines the earnedness of the climax and feels like a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure, with each discovery logically leading to the next beat. The two-shard sequence (studio, then tunnels/Vault) is well-paced for this length, and orientation is excellent. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, but the on-page cost feels light. While the risk of the journey is implied, the final moment is one of pure triumph, lacking a palpable sacrifice or lingering price that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with exemplary control. The structure builds logically from activation to intensification to effect, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands cleanly, reweighting the world's emotional state with a felt cost embodied by Elias's silent, fulfilled vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from external trigger to internal crisis to decisive action. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias integrates his past rather than erasing it, with the "unburned shard" serving as a perfect image of the legible cost. The structure is flawless for its length, though capped by a line-level artifact in the final section.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight effectively through layered anecdotes. However, the plot's climax hinges on a weak causal link: the sudden, convenient revelation of the hidden key by Tomas, which reads as a deus ex machina. While closure is achieved with the opening of the mailbox, it feels unearned and the lack of any tangible cost or complication makes the resolution feel simplistic and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through imagery and tone toward a clear closure. The final sequence provides a Decisive Change (Liora is freed) and a Conceptual Repricing (vulnerability becomes a weapon), with the ascent from the depths offering a resonant image of earned freedom. The internal causality, while fantastical, remains consistent and legible from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story's structure is elegant, moving from a mysterious loss to a focused quest and culminating in a powerful Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost. The causal lens holds steady. The primary weakness is the retroactive explanation of the core mechanics in the final act ("The beached whale, he now recalled, had been no accident..."), which feels like an info-dump that lessens the mystery and earned discovery, telling the reader the rules rather than letting them be fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density and atmosphere toward a clear closure unit. The structure is a simple, elegant single scene that orients the reader quickly and effectively. The closure—an Earned Stasis where the prophecy is sealed—lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost of effort and finality, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and deepening knowledge until the climax. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), shifting Elara's understanding of the story's central premise from an academic pursuit to an empathetic one. The final action with the seal provides a concrete, on-page moment of transformation with a clear, felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through a focused, continuous internal action. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, showing a clear before-and-after state for Elara with a felt cost—the painstaking emotional labor of the archiving process—that makes her final earned stasis feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is superb; it purposefully builds symbolic and emotional density toward its climax. The closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, with Elara's unburdened departure making the internal change legible and felt. The cost—surrendering the talismanic pain of her past—is clearly articulated by leaving the thorn behind, fulfilling the core requirements for publishable work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.4)
    The plot is meticulously structured, with a clear causal chain driven by the seashell's progressive disclosure. The closure is a decisive change, beautifully rendered as Elara's song unravels the webs, with an explicit, poignant cost (her voice irrevocably changed). The inferred causal lens holds consistently, and the story's core dilemma is resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is flawless for this length, operating as a single, well-paced scene with a strong Accumulative/Textural drive. The Conceptual Repricing at the end—redefining "purity" from an artifact to an emotional truth—is powerful and lands with on-page evidence (the reformed snowflake). The only minor weakness is that the final causal leap from the specific cameos to the grand conclusion about "suppressed affections" feels slightly asserted rather than fully shown, a tell that slightly softens an otherwise excellent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery rather than causal turns. The structure, moving from the high parapet to the intimate riverbank and back, creates a logical arc for the character's deepening insight. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing, where appreciating "hidden effort" is revalued as an act of mending the soul, with the felt cost being the "ongoing audacity" required.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story follows a clean, logical causal chain from mystery to investigation to revelation, which is structurally sound for its length. However, the closure is catastrophically broken by a series of authorial intrusions and meta-commentaries in the final paragraph. Phrases like "But wait, that's over," "No, recount," and bracketed word counts completely shatter the narrative frame, making the intended ending almost impossible to land with any weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure works beautifully, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elias's role and the cost of his success, is resonant and lands on the page with the shattering of the portico. While the lightning strike is a convenient trigger, it functions as a potent symbolic culmination within this lyrical mode, making the causality feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure that is perfectly suited to its length and concept. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, landing with a definite felt cost (the tears, the lifting weight). The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the final image powerfully reconfigures the protagonist's status from vagrant to translator.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clear and effective, with the encroaching ice directly leading to Elias's proactive ritual. The ending offers a clear decisive change as the marina stabilizes and the artifact is secured. However, the sudden introduction of the solution via the crypt keeper makes the resolution feel slightly too straightforward, lacking the struggle of a harder-won discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, where the build-up of patience enables the climax. The structure is efficient, with a well-handled time-skip. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration in the form of Charged Poise; the final image of the cracking lake provides a resonant, costly final beat without over-explaining, perfectly fulfilling the demands of the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes a grounded, causal procedural framework ("empirical observation was his creed") and then abandons it for a supernatural resolution. The leap from touching a lantern to gaining specific, actionable knowledge about a modern conspiracy ("sabotage by a contractor bribing the bureau") is a significant causal break, functioning as a deus ex machina. While the closure itself is a decisive change, the mechanism that enables it is unearned within the story's own established rules, severely weakening the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent causal structure within a single, continuous scene. The progression from Elias's initial goal to his final, reconfigured one is logical and motivated. The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise, landing on a resonant final image that makes the change in stakes and the character's new path legible with a felt cost, perfectly fitting the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, compelling causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from problem (translating the runes) to method (kaleidoscope) to a Decisive Change (activating the glider). The closure is excellent, landing on the resonant image of the unheard bell, which establishes a clear "after" state for mechanical life while imposing the felt conceptual cost of pioneering isolation. The structure is flawless for its length, fulfilling all requirements for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot is a masterclass in economy, following a tight causal chain from anomaly to revelation to resolution without a wasted beat. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise; Elara’s final decision forecloses one path (whistleblowing) while crystallizing a new, dangerous role for herself. The cost is legible in her necessary secrecy, making the ending both resonant and tense, perfectly satisfying the requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a Decisive Change for closure. The central mechanism—the crystal fragment—is a convenient discovery, but its function as an amplifier of Elara's existing intuition mitigates the sense of deus ex machina. The closure lands effectively, with the resolution of the conflict providing a clear "after" state, and the cost is legible in the painful truths revealed to achieve peace.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through layered imagery and experience rather than linear causality. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Elara's understanding of "endings" is reweighted from a sound to be captured into a state to be inhabited. The cost—abandoning her obsessive quest for an uncertain future—is beautifully rendered in the final turn away from the marina's edge, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and effective. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena's perception of her solitude is reweighted, lands with emotional clarity. The inciting incident (missing the bus, Liam's arrival) relies on coincidence, but it's acceptable for this lens as it sets up the situational pressure for the emotional shift. The felt cost of confronting the past is paid and transformed into a lighter understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is a single, focused ritual that builds in intensity toward a clean closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the echo's state is permanently altered. The cost is felt in Elar's admitted fear and focused effort, making the final Earned Stasis of the wisdom feel earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the project "taking root" provides a resonant closure with a felt cost—the emotional weight of the stories now imbued with purpose. The structure is simple but effective for this quiet, reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, using the "fractured sequences" to build toward a resonant closure. The ending is a clean Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's understanding of his world is re-weighted with the felt cost of his solitary life, fulfilling the lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere and internal state toward a clear resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds stasis, lands with palpable relief. The structure is nearly flawless, but the final, overly explicit sentence slightly diminishes the power of the closing image, preventing a higher score by over-explaining the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal structure is mostly sound, but the central resolution is a significant weakness. The leap from observing a falling leaf to "etching micro-grooves that mimicked the fall's whisper" is metaphorical, not mechanical, functioning as a soft magic solution to a hard physics problem. This convenience undermines the integrity of the climax, even though the overall plot framing and closure image are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure toward a clear closure (Reunification/Peaceful Death). However, the final turn—the daughter's arrival "drawn by an inner call"—functions as a convenient coincidence that softens the causal integrity. While fitting the mystical tone, this deus ex machina resolution feels less earned than a choice made under direct pressure, slightly weakening an otherwise effective structure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain: discovery, action, revelation, and reconfiguration of the initial goal. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands with the felt cost of new responsibility, making the before/after state perfectly legible. The plot structure is flawless for this length, moving from a personal obsession to a world-restoring purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's structure is strong and adheres to a single, continuous scene with a clear causal path. The inciting discovery of the tooth leads directly to a climactic choice and a resonant resolution. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara doesn't recover her daughter but redefines her relationship to grief and joy, with the cost being the final acceptance of her loss. This ending lands cleanly with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot advances through a sequence of memories and sensory details that logically deepen the protagonist's resolve. The closure is a clear and poignant Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Elara from being "earthbound" and isolated to becoming a "bridge for others," with the cost of confronting her past trauma felt throughout. Orientation is established immediately, and the pacing is masterful for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building mood and internal state towards a quiet climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara and Kai achieve a shared stasis, lands with a clear felt cost of vulnerability. However, the causal link between observing the icicle patterns and the decision to proffer the pendant feels more like a convenient symbolic leap than an inevitable turn.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through a series of resonant images rather than external plot turns. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a decisive, on-page change—the completion of the manuscript—that carries a clear felt cost of finality and creative exhaustion, making the before/after state perfectly legible. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a linear plot structure, and orientation is handled well. However, the closure, a Decisive Change, lacks a meaningful on-page cost. The resolution is too neat—the problem is solved perfectly without any trade-off, sacrifice, or lasting consequence for the protagonist, which undermines the narrative tension and the earnedness of the happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the density of the ritual. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a superb example of a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist's internal landscape is decisively altered ("spirit alight"), and the cost of the vigil is made tangible ("body aching"), providing a powerful before-and-after state without a single wasted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is excellent for its accumulative/textural lens, building pressure through methodical observation rather than overt action. The closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, with the "blueprint for wonder" serving as a resonant final image that redefines the protagonist's purpose. The cost of confronting his own loss is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot isn't causal in a traditional sense but builds pressure through the rhythmic repetition of collecting burdens. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: no escape occurs, but the final image reconfigures Elara's reality, her options, and the cost of her vigil, which is now freighted with the weight of others' sorrows for only a glimpse of a potential path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, using the kettle's boiling as a perfect frame for the reflective shards. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis leading to Charged Poise) that lands on the page with a clear "before" (overwhelmed) and "after" (contained peace). The cost of this peace—reliving the trauma—is felt, making the final action of carving deeply earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story structure is flawless for its length, operating under a Hybrid lens that becomes strongly Causal at the climax. The initial disorientation is purposeful and serves the theme. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on the page with the felt cost of the permanently lost ambition, redefined as a "new, still narrative."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: discovery of the sextant enables the redirection of flows, leading to the terminal's revival. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, as the terminal's meaning shifts from ruin to potential, landing with a felt, if quiet, cost. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for the story's accumulative and causal aims.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure toward a clear closure moment. The ending, where Elias places the clock face, is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), showing his acceptance with a felt cost—the final release of his ambition. The structure is simple but well-suited to the internal journey, with a single, continuous scene that focuses the narrative cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a powerful closure. The final paragraph delivers a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the discovery of the journals re-frames Elias's entire life's purpose with a clear conceptual cost—the loss of his romantic self-image. The inciting incident (the instinct to dive) and climax (the epiphany) are perfectly linked, and the single-scene structure is focused and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural structure with precision, building a dense atmosphere that leads to a resonant closure. The final beat provides a clear Decisive Change (gaining the knowledge) with a felt cost in time and emotional release. While the progression is flawless under its chosen lens, a prose artifact in the final third prevents a higher score per rubric guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection. The structure is elegant, moving from a wide shot of the setting to a focused action that catalyzes the climax. The closure is a clean and powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elias's understanding of his quest is reconfigured with the felt cost of his chosen isolation. The before/after is perfectly legible, making this a structurally excellent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through imagery and atmosphere toward a powerful closure. The final discovery of the egg serves as a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration, crystallizing the protagonist's abstract quest into a concrete, high-stakes vow. The cost—the egg's immense fragility against an indifferent mechanical world—is keenly felt in the final lines, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the wanderer's smile validates Elara's quest, lands with palpable emotional cost and quiet power. The coincidental arrival of the wanderer is permissible as it deepens the situation rather than providing a causal solution. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's meditative, symbolic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, logical causal structure appropriate for its length, moving from inciting incident to resolution without deviation. The closure is a decisive on-page change driven by the protagonist's action. The cost is primarily one of endurance ("sidereal patience," "night's chill"), which feels slightly less impactful than a direct trade-off, but it is present and sufficient for the story's fairy-tale logic.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, where momentum builds through the intensification of mood and theme rather than causal turns. The ending lands a quiet but effective Conceptual Repricing, as the final image ("cycles unbroken...sigh persisting") re-weights the protagonist's success with the cost of inevitability, providing legible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens masterfully. The structure, unfolding over the weeks of the migration, builds thematic and emotional density rather than causal tension. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias achieves an Earned Stasis ("peaceful resonance," "thundering calm"), his internal state reconfigured by his journey. The cost is the emotional labor of his meditative work, made tangible in the completed stone, providing a satisfying and legible conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story exhibits a masterfully executed causal structure, with each beat flowing logically from the last. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (DC) with a legible cost—public confession—earned directly by the events of the climax. The visionary sequence, triggered by the pendulum's pause, functions as a perfect crucible for the plot, though the introduction of the rake handle as a physical object post-vision slightly strains credulity without harming the core causal chain of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is excellent for its Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from routine to discovery to a well-earned Conceptual Repricing at closure. The link between Elias's personal chess game and the historical one he uncovers provides elegant thematic causality. The ending lands cleanly on the page, reconfiguring his understanding of the past with a subtle but legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless "Charged Poise" closure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and interiority, culminating in a final, reconfigured moment where all options and stakes are made legible. The cost—the immense risk of implementing her plan against the council's decree—is clearly felt in the final lines, making the poised action deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot builds through a deepening of knowledge rather than overt causal turns, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, with Elias becoming a conduit, lands with a clear conceptual cost—the risk of defying the censors—making the 'before' and 'after' legible and charged with potential.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory detail and symbolic action toward a powerful closure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The closure unit is a superb example of a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the mask on the stilled chair, as "safety's illusion dissolved," reweights the entire narrative with a profound and legible cost. The structure is tight, focused, and purposeful, making the single scene feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from philosophical stasis to a decisive internal shift. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure unit is an excellent example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing on the page with a clear, felt cost—the permanent loss of the old ways to the wider world.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing on a final image of Elias "expectantly resigned to the next uncertain chord," which reweights the entire narrative with a felt conceptual cost—harmony is a continuous, fragile practice, not a final victory. The structure is perfectly suited to the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, establishing a clear before-and-after state change for the greenhouse. However, the structure is critically weakened by a complete absence of felt cost. The successful planting and growth are frictionless, undermining the closure's emotional weight and making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, causal structure leading to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure. The final image, where Elias closes the box, provides a legible "after" state where wonder has been successfully curated, paying the cost of revealing a mundane secret. The lacquer box serves as a persistent constraint shaping the tactics of the reveal and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing for its closure. The primary flaw is a break in causality and POV when an omniscient narrator announces the significance of Elias's discovery before he has processed it himself. This moment interrupts the otherwise smooth progression from observation to action to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene causal structure. The inciting incident (Elara's confession) logically triggers Lirien's revelations, which in turn necessitate the climactic action. The closure, a combination of a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, is on-page and carries a legible conceptual cost (the shattering of Elara's old worldview), satisfying the rubric's core requirements for a strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is achieved on the page through the protagonist's direct action and provides a resonant "after" state. The cost—the destruction of his reality—is re-framed as a triumph, a price he willingly pays, which feels both earned and inevitable given the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with precision. The structure is a single, unbroken scene that builds emotional and thematic density toward a clear closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves Earned Stasis from his insomnia. The final image provides a Conceptual Repricing of his art as an "invocation," landing with a subtle but definite felt cost (the preceding struggle) and gain (peace). The causality is internal and entirely coherent within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clear causal structure under a hybrid Accumulative/Causal lens. The closure is a decisive change (reviving the custom) that lands with a legible cost (original tools corrode, the revival is fragile). The one minor weakness is the slightly convenient physics of the opera glass accelerating the thaw, but it serves the climax by centering protagonist agency, so the impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is elegantly causal, moving from discovery to execution with clear stakes. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of what it means to defy fate, lands with a potent and legible cost on the page ("...leaving him forever changed in a world still shadowed"). The structure is flawless for this length, though a prose artifact in the final beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but its causality is weakened by convenience. The dream dictionary appears precisely when needed to provide the solution, functioning as a late-stage key rather than an integrated discovery. The closure, a Decisive Change, lacks a visible cost—Elara is simply freed—and the mechanism (a mental "photograph" rebounding a curse) feels abstract and unearned, softening the impact of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building atmospheric pressure toward a single, transformative climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard achieves a new harmony, is earned and lands with conceptual weight. The structure is simple but elegant, with a clear before/after state, and the cost is legible in the initial threat of annihilation that is successfully transmuted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's causal structure is flawless, moving from question to action to revelation with compelling logic. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the devastating answer redefines the protagonist's goal and leaves her with a terrible, high-stakes choice, all rendered legibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure is simple, elegant, and effective for a short reflective piece. The closure unit is a potent Conceptual Repricing—re-evaluating the "noble lie"—that lands with a clear, felt cost tied to personal memory, satisfying the rubric's highest standards for a non-causal design.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for this length, following a clean, single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to a Causal choice at the climax. The closure is a clear Decisive Change ("forever changed...archeologist...awakened"), landing on the page with a felt professional and personal cost. All orientation elements are established gracefully, and the internal causality leading from discovery to decisive action is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly structured with clean, causal logic. The discovery of the stamp leads directly to the hypothesis, which is tested and yields a revelation. The story concludes with a strong Charged Poise, reconfiguring Elara's mission and the story's stakes with a clear, felt cost of the immense task ahead. The inferred Causal drive lens holds perfectly from start to finish, and the closure lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot expertly structures Elias's internal journey, moving from an externalized turning point (shadow detachment) to a powerful internal resolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens is consistently maintained, building emotional density through Elias's ritualistic actions. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration to "fragile peace"—is clearly earned on the page with legible cost and feels deeply satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens from inciting incident to resolution. The structure is tight, with the system reboot providing a perfect container for the escalating action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into a state of Charged Poise, is executed flawlessly; the final image of Elias stepping into the void reconfigures his grief into a tangible mission, with the cost of his humanity fueling his vengeance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate, and the single scene builds density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration for a closure. The final realization that the frequency exists "in the interstices" provides a perfect deepening, and the felt cost—the mending of her solitude—is legible on the page, satisfying the core requirements for an exceptional piece.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is elegant and effective, moving from terrace to shore and back, mirroring the journey from stasis to decision. The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery and reflection. The closure is a clean and earned Charged Poise; the on-page decision to speak has a clearly felt cost, fulfilling the requirements for a powerful, quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal lens in a single, well-paced scene, demonstrating excellent structural control. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias's internal state shifts with a clear, felt cost (the loss of his talisman) that is earned by the preceding action. The final image provides a powerful, legible sense of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain until the final paragraph, which completely fails as closure. The inclusion of meta-textual authorial notes like "[Word total: 510-710 achieved...]" and "[Final: 685]" shatters the narrative frame, replacing an on-page Decisive Change with a summary of one. This is a catastrophic structural flaw that makes the ending illegible as a story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.2)
    The causal chain is logical and the core structure is sound up to the climax, with a clear Decisive Change. However, the story completely collapses in the final paragraph with the jarring, meta-narrative self-correction ("But wait, that's over—recalibrate..."). This breaking of the fourth wall shatters the narrative illusion and represents a critical structural failure, rendering the piece unpublishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, leading to a Decisive Change at closure with a clear, felt cost (shedding her human form). The inciting incident, a fortune cookie appearing in a fairy-tale orchard, requires some suspension of disbelief but effectively kicks off the plot. The plot mechanics are sound and the ending lands with satisfying, if predictable, causality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates perfectly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is an elegant single scene, building emotional and atmospheric density toward its climax. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s internal state is palpably changed ("the weight of lost time lightened"), providing a clear "after" with a felt cost—the painful but cleansing confrontation with her past.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a coherent ritualistic sequence. The closure unit provides a decisive change with a legible, if abstract, cost (the psychic toll of processing trauma). The structure is tight and effective for its length, with every beat logically contributing to the final, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing for closure. However, the structure is significantly weakened by the brief, unmotivated POV shift to the "local elder." This device functions as a clumsy expository shortcut to deliver the prophecy, breaking the established narrative frame and undermining an otherwise coherent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain from the inciting incident (blackout) to the resolution. The inferred Hybrid (Situational->Causal) lens holds, and the structure is sound for the length. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing on a final image where the stakes are reconfigured with a clear, felt cost—the irrevocable start of a dangerous revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building density through ritual and imagery toward a clear climax. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The closure unit is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara’s relationship to her curse is transformed on the page, and the conceptual cost of transcending her former life is made legible and poignant. The lens holds perfectly from the opening sentence to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for this length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The timer's countdown provides a steady increase in pressure, leading to a Decisive Change (acting on his mission) that is triggered on-page and carries a palpable cost—leaving his sanctuary. The closure is resonant, reconfiguring his relationship to the world, and fully earned by the preceding vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain within a single, continuous scene. The discovery of the needle card leads directly to the use of the sundial, which causes a re-evaluation of the impending conflict. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the entire narrative premise on the final beat with a palpable sense of risk and potential. The lens is causal and holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a resonant mood that pays off in the final image. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library becomes a symbol of hope, is earned and carries a felt cost (the persistent threat of the guards). The structure is somewhat loose, relying on a "weeks blurred" summary which slightly diffuses the narrative pressure that a more contained scene might have offered.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Causal lens: the dropped clock leads to the film, which inspires the musical performance. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "anchored in longing's defiant song," lands effectively with a clear conceptual cost—repurposing grief rather than erasing it. The plot relies on the slightly convenient dual discovery of the film reel and the clock's hidden compass, which prevents it from reaching a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the narrative progresses through a series of deepening textural states rather than simple causal links.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries and motifs, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in embedding notes that reweights the pavilion's absences with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early with the drawbridge and Elias at the water's edge, serving the accumulative payoff. Closure lands on-page with Elias forever changed, a cadence shift charging the ending image. Minor ellipsis in the repair process doesn't break pattern coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure fits single-POV, continuous scene with accumulative/textural lens, building through perceptual deepenings to a conceptual repricing closure where realization reweights Thalassara's fall with conceptual cost of biased annals. Orientation anchors early in sunken library during blackout; one meaningful deepening via alternative hypothesis suffices. Strength in motivated ellipsis changing knowledge, as in stamp's alignment with maps; minor slip in outline-like sequencing of realizations without stronger causal links, but lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elision of crafting beats, with one meaningful deepening as cranes take flight, leading to resonant reconfiguration in fragile peace with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (floating island tea garden/basilica), and when (after shadow detachment and Lira's passing) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Closure lands on-page via the island's paradoxical motion mirroring soul's ascent, reweighting grief without decisive physical act but with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor slip in ellipsis of gem polishing details doesn't break lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the single-scene structure builds density through reflective perturbations to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final initiation and void-step, with felt cost in his scarred resolve reweighting prior loss. Orientation anchors early in the observatory's hum above war-torn Earth. One meaningful deepening via the crystal's pulse suffices, though ellipsis in visions feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal cues.

Closure lands on-page with the matrix chip etching the code, reweighting belonging's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Charged Poise closure where Elias vows to reveal the truth, reconfiguring his guilt with felt cost in the "fragile peace" line; orientation anchors early on the terrace, and one meaningful deepening via the watch hand suffices, though the elliptical reflections occasionally soften causal links without breaking the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through atmospheric density and a single meaningful deepening at the exchange's midpoint pause, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the mist-lifting closure with felt relational cost; orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via motivated symbolism and protocol, though ellipsis in backstory is more declarative than pressure-tested. The final image reweights enmity into tentative peace, satisfying closure requirements without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards with pattern breaks in the journey, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final embrace where regrets reprice with felt cost; orientation anchors early at the coastal launch, and causality holds via motivated deepening without breaks. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the dolphins and poles accumulating pressure effectively. Closure lands on-page with undeniable reconfiguration under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, from clinic emergence to apartment discovery to subterranean journey, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elias emerges changed with empathy kindled. Orientation anchors early in the clinic and apartment, with deliberate disorientation in the labyrinth paying off at closure by mirroring his choices. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in weeping and confronting visions, though the looping ending recalibrations slightly dilute the decisive change. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the path choice narrows options toward empathy's spark.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through sensory invocations leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the transformation and reunion, with felt cost in her permanent wolf form legible in the howling climax. Orientation anchors early in the orchard under moonlight; one meaningful deepening occurs via the fortune's prompt, tightening options without redundancy. The pattern of cosmic whispers pays off at closure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, with orientation anchored early in the midnight glade and Elara's post-birth ascent; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via the blooming repentance and lightened weight, with felt cost in tears and regained grace. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the ritual accumulates to reweight lost time. No orientation penalty, as anchors are clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through ritual shards with legible transitions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dimension opens with conceptual cost of releasing humanity's ghosts; orientation anchors early in the spaceship's silence. Closure lands on-page with the final stitch and soft wind, reweighting stakes via peace, though causality feels more pattern-based than strict linkage. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor elision in shadow integration slightly softens payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure fits a mosaic track with legible shards (trail, ravine, beach) under an accumulative/textural lens, building density through imagery and coincidences to a conceptual repricing at the end where Elias grasps transformation's texture with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early with Elias wandering toward the beach, and the detour provides a meaningful deepening without causality breaks. Closure lands on-page as charged poise amid the glowing sands, reweighting his life's premise, though coincidence-driven turns border on resolving rather than complicating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of light and shadow to a resonant reconfiguration in the cradle, with the blackout anchoring orientation early and serving closure by cloaking movements. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in the risky spark ignition, reweighting the fort's glow. However, some causality feels elliptical, like the unexplained blackout's origin, and the descent shard transition is legible but lacks a sharper tightening. Orientation is solid by 120 words, waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through ritual shards with patterned elision, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Charged Poise as Elara steps toward reunion, with felt cost in her tears and curse's torment; orientation anchors early with the tidal bluff and aurora. One meaningful deepening suffices, as dust activation and eel helix reweight knowledge. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost, holding the lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards linked by storm imagery and timer ticks, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where scars reconfigure as a "wondrous guide to freedom" with conceptual cost of persistent exile. Orientation anchors early in the observatory above clouds during a stormlit vigil. One meaningful deepening occurs as the timer's bell propels descent, with felt cost in leaving the serene dome for the fray below.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations from the needle card and sundial, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the Charged Poise of alliance, with conceptual cost in reweighted rivalry. Orientation anchors who, where, and when immediately in the atrium beside the brook while waiting, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via the decoded overture, sufficient for scope, though the solitary practice beat slightly loops without sharper causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern breaks in Elias's molting and the library's transformation building to a resonant reconfiguration in the ending, where resistance blooms with felt cost from the guard's suspicion; causality is motivated through friendships and whispers, though some time jumps feel elliptical without tighter orientation anchors past the initial 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through motif accrual like the film reel and compasses, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the crescendo where the clock whirs to life with conceptual cost of reweighted fate. Orientation anchors early with Elias climbing the arbor, and one meaningful deepening occurs when he projects the film, tightening options toward the encore. Closure lands on-page with visible cost in the lingering chord bridging past and future, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through motif patterns of blooms and doubt, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where ritual awakens memories with the cost of enduring uncertainty legible in the final image; orientation anchors early via ridge and pre-monsoon sun, with dream shard transition legible. One meaningful deepening via ancestor riddles reweights knowledge, fitting scope without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final voicing of regret with conceptual cost legible in the cerulean bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each layer of dust and rust accumulates until the final overlay reweights her perception of stellar decay. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 w; causality remains coherent—no teleporting props or info dumps. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dust–star overlay makes the cost of her past hype undeniable and forecloses old methods. The beat could tighten further—one more beat showing her actively discard or delete an old simulation file would crystallize the DC/RR edge.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene arc holds: ambush → flight → dawn revelation → new purpose. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she pockets the strip and commits to expose the trade through glass—cost is the forfeiture of her former isolation. Causal chain is tight; only a slight ellipsis in the chase beat keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each heat-map and fork-strike layers density until the final chord reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s private trauma transmuted into collective harmony—whose cost is the irreversible silence outside. Causality holds; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: package → lens → blood → impossible space → re-forging → souls shelved. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses his own escape from the library, price paid in lingering bifurcation ache. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “chased stillness” repeated three times early could tighten, but beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s single toll turns anonymity into formal alliance, cost visible in the shared breath-hold that follows. Accumulative lens holds—each midnight donation adds density until the public vow crystallizes. Orientation clean: ridge/valley/curfew anchors arrive by line 5. No causal breaks; the declaration grows organically from prior relay.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared breath ritual reweights the premise, releasing stored love and mending both wound and memory. Causality is lyric rather than linear, yet the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the final image of “eternal breath” crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine is clean: fragment found → visions → disintegration → freedom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s pulse syncs with his breath, a felt cost that reweights his stance toward time.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: cipher → vault → planting, each beat because/therefore linked. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s kneeling sowing crystallizes the new era’s cost and possibility. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation debt. One transition (carnival to field) is legible and brief. The lens holds from first to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the device hums alive, trust-fracture becomes “a faint, healing hum,” reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost. Causal chain—betrayal → absence gathering → imprint → new aurora-hearing—holds under the inferred Causal lens. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “cells divided” is invoked thrice but never alters tactics; it acts as decorative clock, not constraint, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds: flower code → portrait → moonbeam jar → cosmic map. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as moonlight rewrites the painting and Elara’s role; causality is lyric rather than tight, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is coherent and the cost—loss of anonymity, burden of guardianship—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early: each new drip or revealed spark increases the density of thaw, reweighting the stake from nostalgia to survival. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elias pockets bookmark and orbs, exits into “melting wilds,” crystallizing before/after with both conceptual cost (he can’t go back) and felt loss (abandoning the only hearth he’s known). One scaffold paraphrase near midpoint (“he narrated onward, his tone…”) slows but does not rupture the cadence. Orientation anchors within 120 words; spatial logic holds; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: seashell warming → cipher → exposure → trap; the mid-scene reflective block is proportionate and anchored, and the Earned Stasis ending pays a visible social cost (sirens, bound mentor). One minor causality bump: the stunt-gadget speaker is retro-introduced yet accepted under paranoia seeding, so closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lone star winks out, reweighting the premise—her map is now internal, the cost endless night. Causal linkage holds: because she chooses silence over inscription, the star’s light is spent. Orientation is anchored by the ridge fort within 120 words; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative design holds: each timeline braid thickens the stakes of perception; closure lands as Charged Poise—violin down, sweep resumed—so the cost (wider, heavier sight) is felt. One causal seam wobbles: how the ice violin arrives is untethered, but it’s accepted as situational intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared ticket-doodle reconfigures isolation into connection with visible cost—Elias’s registrary neutrality is forfeited. Causal chain holds: lens find → eavesdrop → intervention → reciprocal doodle, each beat tightening options. One transition (shadows to bench) is legible; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story lands a resonant reconfiguration: the vine’s resurrection of the marble reweights Elias’s lifelong stance against data-driven fortune, and the cost is felt in the hush that follows his smile. Causality is tight—each polishing beat foreshadows the climactic return—and the maze’s seasonal decay mirrors the tightening stakes. Closure is on-page, wordless, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: twilight rest → sync idea → lever pull → sideways bloom. The 120-word anchor clears—station, frost world, alien habitat all land inside the first paragraph. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the branching hologram proves time’s lateral weave and reweights their scientific worldview while the warm “icy” air signals unseen energetic cost. Lens holds causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro-fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the program dissolves, the veil reseals, and Elias stands in “heavier hush,” the cost being the irretrievable loss of the code. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the mood until the final image crystallizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes in the final image of descent, the cost legible in the relinquished isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each sensory layer (aurora, frost, paper texture) reweights the stake until the last line. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift. One minor ellipsis (how she first swallowed the truth) is motivated and paid off in the fever dream recall.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: find relic → hear callers → meet ghost → hear confession → own guilt, each step because/therefore; the valve-as-talisman tightens the linkage and the hush-moment supplies a charged poise closure with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words and the single transition (tunnel → chamber) is legible. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the obsidian refuge crystallizes options—he can keep witnessing, now healed by silence—cost legible in the buried library above. Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors within 120 words; only the swan’s first appearance could be cued a beat earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl transferred from Elena to Theo crystallizes a new shared stance toward loss. Causal chain—eclipse approaching → harmonica lesson → breath-sync under totality → talisman exchange—tightens without gaps. Orientation is anchored early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal lens is cleanly maintained: the scholar’s medieval diaries & fire are both setup (setup-gate met) and payoff that reconfigures Elowen’s quest at closure. Orientation anchors by line 80 and the burning fragments create visible conceptual cost without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: fortune drafted → microdot etched → cookies dispatched → prophecy leaks back. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Maris pockets the slip, proving the island’s agency; Elias’s orchestration becomes the island’s orchestration of him, with the felt cost of lost authorial certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is tight: possession advances → loops counter → entity recoils → anchor stabilizes. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: Elias foregoes further pursuit of the entity, accepting perpetual vigilance. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn light pierces the hush, the shell becomes baton, symphonies “swell” with felt cost—his last reserves spent. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mapped memory adds density until the final blush of day reweights the premise from retreat to command. No orientation debt; glass spire, frozen lake, pre-dawn clock are anchored by word 80. One scaffold-only nit: “upturned hush” is repeated four times without pattern payoff; trim one instance for 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—viaduct glow undimmed, time poised—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the image does reconfigure meaning; however, the cost is only asserted (“timelines fusing”) rather than dramatized through a forfeiture we can feel. Causality inside the labyrinth is weak: the tablet illuminates a path, but every corridor is a summarised memory; no single wrong turn or re-readable rune narrows her options. The final surge conquers the maze because the text declares the maze was self-imposed, not because an irreversible choice forecloses a live alternative. Thus the resonance is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed song’s vibrations literally break her numbness, the cost etched in silent tears. Causality is tight—because she rigs the needle backward, therefore the hush pierces her. Orientation is immediate; the cavern’s geography and Thorne’s absence are anchored in the first 120 words. Closure is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of vibration accumulates until the emotional pattern ruptures.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias stays on his knees, scent washing over him, path foreclosed with visible emotional cost, all under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight—uncork → UV bloom → ghost-hologram → surrender—each step triggered by the last. The late placement of Elara’s death (past-tense summary rather than scene) mildly blunts the before/after contrast, but the final image still reweights the premise, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure works under situational lens: the final renunciation (letting rope drop) reweights meaning without erasing prior escape. Causality holds; each beat narrows the impossible choice toward a crystallized stance. Loss of past-escape rope memory is the felt cost at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bowl’s inversion crystallizes the shift from solitary mourning to communal creation, with the felt cost that Elias cedes the last word. Causality is accumulative/textural—each added story tightens the weave until silence itself is reweighted. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift. One hairline slip: the phrase “magnificent simplicity” is used twice, slightly blunting the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: empathic fusion lands in the final breath with visible price—her laugh is “unfeigned,” the grotto light “fleeting,” signalling detachment is gone. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density, pulse of amber walls, and static prickles intensify until knowledge/feeling divide reweights. Orientation anchored by word 60; no confusion. Single beat of causality (because she inhales the half-truth, therefore her barriers break) is enough for this length; cost is legible in crumbling petal and irrevocable laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene arc anchored by 120-word mark; causality flows from envelope mis-delivery → locket discovery → partnership offer, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s cargo network pledged to Mira’s archive, cost framed as ongoing commitment rather than single act. One minor ellipsis—how Elias instantly identifies Mira as the intended recipient—slightly blurs motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single causal chain from first orchard dusk → shared search → crater descent → arbor dedication, all under a tight situational lens. Closure leverages Charged Poise: the arbor glows with new kinship cost. Minor bump: orientation anchor drifts at the 200-word mark before the crater scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal linkage tightens cleanly: inciting desire → interrupted cadence signal → borrowed-time mechanics → uncage gate → echo-uncaging payoff. Closure (CR) reweights what infinity means with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each refracted thread thickens the pattern until the final image reweights grief as an additive term. The chipped stepping stone teaches its rule early and returns as the pivot where light threads dovetail, delivering a Charged Poise with conceptual cost legible in the glowing numerals that now map her absence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias steps into visibility, leaving the tape and note as charged artifacts. The sapphire-hush motif bookends the piece, re-weighting the opening silence into an invitation. Causality holds—every cache and encounter flows from the outage and the tape discovery. One hairline slip: the woman’s arrival feels lightly coincidental, not forced but not fully seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: storm → anomalous leaf → sympathetic-bond lore → deliberate surrender → hybrid transformation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost: tendril fingers, slowed pulse, dawn recognition that the change is permanent. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the “ancient texts” beat is off-stage exposition, slightly blunting the because/therefore edge.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the exchange of brooch-for-story-and-water reweights Elias’s sleepless stance into earned slumber, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is linear and coherent; however, rain-trail mapping is declared rather than demonstrated—droplets are never shown steering his route—so the central method feels lightly teleported.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: vision gap → pearl touch → inhabitation; the final Earned Stasis (body claimed, will overwritten) carries visible cost. One micro-turn beats here: lens flips from amplification to possession, tightening options under the inferred Causal lens; only a trace of latency in foreshadowing the possession rule prevents 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the trumpet hum reweights exile from loss to resilience. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is collective, not personal—so the price is audible but not tethered to Elara’s own foreclosure; still, the pattern taught early pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the glowing rune and spectral train constitute a decisive change that reconfigures her options. Causal chain—cracks → ravine → vault → punch → train—holds under a causal lens, though the leap from urban pavement to starlit cavern is abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is tight: because Lir arrives, because Elara decides to transcribe, the memories surface and re-bait the ending. Closure lands as an earned Resonant Reconfiguration where grief is reprocessed and a quiet space is carved.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elowen gains a charged new stance (“eternity… thrummed with possibility”) paid for by the shard’s spent burn and the sealed breach. Causal chain holds—boredom → storm → shard → mutiny → glimpse → cost—without jumps or retro-fixes. Orientation is fixed by word 40 (“prismatic escondite… hidden within the folds of reality”). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens the final image reweights all prior prismatic imagery; no lens contradiction at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: ink drop → seal melts → letter reveals formula → Elena pockets it and recalibrates her stance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her father’s “legacy of calculated honesty” reweights the entire past. The prep-room limbo is anchored early and paid off in the final pulse of “deathly vitality.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias leaves the mountain carrying a notepad of “invented histories” whose truth-value now bears the town’s survival—visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the final descent reweights earlier pattern. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One soft spot: the town’s voice-stealing blight is declared off-stage and never re-enters as concrete constraint, so the stakes feel grafted rather than tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held to the Charged Poise closure atop the container. Each shard adds density rather than causal linkage; the final image crystallizes the collected histories into a coherent, solitary identity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words. Closure carries conceptual cost—the wanderer’s life is now defined by fragments not their own—but the price is more inferred than viscerally felt, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causality unfolds as “because he plucks the cello, therefore buried voices retell”; each echo tightens his option space until enduring the final hum is the only path, landing Earned Stasis with felt cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure reweights his crusade under Accumulative/Textural lens; persistent price (loss of debunker armor) is legible on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vote to incorporate on their own terms reweights the stakes and forecloses pure anarchy. Causal chain holds—each graffiti mural tightens communal bonds until the final phoenix image. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift. The persistent constraint (privatization deadline) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the stake of vanishing quiet. The hourglass grain → chem-message → final spectral projection is a taught pattern that reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is secured within 50 words; geography never drifts. Cost is legible in the last frame: she descends, summit scheduled for rockets, photo the lone salvage—Earned Stasis complete.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended drone departs, crystallizing Elias’s choice to release guidance rather than hoard it. Causality is tight—every beat flows from damaged drone → diagnosis → patch → release—under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to leave the outpost recharts world flow and carries the implicit price of solitude. Causal chain (falcon→note→condensation→recognition→departure) is tight, lens held, cost legible in the final image of reforming frost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archway’s faint peal reconfigures possibility with undeniable conceptual cost—collapse is still imminent, but communal rhythm now carries the price of continued effort. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each footstep accretes density until the bells answer. Orientation is clear by word 60. No tightening beat narrows Elowen’s own options, so the cost is communal, not protagonist-specific; this caps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causality holds: vial uncorked → hush released → memories flood → kelp triggered → calm override → escape. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward impermanence crystallizes as she pockets the vial and re-signals. Cost is felt—air nearly gone, isolation intact. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elias threads his own story through the lattice, reweighting the fable’s meaning. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each echoing image (scuffs, lattice, copperlight) layers density until the final cadence releases it. Orientation is anchored by the skiff’s approach and the reef’s teeth within the first 120 words. Causality holds: the confession rewrites the curse, and the door swings wider as tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is tight: a pulsing heirloom bead triggers ghost visitations that flood Elias with memories of betrayal, driving him to experiment until he willingly dissolves into the bride’s world. Closure is on-page and resonant—the bead falls, their essences fuse, and the greenhouse dims to perpetual hush—while cost (his corporeal life) is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s “tomb of ruins” becomes a “living poem” through Elara’s stitched light-paths, with felt cost—her lifelong vigilance implied by the final sigh. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each overlapped sleepwalk accumulates into the glowing map. One micro-drag: the communal arrival is slightly off-stage, blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of dig-find-rebuild tightens toward the sundial restoration.  Closure lands as Charged Poise—“quiet enchantment of continuity”—but cost is only asserted (“lost faith reignited”) without an on-page forfeiture or image that makes the price legible; thus RR is present yet under-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dawn light, chalk dust, and mailbox silhouette layer into a Charged Poise that reweights nostalgia as tactical resistance. Cost is legible in the fading chalk and the impending drone-world erasure; the closure image crystallizes meaning without forced exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara crystallizes her stance—she will smuggle the synchronized chart rather than confront—foreclosing open defiance with the felt cost of ongoing secrecy. The causal chain (because she overheard comet whispers → therefore she maps discrepancies → therefore she hides the proof) holds cleanly under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “moment returns; decide anew” reweights the past with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of condensation → message → vapor teaches the rule early and pays off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. Every beat accretes density: spirits’ song, shard pulse, window texts; no causal break. Cost is legible in the evaporating apology—silence finally released, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: twilight, mist, coral, cast-notes layer into a single cadence that culminates in the coral pocketed again—an Earned Stasis whose cost is only the ache we already had. No causal tightening occurs; the decrypting simply continues until the text stops. Orientation is clear by ~60 words and the pattern holds, so no penalty, yet the closing stasis feels preemptive rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the light-mural blooms and Elias exits with renewed resolve; the cost is the ephemeral nature of the gift—he can keep only the spark, not the scene. Causality is dream-soft—fog parts, knowledge network answers on demand—but within the declared daydream logic the sequence coheres. Orientation is swift; no penalty. Minor loop: “pensive mirth” phrase repeats without escalation, dulling the final beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Perhaps the secret is in the asking” crystallizes new options under the garden’s vibrating leaves, the felt cost Elias’s jettisoned certainty legible in his blank notebook. Drive is Accumulative/Textural: echoed motifs (coin, fox-grin, crimson bloom) intensify until meaning re-weights; the bass note nesting inside itself is the pattern break. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor loop: “methodically playful precision” appears twice—scaffold rather than escalation—keeps this just under 9 full.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted gourd’s rattle becomes a living cipher, foreclosing capture. Causal chain is tight—seed → warp → drone baffled—but the initiation beat is slightly rushed, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated song-images thicken until a cadence-shift reweights pain into beauty. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the spectral blossoms crystallize the new stance with visible cost (“insomnia softened into watchful wonder”). Orientation is lyrically delayed yet coherent; shell, postcard, and song-pattern are taught early enough to serve the final image. One paraphrase loop (“centuries of longing… centuries of longing”) slightly dulls the tightening arc.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chime’s restored song reweights the library’s silence and crystallizes Elowen’s stance—she will keep mending despite inevitable loss. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; the song-echo mends the tube, a rule taught early and paid off. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last harmonic chord converts silence into shared forward risk, foreclosing permanent separation with felt cost—the inked vows could still destroy them. Causal chain holds: because Elara dares the Eldari script, therefore the symphony forces public honesty, therefore Thorne can realign beside her; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation is pixel-clear by line 5; no debt applied. At 748 words the single-scene default is satisfied, and the one transition (mute rift → harmony) is internal, signaled by the rising chord.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decoded plea reweights the chain and the entire engineering ethos. Causal linkage is tight—each beat (discovery, analysis, tremor) tightens options toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteorite under the skylight reweights the entire attic from site of erasure to site of renewal. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each paper trail and dust-mote map accrues until the joint message to the world redefines the space. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the terrace tilts homeward after she whispers codes,Cost is conceptual—the world “mending in whispers” implies she accepts necessary distances—but the causality is soft: no prior beat shows failure or resistance that this success overcomes. Orientation is waived because floating disorientation pays off thematically; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. One scaffold loop—“fractured hush” repeated with identical cadence—dulls the final image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each imagistic layer (coral/Orion, feather/ley-line, firefly sync) deepens the stake rather than causing plot turns. Orientation is swift; moon-shafts and silt-mural anchor where/when by word 60. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s pulse “synchronizes,” reweighting earlier alienation—rendered on-page with conceptual cost (“belonging no longer a quest”). Minor slack: the AI guardian appears more thematic mirror than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural: pattern of seed-scatter ↔ memory-glass script ↔ vine-grown archways tightens the stake by mounting mirrored images of vanished paths. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“Embrace the scatter…”—with visible image (vines envelop the glass) and undeniable conceptual cost (she accepts permanent transience). Orientation is anchored by 120 words; transitions stay inside the single crystal cave. One minor causality gap: the glass’s requirement of “catalysts” is narrated rather than demonstrated, so the seed-glass fusion feels slightly convenient rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arcade’s mood flips from apathy to laughter, the bishop reclaimed in a Charged Poise that reweights Elias’s quiet authority. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each token drop, spin, and tide-governed light cue layers density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props. Cost is present but diffuse (only the crowd’s boredom is truly endangered), keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the verse fleches skyward, re-weighting exile into authorship with felt cost in the glowing wound. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, dust, ink, stars—taught early and held; orientation anchors within 120 words. One scaffold loop (“obsidian grace” ×4) slightly dulls the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    The textural/accumulative lens holds: the pebble toss → ripple reading → prism glow sequence tightens the thematic stake once. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “weight of illuminated truths” repackages prior imagery with conceptual cost. Yet the Orientation Test dings −0.3: place-time anchor is delayed until after word 120, and the mist/prism geography stays hazy; fortunately the final image still pays off the haze, so no further cap.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ridge conversation crystallizes shared empathy under Charged Poise, reweighting Elias’s private grief into communal wisdom. The causal chain is thin—Lena’s entrance is coincidence, not consequence—but once dialogue begins the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each recalled loss thickens the emotional density until the dawn image reframes the bargain. Cost is felt conceptually rather than practically, satisfying the short-form threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the end; the spiral of shells and glass builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope is not restored but redefined—yet the timeline mechanics remain slightly abstract, blurring the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the negative’s inverted vision reweights the premise, turning legacy from burden to mandate. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each echo and artifact layers pressure until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: borrowed heartbeat → coded lullabies → mirror visions → acceptance of loss. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors now pulse with “a heartbeat, borrowed no more,” reweighting the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s voice fades, the accords now the leaders’ to break—but the causality is soft: the ritual’s binding power is asserted, not tested, so the “unbreakable” claim feels like fiat. Orientation is quick and spatial choreography clean, yet the single scene never narrows options under a because/therefore arc; pressure plateaus after the signatures rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the yolk soaking into salt reweights every prior extractive act with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—because he engineered the drought, the cracks became a legible map; therefore the egg’s release crystallizes his irreversible loss of alibi-proof innocence. Persistent constraint: the approaching storm will erase forensic evidence but not the internal fracture he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal chain holds: desire → approach → untangle → unlock → resonance. Orientation is swift and spatial logic stays clean. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism spill reframes her identity and forecloses courtesan passivity; cost is legible in the instant the snow no longer shields her. The lyric overlay slightly blurs cause/effect immediacy, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lifted stick and whispered vow reconfigure Elias’s future with conceptual cost. Causality, however, is retrospective-summary (“the puppets had reversed agency”) rather than a beat we watch erode his defenses; the decisive turn happens off-stage before the dome scene begins. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pattern of hush, stick, and meteor imagery tightens to final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unfinished lattice and fluttering moth wing crystallize the cost of honoring impermanence; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the grotto’s spatial anchors could be tighter in the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: because she forgives herself she enters the sanctum; because she braids the rope the names resound. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3) and closure lands with audible cost—the voices fill the void she feared. One minor wobble: the rope’s “slot” and lever appear just-in-time, a faint teleport. Overall, a clean Resonant Reconfiguration under auroral light.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    The “because/therefore” spine is tight: seal → dream reading → transcendence. One scene window held; orientation anchored by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: tile find → alignments → charged poise. Orientation anchored by 60-word mark; palace, dusk, regime limbo all legible. Closure is Charged Poise—tile pulses, stars witness, covenant sealed; cost is existential exposure, visible in final line “forever altered.” No causality breaks, one schematic transition cleanly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thorne’s release of resentment is legible in the gesture of returning the box, the sanctuary walls re-stabilizing, and the air’s new lightness. Causal chain—box → memory → release → reality steady—holds without gaps. Cost is felt in Thorne’s tears and Elara’s quiet acceptance of perpetual guardianship. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired sextant now frames infinite worlds, the orchard’s ruin re-cast as foothills. Causal chain—storm loss → sextant find → breath-sync repair—tightens without gaps. Orientation is immediate; time and place crystallize in “twilight frost.” No teleporting props; every shard and breath earns the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quartz eye, mended with ribbon, refracts “persistence of feisty hearts” to a wanderer, reweighting the broken covenant. Causal linkage holds—because Elias persists, the orchard’s accidental sanctuary renews. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (rafters, nave, vine pulley) remain coherent. Cost is legible in his aching body and the decade-long breach.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the blank cameo reweights her mission—yet the cost is only asserted (“courting madness”) rather than felt in-scene. Nonlinear inheritance functions as Accumulative pattern; one tightening beat suffices, but the bathroom epiphany is delivered in retrospective summary, blurring the cause-to-effect linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain holds: traveler’s rupture → lore gap research → guardian renegotiation → vault opens. Yet closure pays with a sprinkle of ash dust, not a felt forfeiture; the “rescue” itself is off-stage, blunting the promised Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: swatch → spoken story → fog parting → memory shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ship lurches back into fog, smile crystallizing that the quest will continue inside the cage. Cost is conceptual—not yet visceral—keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is legible: door → rope → seal → merge → door sealed; orientation clean by word 120; one meaningful tightening when gears stutter; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (lost anomaly). Penalized −0.3 because the diplomat/ghost pact is asserted, not dramatized, blunting the stakes’ final bite.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush unfurls as spectral silence, reweighting the caves’ discord into fragile equilibrium. Causality is tight—each step (stone warming, crack tracing, whispered incantation) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until only stillness remains. The cost is legible: the beings withdraw, but Elara’s ancestral craft is rendered obsolete. No orientation debt; the single scene anchors who/where/when within 120 words and holds the Accumulative/Textural lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam ignites, reweighting every prior coincidence as “threads of meaning.” Causality is situational—coincidence complicates, then crystallizes—but the lens holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor drift: the prism’s reassembly feels slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s vow to “reweave the collective memory” crystallizes stakes and reconfigures her identity; the solid-fog prism and shortening shadows provide unmistakable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: find rag → filter kerosene → ignite fuses → spell “Rise.” Each step tightens the option space until the sky itself answers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the starless void becomes a canvas for one luminous word, and the cost is the spent fuel and the audible hush before cheers. Orientation is swift; the fortress gate and courtyard are anchored within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s indirect foresight reframes Thorne’s transition from chasm to gradual ebbing, with the cicada’s fractured reflection as the charged image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the pause thickens until the single spoken sentence reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the silence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the bottled hush in her pocket re-weights her stance toward Thorne’s world. Orientation is swift—trellis, clouds, inversion hour named within first 100 words. Causal chain is light but intact: inversion → vine-silence bloom → timed sampling → descent with prize. The single structural beat tightens once; no irrelevant shards. Cost is conceptual (imminent confinement) rather than visceral, keeping it below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush itself becomes the earned balm. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights the premise with quiet, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene arc cleanly tracks from orchard breach to throne claim; ruby flake’s coded dissolve provides on-page closure with conceptual cost—human essence re-seeded in machine age.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the companion’s first free breath reweights the entire severance arc. The causal lens holds—each bridge burned is a deliberate surgical act whose cost is paid in the final image. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: scam-scar wariness → curiosity → bolt action → diamond birth. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the farm literally converts pressure into shared gems, cost visible in the vent’s groan and her single talisman diamond. One seamless scene, anchors clear by 60 words; no orientation debt. The turn is singular but decisive; no loops or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: each crank turn and standing-wave beat escalates pressure until the diary delivers the decisive change. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—his birth invalidates the dynasty—earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse stabilizes, fruits crystallize, and Elowen steps into the role of puppeteer-guardian. Causality holds—each pattern traced and fruit aligned tightens the stakes until the decisive unsnapping releases the stabilizing light. The marionette program’s reprise at the end reweights its earlier discovery, proving the pattern was a map, not prop.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain (dust pattern → hidden flap → letter → transcription) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eliza’s stance shifts from passive archivist to active custodian, foreclosing her escape into anonymity. Closure is legible and earned, though the leap from private grief to public act could be more textured.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: lost network → lagoon cue → key → holotapes → Kael. Closure lands as Charged Poise—tapes sealed, dyad re-formed, dawn hint—cost legible in key abandoned to glowing water, future dissemination unwritten but reweighted. One scaffold loop (“plans unraveled” x3) slightly dulls tightening; still, lens stays causal and final image forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each whispered note layers density until the final silence reweights the prophecy’s power. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s Earned Stasis in hush dissolves the coded doom with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; no causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The descent of moonstone-speck leaves is the inciting incident and the final revelation; each shard forces micro-turns that tighten choice, culminating in a charged poise that reconfigures her future.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass rose becomes a tool for embracing chance, not measuring it. Causal chain is tight—each coincidence nudges him toward the greenhouse, the trapdoor, the cavern—until the final image crystallizes the new stance. The cost is felt in the cavern’s tremor and the irreversible step he takes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mosaic Track B earned: five short shards (empty foundry, forge re-lighting, vapor inscription, gold pour, moonlit exit) taught by word 150; transitions legible (“With deliberate slowness…”), closure held under Accumulative lens. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the once-shattered crucible is now weight-shared, remorse transmuted into “luminous acceptance,” cost visible in the tear-steam and the irreversible gold seam. Causality tight: zodiac vapors → audible whisper → name-weight epiphany → tactic shift to seek anew. No orientation debt; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Thorne’s spectral confession transmutes into laughter, reconfiguring unresolved regrets through earned catharsis via Elara’s harp. Causal links hold—early harp setup, tooth amplification, misaligned strings drawing confessions, leading to decisive reintegration. The inferred Causal lens remains intact; no coincidences resolve anything. A luminous ache lingers as unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the strap’s re-purposing reconfigures the quest from flight to deliberate pursuit of mercy’s formula. Causal chain—strap → memory trigger → insight → vow—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting blooms, barriers dissolve, father’s presence reweighted. Causal chain—lens → glyph → whisper—tightens options to a single irreversible act. Orientation anchored by lantern-glow within 120 words. No lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: find barrel → ghosts appear → ledgers reveal embezzlement → barrel used to “unwind” torment → ghosts fade. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias pockets the relic, sealing the cracks and foreclosing further excavation, with conceptual cost (he now carries the buried guilt). Yet the reversal that triggers the choice—learning the fire was arson—is delivered via summary, not dramatized beat, softening the pivot. Drive lens remains causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Causal chain: frost pattern → alcove → vial → uncorking → collapse → timeless stasis, each step tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library freezes into an eternal “captured now,” cost paid in the shattering glass and Elias’s permanent vigil. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scholarly dispute is not solved but rendered irrelevant by a collectively accepted myth, paid for by Elias’s forfeiture of empirical certainty (“sorrow burnished, but never extinguished”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each inscription and veil adds density until the storm’s spectacle re-weights the colony’s origin story. Causality is tight—no prop or timeline jump is unmotivated. Early orientation is swift: Elysium Prime, post-Unveiling, Elias the defunct, all within first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tether reweights the covenant, light returns, and the cost is the risk of universal silence if Elias errs. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each resonance layer tightens stakes. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—GPS failure → slide discovery → carving re-forging alliances—lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the hybrid sculpture visibly reweights the storm’s threat and the slide’s projection, with the turbine-hum as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeating dawn visits, postcard spreads, and glass inspections accrete until the etchings yield a pattern that re-configures meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s tear-blurred glass and resolve to paint carries felt cost because the reader has spent every prior beat inside her hushed attention; the moment crystallizes options without needing a plot twist. Sequence is coherent; no orientation debt or missing props; causality is associative rather than “because/therefore,” fitting the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s revelation crystallizes her purpose and severs the retrocognitive trap. Causality holds; every beat flows from “letters found” to “diary surfaced” to “vow spoken,” with visible cost—her sanity frayed, body soaked, mission reforged.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the wish-granting path and crystallizes a communal blueprint under a charged dawn image. Causal chain holds: because the last wish failed, therefore he renounces the bottle; because memory still holds formulas, therefore revival is conceivable. One shimmer of lens ambiguity in the montage-like middle is quickly re-anchored. Cost is visible—solitude, years of stored knowledge spent—meeting the 9+ quick-test threshold, but the beat is summary-heavy, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy’s cost is felt when Elias realizes the city’s oaths—and his own—will unravel. The causal chain (immersion → awakening → recognition → acceptance) is intact, and the childhood memory is anchored to the present via the wax shaving. Orientation is secure by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex stabilizes, inheritance secured, with a felt conceptual cost—time now “borrowed” anew. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening occurs when seeds draw mists inward, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Situational lens holds: pressure tightens toward zero hour, microclimate anomalies narrow options, and the bell toll crystallizes stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—world pauses, bell speaks, siren silenced. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-trail layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR—Elias’s “stand still” moment—yet the causal bridge from shard to insight is slightly under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the realigned box reweights the covenant, hum returns, ghosts straighten—cost is the now-audible absence he must keep wordless. Accumulative lens holds: each ghost pause adds density until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no因果 breaks. One scaffold (“unspoken words” repeated) slightly dulls the beat, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule’s repair dissolves chronology and Elias’s ledger at once. Causal chain—rediscovery → cipher → reconstruction → timeless surge—remains legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; the emerald silo anchors by line 3. Cost is visible in the final “anchor in the boundless weave.”

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated acts of “tending” tighten the pattern until the string break re-weights the premise—liberation as closure. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no orientation debt. The kite’s escape supplies visible cost under Charged Poise; the feather’s return in the final image confirms Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each added copper coil widens pattern density until the root-wrench reveals the glowing chamber, a resonant reconfiguration that charges “six months” → “twelve.” Cause/effect stays coherent (copper conductance → bark hum → pillar warmth) and closure cost is legible in the final diary note. One minor drift: “architectural secrets” is named before any in-scene evidence, slightly front-loading premise. Otherwise pressure tightens cleanly toward earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s glow reweights the premise, fusing alien and human pasts. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each footprint, statue, and raindrop thickens the pattern until the envoys’ appearance feels inevitable. One transition (door to chamber) is clean. Cost is conceptual yet legible: her skepticism must coexist with wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the jetty narrows to a bridge of fragile greens, undeniable conceptual cost paid in salt-scarred planks and spilled volcanic dust. Causal chain holds—because reef died / therefore birds guide / therefore Elias fertilizes—without gaps or convenient amnesia. One legible shard, continuous scene, orientation anchored by word 80 (“Elias, bearer of shadows…”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural pattern taught early and held to final whistle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the riddle’s answer reweights the leaf from keepsake to coded signal, collapsing distance into permanent estrangement. Causal chain—cylinder → micro-text → riddle → revelation—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by “cracked wasteland” within 30 words.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV coheres; sketch feed links past sky to time-dilated present, causal trail from mourning ritual to glimpse-scene reconfiguration is airtight; dilation haze→mother payoff lands with conceptual repricing under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: corrupted pieces → sky wrong → swap ritual → sky right, each swap tightening stakes through spectral resistance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses his apprentice anonymity and accepts custodial burden, visible in Lirra’s nod. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. Minor slack: the Veil’s rules appear only when needed, so the king-piece vortex feels convenient rather than foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality hinges on Elara’s incantatory walk pattern; each footstep tightens pressure toward the archive’s unbinding. Orientation is anchored by end of first 120 words via dome acoustics’ description. Two-shard arc compresses setup → climax in one seamless motion. Closure (Decisive Change) lands when the spectral cascade rewrote the stakes, cost visible in luminous absence of pawns.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final map of home is “eternally forming,” reconfiguring options without erasing cost. Causal chain holds—stone awakens gift → feather decodes language → inscription seeds reality—each step narrowing possibilities until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the freeze thaws microscopically, reconfiguring Elias’s exile into mentorship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—tapestry map → labyrinth → self-forgiveness → thaw—holds without gaps. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are set by line 3 and never drift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the platinum walls force a single path to absolution. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the refracted chorus drifts toward the spire, a visible reconfiguration that forecloses the elders’ single-beam ritual while forcing Elara to shoulder multiplied truths. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each added voice tightens density and raises her psychic cost—yet the elders’ physical absence keeps the external threat abstract, muting the final constraint’s tangibility. One causal beat away from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exhalation that steadies the workshop crystallizes his stance, the cost is the acid still gnawing the hull, and the causal lens (ritual → meaning → survival) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine holds: vow → cave descent → wrong turn → discovery → painted shell → silent vow renewed. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he renounces public revelation, paying with permanent solitude. The mirror-shard backstory is cleanly cued and paid off in the skylight’s fracture of light.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds: setup (dawn after heat wave), rising action (purified beckoning), closure (gulls wheel, lens adjustment). Orientation is clear by line 3; the causal chain is “because I uncork pure intent, therefore Harlan’s guidance returns as whispered instruction.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts guidance without bodily return, paying the quiet cost of continued solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dead beacon is replaced by a living web of voices, crystallized in the final crescent-lit dial. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each call layers density until the station’s silence is re-weighted. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the occluded eye provides selective truth-telling that forges safety, satisfying causal logic and cost under an inferred situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist/flower imagery tightens until the pinning reconfigures meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. The closure beat—the keeper adopting the boutonnière—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (“witnessed isolation felt shared”). One minor causality gap: how Elias knows the skiff existed is supplied only by memory-fragments, but the lyric contract accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the doorway reframes his life options and the creek-rising deadline supplies felt cost. Causal chain—ants → chip → map → slot → visions—holds, each beat discoverable on page; no teleporting props. Orientation clean by ~80 words. The grandfather-hand note is a convenient late info patch that slightly softens the mid-story motivator, but it does not break linkage. Lens is Causal; because/therefore logic is intact and the final image crystallizes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: dream → defiance → climb → shared breath → sealing. Orientation anchors by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she descends “forever marked,” a conceptual cost that reweights rule-set. Minor slack: the curse’s mechanics are revealed only in the visions, so the final spell feels lightly prepped.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the glowing shell re-weights their shared rule-set under a Hybrid lens (accumulative image + causal infusion). Anchors arrive by line 5; the Orientation Test is waived because late disorientation pays off in the final image. One minor causality bump: “gathered fragments of resolve” is told, not shown, softening the cost ledger a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the birch scroll now “talismanic,” grave-terror reweighted into “wind beneath imagined wings,” cost legible. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of return (grave-soar-scroll) tightens once—but no fresh tightening inside the scene itself keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored screw in her pocket reweights time’s flow, cost felt in its new heft. Accumulative lens holds: each drip, scratch, and polish adds density until the patinaed object reframes her past. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive by line 3, beating the 120-word test. No因果 breaks; the fog’s lift parallels insight without resolving grief too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parchment glows, crystals dissolve, and the platform rocks in approval—cost is visible and felt. Causal chain holds: because she revisits superstition, therefore the runes transmute pain into story. Orientation is immediate; no prop or knowledge teleporting. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and remains coherent to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lingering archive hum and falling timber re-weight the stake with undeniable cost—she leaves with “flawed peace.” Causal chain: perfume spray → induced currents → Theo’s flicker → apology → vision → parting; each step follows, though the current-mechanics are hand-waved. One continuity glitch: the bottle is “pocketed” again at the end yet was never described as retrieved from the floor after the spray. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity at close; accumulation cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the illusions shatter and the cosmos is laid bare, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. The spiral-arbitration pattern is taught early and paid off at the end, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is simple but intact: whistle → alone → key → reverse-count → sun climbs → insight. Orientation is swift and spatially steady; no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“clocks measure the quiet cuts”—with the fjord image reweighting premise, but the only on-page cost is a pin-prick of blood that feels slight against the cosmic claim; hence not quite 8+ territory. Still, the reversal beat is dramatized, not summarized, and no logistical seams show.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward her brother’s ghost shifts via the spore demonstration, costing her lingering guilt. Causal chain holds: intrusion alert → fork choice → Dr. Lorne → laser test → release. Lens is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s shift from decoding to teaching crystallizes the cost of her father’s loss. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each scrawl reweights her stance. Orientation is anchored early; only one transition (subway→library) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s resolve to release her sister crystallizes through the wrong-number loop, cost paid in the severed friendship itself. Causal chain—call, intimacy, deliberate estrangement—holds under a Situational lens. No orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mosaic of twilight memories tightens to a crystallized stand, the closure beat landing under a Causal lens: ink + locket → covenant reborn with visible cost (time, memory weight).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: rumor → ascent → shared rock-touch → reciprocal circle → vanishing; closure lands as Earned Stasis (he forecloses permanence with the note). Orientation clean and single scene window respected.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline pool re-weights her inner map; time exhales, trapping her in responsibility to chart this new territory. Causal chain holds: ring hum → dowse → note-trail → stillpoint absorption; no off-stage fixes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line ~60. Accumulation cap applies only to non-closure beats, none touch the final image. Cost is visible: “quiet blaze” endures—ongoing labor implied.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the edit seals, ink fades, anomaly’s hum becomes cradle—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (fragile nib re-bends, foreclosing further edits). Causal linkage holds: delay-log entry → save brother → lighten her regret, all tethered to the pen’s contingent physics. One minor scaffold: “she recalled the core concept” tells us the rules instead of letting the anomaly teach them, but the final image reweights stakes without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied camera becomes a “vessel for the symphony,” silence re-weighted at visible emotional cost. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each framed silence thickens texture until the fishermen’s hush finalizes the change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: arson → exile → archive → tapestry map → portrait → codex, each step triggering the next. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of Lirael’s charge recasts her original fire from nihilism to custodianship—felt cost is the unspoken knowledge that she must return to a world that will call her criminal. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the “trail of artistic creations” is front-loaded in one long paragraph rather than discovered beat-by-beat, so escalation feels more listed than tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s quiet refusal to surrender the dream forecloses reunion yet preserves the shared memory at palpable cost. Causality is intact—each drumbeat tightens the entanglement until the final hush crystallizes her stance. Orientation is anchored early; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: storm fries nav → Marco bets → Elias deploys gait-skill + coin-hack → hidden panel opens. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: Marco extracted, Elias’s creed vindicated, cost paid in exposed secret hack. Orientation set within 40 words; no teleporting props. Slight causal soft spot: the hack’s storm-powered hydraulics are declared, not foreshadowed, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-pattern on the wall crystallizes Elara’s shift from darkness to reflective light, cost felt in the sigh she releases. Causality is lyrical rather than linear—pattern taught early via mist and mirror, paid off in the final beam. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the synchronized lights crystallize a new communal stance against the elders’ edicts, cost legible in the risk Mira and Elias now share. Causal linkage is tight—each window display follows from Elias’s whispered recruitment and the grotto planning. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift. One clean transition from library to grotto sustains the single-scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she dives, the dock-self literally dissolves with the scrimshaw, and the disappearing island’s re-submergence makes the cost irreversible—all legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens (density of bioluminescence → bone-glow → skin-glow). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the first 90 words and hold; the brief world rule (“after violence became impossible”) is stated, then respected. Causality keeps its because/therefore spine: crate → bone → whale → island → transformation; no prop teleports. The only slack is the island’s sudden appearance with no prior foreshadow except lore, so the tightening feels one beat late rather than foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving curl thickens the pattern of artifice-as-survival until the bird-image reweights the stake—flight carved from stasis. Closure is Charged Poise: the unfinished bird beside the brittle bouquet reconfigures options (she will narrate tomorrow) with undeniable exhaustion as cost. No orientation debt; turbines and farmhouse anchor by line 3. One causal micro-turn—knife slips, curl falls, narration rises—suffices for this length. Persistent constraint (void cannot cry) shapes every tactic; cost is legible in final “remade hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake-merging image crystallizes a new boundary-free world with felt aesthetic cost (ice cracked, cloak drenched). Accumulative lens holds: cadence and image density escalate until the final reconfiguration. One causal gap—no motive shown for why paraphrasing dissolves walls—but the lyric pattern taught early excuses it under poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed’s chord re-weights both men’s creative sight with conceptual cost. Causal chain is present (plant glyphs → consent → joint crafting → reed exchange), yet the critical “barter” beat is narrated as fait accompli rather than dramatized choice, softening agency. Orientation is clean within the word window. Accumulation lens holds, but one tightening only, so entry 8-band is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s last wave reconfigures isolation→connection with conceptual cost—the lens’s new etchings mark irreversible inner change; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, tightening via refracted song layers; one causality seam—how the lens physically “amplifies doubt into melody”—is hand-waved, but it doesn’t rupture the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s smile signals earned stasis, the cost her own grief softened by Lira’s bloom. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the stencil-to-origami chain is coherent but leans on coincidence (Lira’s arrival) rather than tightening choice. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (workshop fire → observatory) is cleanly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: the knock (inciting) → confession → joint mapping → dawn clarity. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft becomes a “nexus of possibility,” the cost is the shared burden of what they now must carry forward. Orientation is immediate; no drift. Lens is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the price is her untainted heart, reweighted when she embraces chaos. Causal chain is thin—why a random dance unlocks knowledge is asserted, not motivated—but the steady unpredictability pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is swift; spatial logic tracks cleanly around the pagoda.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: decades-old footage → shadow drawn → metamorphosis → stabilized bloom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where hope’s silhouette is etched at visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens clear: betrayal → ritual repair → resolved stance. Closure lands via Earned Stasis (“He would report Mira”) tied to tail’s regeneration image; cost is present yet compressed into one final line, slightly thinning impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the opal vision reframes survival from guilt to custodial miracle, cost paid in reopened tears and flowing hourglass. Causal chain—coffee rings → plant cue → tunnel → opal → scar vision—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no lens drift. Persistent constraint: frozen hourglass thaws only after acceptance, tightening the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s vow to unearth the letters reweights the palace from mausoleum to conduit. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift charge the final image. Orientation is swift; the timeline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final step into the forest crystallizes a charged poise—she carries a new canvas inside her, stardust re-ignited—so before/after is legible. Causality is soft: the astrolabe tracing provides ritual window-dressing but no concrete feedback loop that alters options; the crucial beat is simply “rest” whose success feels preordained rather than tested. Accumulative lens holds (density of auroral imagery reweights stakes), yet one might wish a sharper causal pinch to justify the ember’s flare.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (“ash whispered secrets”) and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing dune’s spread reweights the premise, showing cultivation achieved yet the guard still dreamless. Orientation is anchored by 90 words and the lens holds. The single persistent constraint—the frozen clock—shapes tactics throughout and is visibly felt in the final stasis image. Closure beat pays a conceptual cost: renewal blooms, but Elias’s void remains, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure reaches a Charged Poise: the clearing synapse of mind and machine is visually legible, but the cost is purely declarative (“had guided him home”). Translocation sequences are mosaic shards, yet transitions are cued only by “that night / one afternoon,” teaching no pattern until late. Causality is accumulative—each wind-listen adds texture rather than narrowing options—so the lens holds, but the final reweighting is thinner than the lyrical buildup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the star-punch card glows, leash-ghost dissolves, and she returns as guide—visible conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation is swift; indirect-route pattern is taught by 25 % and paid off in final cove image, satisfying Track B.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts silence’s price, bolt in pocket, storm still raging—cost is the foreclosed return of voice. Accumulative lens holds: ochre smudge → bolt → memory cascade → crystallized stance; each repetition intensifies the stake. Orientation clear by line 3; no teleporting props; causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Varak’s dissolution and the resumed constellances visibly reweight cosmic order under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causal chain is thin—readers’ assembly of clues happens off-stage—but the pattern of inscribed messages creates a coherent density shift that pays off in the final projected storm. Orientation is swift and stakes are legible by word 120. Persistent constraint (frozen stars) shapes tactics; cost is cosmic, not personal, which caps intensity yet remains valid for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the atlas overlay re-weights “vanished” into “shifted,” forcing Elara to re-see the ocean’s memory. Causality is intact but thin: the critical insight is triggered by her methodical layering, not by an external complication that narrows options mid-scene. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; the single shard holds. Accumulation lens dominates—pattern of red ink, tap cadence, salt wind—culminating in a cadence shift rather than a because/therefore turn, satisfying the short-form RR requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance inside the stone circle re-weights the rebellion from scattered embers to a networked constellation. Causality is causal-lyric: the hum triggers visions that reframe past failures into future tactics. Orientation is clear by 120 words; the ancient circle’s incongruity is taught early and pays off. Cost is felt in the audible shift from lull to “storms to come.”

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: kite glyph → cavern coordinates → unseal embryo, each beat because/therefore linked. Closure lands a Decisive Change (embryo freed) with conceptual cost—“destiny” now mobile and uncontrolled—legible under the Causal lens. The kite’s appearance is coincidence, yet it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the Situational allowance. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene arc from frozen stillness to integrated hope is cleanly causal. Closure—tucking the photograph as seed, not weight—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation and lens hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: accident → lost muse → flight to lighthouse → discovery of tarot box → untangling as ritual redesign. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mandala of cards and newly bound cord crystallize a before/after in Elias’s stance toward his art. Cost is legible in the lingering ache and the deliberate binding of the cord—an Earned Stasis that forecloses easy redemption. Minor orientation drift in the first 120 words (who/where slightly late) nudges it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single continuous scene anchored by eclipse aftermath; orientation is clear within 120 words. Causal chain: raid → ink pattern → canyon → sorcerer → Elara’s vanishing act, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara trades visible presence for hidden insight, reweighting the premise that time-slowing is a “cosmic mercy.” The drone’s holographic echo and the final veil of ink crystallize stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the upload irrevocably reconfigures the world’s information order. Causal chain is tight—letter appears → internal conflict → upload → networks awaken—each beat tightening stakes. Cost is conceptual and social: the cryogenic elite’s veil is pierced.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the dome stabilizes not by force but by the calm she sows, the scrap-bound rose becoming the charged image of continuity. Causal chain is light (scrap → ritual → crack stabilizes) but coherent under Accumulative lens; orientation and lens hold clean to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: because the garden fractures → Elias casts the zigzag → because the zigzag mirrors the breaks it slips through → the spike hooks silence → the goddess echo surfaces and mends him. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 100 words and hold. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he cradles the captured echo, his fractures mended at visible cost—the garden still, the line still taut—so the path forward is foreclosed without forced exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands—Quill’s hoax exposed, family lie pierced—but the decisive change is delivered in a single line of summarized dialogue, not dramatized. The “proof by contradiction” is conjured mid-scene; no prior beat sets up its rules, so the turn feels engineered rather than earned. Causal lens holds, yet the escalation hinge is invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s Stasis absorbs her guilt, reconfigures meaning, and releases her. The causal chain (letters → firmware → amber) is legible, the inferred Accumulative lens held through a cadence shift that deepens stakes without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—mandala crystallizes silence with undeniable social cost—yet the lens wavers between situational and accumulative; causality is soft (“voices tapered”而非 forced choice). Orientation is secure by 120 words, but escalation beats are more cadence-shift than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s renaming reweights the fire’s legacy from curse to caution, cost felt in the survivors’ hesitant emergence. Causal chain holds: tessera vision → ritual discovery → rename → vines/crowd response. Accumulative lens is taught early and honored; no orientation debt. One beat of convenient off-stage plant growth is forgiven because Elara’s prior agency sets the conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: despair → breach → coin → shared dance → possible mending. Closure is a Charged Poise: possibilities “flickered like fireflies,” re-weighting future options with conceptual cost—the ghost’s hunger sated, her despair deferred but not erased. One soft spot: the tarot coin’s rule-set is exposited, not tested under pressure; it hums but never constrains. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single scene, single transition (hedge → orchard), lens stays Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: shock → somatic idea → geode lens → live-map → renunciation of pills, each beat foreclosing the last. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: they forego telepathy tech and accept the slower labor of body-reading, cost etched in the final rainbow print that now “glows eternal” without chemicals. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the elm fossil reconfigures Elara’s mission from solitary cartographer to herald, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory layer tightens the emotional density toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds: arrival at vault → decoding ritual → decision to share. Causal chain is tight; each button sorted tightens the echo’s clarity, leading to the decisive act. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands with felt cost: she reseals the jar now meant for dispersal, foreclosing her role as guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice carved in snow and the pillbox offered to Marcus visibly foreclose isolation and reopen partnership. Causal linkage holds—return because of betrayal, stay because of shared evidence. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the palimpsest vow is rewritten from servitude to guardianship, signaled by the final ledger line. Causal chain—fog delay → reflection → needle-stitch → crossing—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the thinning fog and the horses’ shared anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the oasis’s secret (sustained compassion = active resistance) reweights the premise with conceptual cost—Elias leaves “with the will to resist his own unraveling,” a Charged Poise. Causal chain is thin—vision gifts insight rather than forcing a decision—but under Accumulative/Textural lens the final thrum recalibrates earlier pattern, satisfying RR. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or logic breaks. Still, the decisive change is internal and un-tested by new action, capping excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the scattering of petals under moonlight reconfigures meaning, trading private anchor for shared growth. Causal chain—petal fall → harbor ritual → new resolve—holds without gaps; cost is the relinquishing of the father’s literal cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage holds: reincarnation memory → sundial activation → spectral flock → flight. One continuous scene; orientation anchored early; closure lands as a Charged Poise of wings above the clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the letter’s discovery reconfigures Elara’s stance from solitary ghost-writer to co-creator, a Charged Poise with conceptual cost—her anonymity forfeited. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each twig/letter adds density until the spiral reweights meaning; no causal chain required. Orientation anchors who/where by line 4 and holds. The sole structural slack: the middle third repeats spiral-as-handwriting twice without fresh pressure, postponing the envelope reveal. Still, the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost under the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because Elara decodes trickster pulses, therefore she counters with sub-sonic doubt, narrowing options for both aliens and campus factions. Closure lands as Decisive Change—signal warps, Harlan’s power play collapses—while sub-sonic cost persists (Harlan staggers, crowds rub temples). Orientation anchors within 120 words (radio station, Orion Arm, power struggle). One hairline slip: the “honest silence” beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the final cost on Elara herself, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: claustrophobia → measured descent → compass-guided divination → organ resonance → seam opens → Keystone claimed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (claustrophobia faced, spatial order reasserted) under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causality holds: ribbon discovery → sketch → insight → tomorrow’s presentation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the cold case with conceptual cost; orientation is clear by 120 words and lens stays Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: nail reveals cipher → proves foresight → reversal granted → nailed to map as talisman. Closure carries cost—she weeps, nail permanently scars the master chart—so Exile is reversed but world still storms. Orientation clean within 120 w; one shard, one transition (dawn response) satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (fluttering wrap, flake’s iridescence, bridge-song notes) tightens the stake until the arch performance crystallizes a Charged Poise—he can now “cross,” foreclosing the safety of “never.” Causality is poetic but legible: vanish → relic → map → arch → play. Orientation anchored by word 50. No teleporting props; flake and scaffold payoff seeded early. Cost is the audible surrender of his lament repertoire—audible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s territorial-marker gambit crystallizes both external threat and inner stance, reweighting the premise from “reclaim routes” to “reclaim self.” Causal chain holds under an accumulative-textural lens; each beat tightens pressure from rivals to investors to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of star-dream echo builds density until the temple inscription reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—observatory hill, midnight, worn chair within 60 words—so no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “words, spoken in vulnerability, decode the soul’s enigmas” revalues her chronicles; cost is implied (she must now expose her own vulnerability) but not yet felt on page, so 9+ gate stays shut. The causal chain is thin—stars are watched, dream is entered, inscription simply appears—but within lyric mode the reconfiguration is legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex calms, the seed is bound, and Elowen’s stance shifts from guarded isolation to quiet vigil. Causal chain holds—failed spell → shattered mirror → seed revealed → unbend enacted—though the note’s exposition slightly dilutes on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV holds; causality through scars feels inevitable; the future-arriving-early rupt is cleanly anchored and leads to a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the card crumbles, destinies swapped, “threads of dusky resolve pulling taut” – cost is the dust itself and the irreversible rewrite. Causal chain holds: card pulse → root inscription → Thorne’s loosening → Elara’s mending. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “catacomb orchard” and phosphor glow. One minor scaffold: “inlaying meaning everywhere” is repeated three times without new causal payload.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Jack pockets the cloth and walks toward the pits, a crystallized image that forecloses trashing the past and reconfigures his next day. Causal linkage holds: the fair humiliation → quarry refuge → cloth beat → resolve to keep sifting stories. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold. Cost is legible—the cloth’s survival means continued ache—but the beat is quiet; no tangible external consequence is risked yet.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine is clear: mentor’s departure → seed discovery → analogical decoding → planting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s hum deepens, the sprout bridges realms, and the cost is the irretrievable absence of the mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the librarian’s ritual of absorption re-weights the premise, turning captured identities into living text. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each smelt adds density until the final image crystallizes the cost of eternal preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pearl’s embedding reframes the cave from bunker to beacon, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the inspector abandons his metric world for an immeasurable one. Causality is thin (why this shell? why does he obey it?), but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is swift and spatial tracking holds.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final wheezed note reweights earlier map-and-river imagery with undeniable emotional cost, satisfying RR. Causal chain is thin—graffiti line functions as coincidence that spurs interior pivot rather than earned reversal—but lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; orientation clear by word 90. One causality hiccup: timetable scrawl is treated as revelatory yet its authorship/motive is untethered, softening the “because.”

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: letter → watch → cipher → coordinates → library. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—library reweights her past “fractured” status and foreshadows second-letter risk. Cyclical-reversal cipher and propagation-delay watch provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Cost (“second letter loomed… trap”) is legible in final sentence; could be sharper on-page but suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dream vs empire is threaded as causal tension; each artifact discussion tightens stakes toward the decisive play. Closure unit—the ice-violin’s song—reconfigures destiny, reweighting the promise with a felt conceptual cost. Lens (Situational) holds cleanly from inciting to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chip’s pulsing light reconfigures the grotto’s future and her own absence with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—each static pattern layers density until the final infusion—so causal turns are unnecessary. Orientation is taught lyrically by ~80 words; no teleporting props. One minor scaffold: “radiant hush” is reused four times, slightly dulling the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens: the hairpin’s reprise crystallises her re-weighted stance; the “scalloped” vine beat shows visible cost. Orientation is clear by line 10; one clean shard, no teleporting props, pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chimes’ resumed song and the mirror filling with dawn re-weight her stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is light—Thorne’s cipher-status means the chime-reading could be swapped—but the pattern is taught early and the final image crystallises options with felt cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse geography is stable. One meaningful tightening suffices at 799 words.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara steps off the platform “stone in hand once more,” reaffirming the dangerous path under “promise” of magnetic grotto. Causal chain—throw stone → read delayed rings → accept vanishing risk—keeps “because/therefore” links clear and frames a before/after stance toward her own exposure to the grotto. One scene, single POV, anchors by 50-word mark; lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught via ripple pattern and holds to final image. Cost is conceptual but legible: irreversible self-experimentation looms.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the arrowhead’s pulse fuses with her own, granting unmoving navigation while foreclosing bodily travel; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the murmuration’s final arrow shape reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—keystone → unstrap → mist-walk → embed—tightens cleanly to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the spire’s light reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; the single transition from spire to ledge is legible and serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias emerges with the color of sound revealed and his lamplighter identity reweighted. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each luminous image layers until the final orb crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible. Cost is legible in the spent key tag and the irrevocable shift in his nightly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: coins → spiral → decision → distillation → alignment → sacrifice. Closure is a decisive change—casting the coins away—that visibly costs her the comfort of divination and reconfigures the enclave’s fate. The lens (Causal) holds from inciting incident to final image. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance shifts from solitary reaper to guardian who reaps fears, the cost legible in the crystal he carries. Causality is accumulative—each echo, cylinder, and shard tightens the emotional vise until the final crystallization feels inevitable. Orientation is immediate; the observatory’s dusk and oculus anchor space and time within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the bell rings, moisture rises, cosmic imbalance visibly shifts. Causal chain—drop-rate pattern → bell repair → sea return—holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by the sapphire viaduct at dawn within 120 words. Cost is legible in the fracture-sealed bell and Elias’s tempered, still-fragile devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The photograph trail is a causal spine that narrows options scene-by-scene and delivers a clean closure unit: the shared toast reframed as sacrifice. Lens holds causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands cleanly: the melt of the crystal and the starling sigil reconfigure Elara’s stance with felt cost. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore advances her toward the decisive change. Orientation is anchored early; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the updated log reweights the colony’s options and the “trust intact” beat carries visible social cost. Causal chain from static clearing → anomaly sighting → revision → transmission is clean and held under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: numbness → ritual merge → clone vivified → feeling restored, each step forcing the next with visible cost (blade activation, containment breach, identity blur). History-rewind chaos is kept off-stage so the single-scene ritual stays coherent; jar’s containment field shatter supplies the decisive physical pivot that externalizes the internal change. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the twin’s first gaze re-weights every prior empty breath of wind. Minor elasticity in “history loops” rule-set is never contradicted on page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of garden/flow imagery layers until the final “revolution” crystallizes options. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—his old rooms are now obsolete—so RR qualifies. Causality is loose between planting and business reinvention, but pattern holds; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vines of silence dissolve under wind-borne lullabies, releasing laughter that re-enters the household. Causality is tight—each pull-cord yank escalates the sonic assault on the thorny grief—until the final misty evaporation marks an irreversible change. Orientation is immediate; the tunnel’s geography and Elias’s purpose are anchored within the first 120 words. Closure carries visible cost: the restored laughter is “a haunting gift,” implying the family must now live with what was unearthed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s acceptance reweights her exile into agency. Causal chain from lost pendant → garden exile → retrieval → integration holds cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; garden and timeline anchor by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as decisive change: the broken staff becomes a living wand, church destiny ruptures, cost etched in the cracked-crystal laugh. Causal chain is clean: iterative approximation → mercury-sapphire drop → quiver → re-forge → insight that vitality needs ruin. Time/place anchor by 40 words; no orientation debt. Lens is causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the living metal may rebel, hinted in “whispered promises,” keeping price alive.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: moonrise, climb, static, shard-glow, visor images accrete until the “shard of hush” re-weights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dish now “harmoniously” tuned—so a before/after is legible, but the cost is conceptual only (she packs up unchanged). No constraint lingers to shape future tactics, muting resonance. Orientation crystal-clear by word 50; causality unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ferry re-emerges, time flows, but Elias keeps the hourglass as a charged token of worlds now entwined. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens (situational pressure + accumulative pattern), yet the cost is more conceptual than felt—no irreversible personal forfeiture. The sideways-clock beat is vivid, but the merge itself is narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Elias “fingers still laced with sinew” crystallizes both options and cost—he has gained the “texture” he sought but lost the gentleness he imagined. Causality holds: every mirror crack is traceable to a prior threading beat under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift—gallery, night, solitary architect by line 3—so no penalty applied. The only drag is a single causality micro-gap: the eruption’s exact trigger (which knot or mirror) is implied rather than pinned, but the pattern teaches that overload is inevitable, so the RR still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of starlight paths etched through water crystallizes the new navigational horizon with felt cost—the melancholy of worlds still apart. Causal chain from discovery to teaching to expedition holds without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the atrium is saved, the dead’s voices remain audible, and Mira’s redevelopment is forestalled—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost to Mira and heritage. Causality holds: each beat (aid → locket → recognition of descendant) follows because/therefore logic. The lens is Causal and intact; only the late arrival of Mira on-page keeps the final choice from feeling fully set-up, shaving the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene anchored by hatch-to-core progression; causality is tight—each beat (hatch, corridor, chamber, console) narrows options. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: codex dissolves, spectral scientists released, Elias exits. Cost is visible in the codex’s luminous loss and his altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the defragmentation completes, Elias stabilizes, and Elara’s heartbeat steadies—felt cost is the blood she spills and the irreversible exile the act confirms. Causal chain (ink → scanner → Elias) is tight and legible under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon becomes a living archive, the language’s death transmuted into eternal resonance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each echo layer births the new symphony—and the flawed diamond’s cost is visible in its dimmed glow. Orientation is immediate; the tunnel’s geography is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene arc holds; the arrowhead and phone form a tight causal spine leading to transformation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—her form and worldview shift on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is legible: shell-spot → music → statue crack → orchard bloom, each beat a because/therefore step. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the statues are “silenced forever,” mechanical order permanently displaced—so lens holds. The −0.4 gap to 8.2 reflects thin causality inside Elara: nothing she gives up or risks on the page can’t be regained; the real price is off-loaded onto the antagonist world.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    One continuous arc from drop to drone liftoff; the smuggling drone act is the hard pivot that narrows options and lands closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—wrong turn → hatch → oasis → fragment → song → rebirth—lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost (the irreversible shattering of his vow of silence), though the hatch discovery feels lightly motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elara’s hyperbolic schematic materializes a hyperbolic garden of stories, reconfiguring her prior search into visible conceptual cost (“the eternal archive”). Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; earlier footnote → silk → geometry → reawakening all feed the final image without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by dawn-photography pattern; closure lands as Charged Poise—palette stills, dream set free with felt absence-cost. Causality: each sunrise capture adds pigment density until the spire image crystallizes the renunciation. No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by 60 words. One micro-turn (plate exposed → print reveals cipher) tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when starlight reweights the trapped idea; causality links Locksmith action to freeing the unity concept with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene descent to the greenhouse is cleanly anchored; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (memories flood back, sealing her to the past). Causal chain is thin—mushroom traced = memory returned—but holds under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands with Decisive Change: Lir exits, shadow slackened; Elara’s backward gait flips forward—felt cost visible in “resilience mentored and returned.” Causal chain holds: exile geometry → tea-map → annotated shard → reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 84; no amnesia or teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices; off-stage council exile is woven into present spell-test without retro-fix.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure—planting the seed and releasing the tapestry of impossible blossoms—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each captured essence intensifies the seed’s glow until the final release. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One smooth transition from discovery to planting suffices for scope.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the hush shatters and spirits settle, but Elara is left holding a dim needle and a peace she must now live inside—cost is legible. Causal chain holds: jealousy → withheld warning → brother’s death → ritual unravelling → release. The “interlaced hush” is taught early as accumulated silence, so the final snap feels inevitable, not coincidental. Orientation is clean by line 5; prism sanctuary, starlight, marble floor, and her kneeling are all anchored before the 120-word fence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chapel door opens to a silence that reconfigures Elias’s stance toward his father’s vanishing. Causal chain—map tear → footage pattern → latch discovery—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by the vault’s rain and the henge’s stones within 120 words. Cost is legible in the “rush of cool, silent air” that replaces speech.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Earhart’s static-washed “letting go” reweights Elias’s private grief under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the ascending submersible image crystallizes before/after with felt cost. Causality is interior but coherent—each artifact (radio, note, globe) accumulates until the final sentence forecloses grasping. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One scaffold loop (“whispering secrets to the indifferent sea…whispered to the absent Mort”) slightly dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffito stroke layers density until the ghost’s release reconfigures the courtyard’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the luminous wisp hovers “gratefully,” reweighting the space and Elowen’s purpose. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. No causal leaps; every beat follows “because/therefore” of artistic encoding.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ten-floor elevator ride is a clean accumulative frame; each floor adds diary texture and the lens holds. Closure is a Charged Poise—diary now “gentle companion”—with conceptual cost: she alone carries Thorne’s joy-pain forward. No orientation drift; causality is pattern not plot, acceptable under lyrical design.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the gondola stabilizes at dawn, internal proof settles “like sediment,” and the sky’s archive is accepted with quiet cost—oxygen-depleted breath and the now-taut spool of memory. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of cloud-emotion cataloguing thickens until the final image reweights emptiness as archive. No orientation debt; transitions clean; one meaningful tightening (oxygen thinning → final gaze) suffices. Could edge higher with a sharper external consequence baked into the image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky-bright mural stays, crews advance, Elara exits—options re-weighted with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—coin → safe → book → new mural method—threads every beat; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3. Drive lens is Causal, held to last line. Only minor slack: demolition timeline announced early but never narrowed (no siren, no second hand), so pressure’s edge stays general rather than razor-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal chain holds: starling murmuration → vague tip → deliberate descent → cipher cracked → tomorrow’s course reset. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the airship’s tilt externalizes the irreversible commitment and foreshadows the volatile aura cost, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure follows causal arc: inciting ache, artefact hunt, hall-of-mirrors escalation, decisive uncapping, synchronous timepiece restart. Closure beats assemble prophecy scraps into Resonant Reconfiguration—timepiece syncing her breath teaches universal repair rhythm. Orientation anchors early (who/where/when by paragraph 3). Minor mosaic drift: library/hall sequence could tighten with one transition.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The messages-on-sidewalk device drives an elegant causal chain; setup, development and payoff gates are cleanly met, so the path to communal effort feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s choice to recalibrate the clock for mercy reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of nested patterns and hush accumulates until the final lullaby reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered. One seamless scene, one transitionless arc.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Solid causal spine: labyrinth escape narrows options (frost clock) → nut blueprint activation → mechanical-bird recalibration → safe passage. Closure unit lands on-page with visible cost (curse loosening, inherited role accepted).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s stance toward the estrangement crystallizes when she pockets the chrysalis and dials. Causal chain holds—foam → polymer insight → phone call—yet the “insight” itself is narrated as a packaged epiphany rather than dramatized in real time, slightly blunting the felt cost. Orientation is met within the first 120 words; one transition (canyon → cabin) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hidden alcove appears as quantified, paroled emptiness, reweighting Elara’s prior wanderings into purposeful stewardship; cost is the spent moonlight and the lifelong search foreclosed. Causal chain—tallying absences → incising slate → released light → alcove revealed—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored in first 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs at the third incision when the orchard physically bends. No telegraphing or amnesia; lens stays Accumulative/Textural and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the last orb dissolves, dream closes, dawn returns—an Earned Stasis with lingering cold as visible price. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted orb tightens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchor (chef, fortress courtyard, post-storm night) appears within 60 words; no penalty. The buried pavilion is a sudden teleport, but the dream-logic taught early (“dream’s haze”) waives the break. One tighten only, but it reweights her palate from haunted to healed, satisfying short-form scope.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: silent clock → restored symbol → first silo breached → multilingual song → rotating talks agreed. Orientation anchor lands at word 60; no drift. Closure is Earned Stasis: the weight returned to pocket marks a path foreclosed (she can’t retreat to solitary tower life) with social cost visible in the dispersing farmers who now expect her at the next silo.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken mirror’s fractured moonlight crystallizes Elias’s new role, the cost being permanent mental helical entanglement. Causality holds—each beat flows from the implant malfunction to the deliberate synaptic rewrite. Orientation is anchored by the rusted crate and canyon walls within 120 words; no teleporting props. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held to the final image, where density and cadence shift reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: doodle → grotto → inversion → seeds; orientation is swift; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she bears seeds whose vigilance price is implied. Still, gravity inversion solves access rather than testing a fresh choice, so cost feels inherited, not personally forged.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene arc anchored by the hedgehog’s uncurling as temporal pivot. Causal chain: hedgehog signal → Elowen kneels → analyzes cracks → strums → sound bridges silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s hush is not broken but reweighted into shared resonance, cost paid in the audible widening of the cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Nexus vigil → correlate silence before moonrise forms a tight causal clock; every beat tightens options, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where covenant’s hidden heart is reclaimed on-page, paying exile’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the diary’s silent grief layers build to a resonant reconfiguration—Elias re-weights his life’s project in the hush before fireworks. Orientation is clear by word 60; causality is loose-middle (lock yields by sympathetic vibration, not strict cause-effect), but pattern is taught early and the final image holds legible conceptual cost (he must now amplify these voices). Closure beats cleanly; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single continuous scene anchored by ~120 words; causality is tight: seed acquired → cultivated → bloom assault → journalize → stance shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stench becomes teacher, serenity redefined as embrace of motion. Cost is legible—“eyes watering, gut knotted”—and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the broken arrow tip is discovered, its history revealed, and Elara’s new custodianship reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is causal-accumulative hybrid; each beat (inversion, inverted rivers, echoes) tightens the lens toward the relic. Orientation is anchored early; no temporal or spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain (wind-tunnel geometry → crash → survey → redesign blueprint) is lucid; closure crystallizes as a Charged Poise where Elias seals the tablet with the patch over his heart, foreclosing rest until lessons are forged. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked statue reweights “wonder” from private obsession to publicly restored marvel, cost visible in the dimming amber sheet. Accumulative lens holds: each bell-layer adds chromatic density until the hush flips to resonance. Causality is metaphoric yet internally coherent—no teleporting props or retro-fixes. The icescape anchors by ~80 words, well inside the safe window.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single, continuous causal lens: driftwood markers → flute trial → insight harvest → closure. One meaningful tightening turns control into acceptance; the before/after change is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: inciting desire to quantify emotion → escalating experiments → decisive collapse of the premise. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts the storm of feeling, the cost legible in the shredded “Equations of the Heart.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain—pendant hum → shepherd’s wonder → Elias’s lighter steps—lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the shepherd “already recounting the encounter to the wind” makes the cost of memory-to-myth transfer legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds; the prism’s shift from passive vessel to active mirror of her own regret lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is Accumulative/Textural, tightening once when frost re-forms into her sister’s face.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber bead’s departure re-weights the orchard silence from despair to charged poise, and the cost (the destroyed tapestry) is felt on the page. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each puzzle-fit tightens the pattern until the single possible act is unweaving. Only the late arrival of the rummage box feels slightly teleporting, but it is seeded amid the orchard’s decay and accepted by the lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each hammer strike therefore awakens subterranean vines that therefore stabilize arches. Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands on-page: frayed silk + anchored arches = visible cost. Orientation is clear by word 60; no debt. One meaningful tightening—strike in the mine—reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the frayed silk, persistent constraint shaping future barters. A micro time dilation (“hours passed”) is tolerated inside lyric beat. Clean causality, no amnesia; misses 9 only because escalation is single-cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single causal thread held: shard acts as nexus → parallel weave → mentor exile → renunciation. Closure achieves conceptual repricing that reweights multiverse stakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clear: storm → lamp out → arrival → discovery of letters → decision to continue the tradition. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: Elias relights the beacon and embeds the sea glass, accepting perpetual guardianship. The cost is felt—he shoulders Harlan’s vanished fate—though the moment could be sharper if the page showed him acknowledging that he may never leave.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: extinguishing the lantern crystallizes his obsolescence and seeds the unnamed girl’s dawn, cost visible in the dimming glass. Accumulative/Textural lens rules—density of light/shadow imagery tightens meaning rather than causal chains—yet the piece teaches its pattern early (laugh-storm, wick-prism) and holds it to the last line. Orientation anchor is late (~160 w) but deliberate disorientation pays off in the final star-sea merger, so waived penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagistic density around the wing reweights stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she decides to “weave this new rhythm,” a legible before/after. Yet causality is thin: the wing experiment does not force a visible forfeiture; the decisive change is rhetorical, not dramatized on stage.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain—finding the sextant, deconstructing it via dream-maps, reassembling it under moonlight—lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s geometry is newly legible and the trees’ witness is re-weighted. Closure is on-page and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawns re-form inside the mica window, reweighting the realm’s fate. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each recovered song thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. A single shard suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is tight: dropped invitation → hide → descend → place → ascend with earned reconfiguration. Occasional wobble in transition logic (how he “ascends” while still in body) nips full precision.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each small act of guerrilla gardening layers texture until the final image of steam and crumbs crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration—her earned stasis inside the tea house—whose cost is the perpetual vigilance against creeping normality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vows re-ignite, the library sighs, Elara’s vigil continues—cost is the ongoing servitude rather than a new forfeiture. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sampling → recalibration → re-luminosity tightens the stake without causal reversal. Orientation is clear by line 30; no teleporting props. The beat sequence is linear and could use one tighter pivot, but coherence survives.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds; the three false starts tighten options until the flare-dousing lands a decisive change. Closure is legible under a causal lens, though the patrol horns verge on external deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass locks inward, reconfiguring Elara’s self-concept with a felt cost—her prior certainty dissolves. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory clue and forest vote beat tightens toward this charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the safe’s opening reweights the premise—memory is no longer a curse but the key to creation. Causal chain holds: recalled numbers → broken lock → pristine sketchbook → first new portrait. The cave’s auroral sorrow crystallizes into a Charged Poise that forecloses exile. No orientation debt; the lens is causal and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she finds map → therefore tunnels → therefore Vault → therefore returns transformed. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (“ready to inscribe these recovered conversations”) that forecloses her former complacency. Orientation is clean within 120 words; transitions are smooth; only minor slack: Kael’s threat is announced rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lingering resonance “etching truths into collective memory” reweights the premise and carries conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and the pattern of rising bell/ice refrains is taught early, but the piece leans on spectacle escalation rather than a protagonist decision to drive the final reconfiguration, muting causal punch.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the miniaturized fears become fuel, not ash, reconfiguring Elias’s relation to memory. Causal linkage holds—each shard burned tightens the next choice—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the blistered chassis and the retained shard.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: locket discovery → neighborhood inquiry → key reveal → mailbox opened, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spilled letters visibly reweight community ties, cost paid in collective tears and elapsed years. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity; only minor slack is the off-stage son who never complicates present action.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: dice rolls → cipher → dance → AI negotiation → sister freed. Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (Liora released) and a felt cost (the lab’s collapse, the dice stilled). The lens holds from inciting incident to final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    The whale’s death triggers a tight causal chain: beach → memory slip → salt-chamber ritual → flower recovery → closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wildflowers re-weight Elias’s grief into active stewardship of the docks. No telegraphing or soft resets mar the arc’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mosaic accumulative/lyric lens holds; tension deepens via each deliberate origami gesture. Causal linkage: silence-mapping → prophecy’s unraveling → closure in folded wing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—quiet final image seals hush with undeniable conceptual cost. Pattern taught in first 80 words, resolution foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara receives the seal and hears the building’s “familiar lullaby,” reweighting all prior teas and lies. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—weekly teas accrete trust until the rooftop moment crystallizes meaning. One clean transition from study to rooftop; no orientation debt. Cost is the shared guardianship and the end of innocence about the building.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent shell and brightening garden reconfigure meaning with legible cost—she forfeits the voices she has housed. Accumulative lens holds: each archived memory adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The causal chain is thin—no beat shows her risking absorption or rejecting an alternative—but the pattern of intensifying echo suffices under Accumulative rules.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “unlink” ritual dissolves internal chains without a physical lock, reconfiguring Elara’s stance toward her past. The causal lens holds throughout—each forgery a because/therefore step toward this absolution—and the cost is legible in the blood-stained thorn left on the altar. No orientation debt; the sanctuary is anchored by the second paragraph. The final image of the key tucked into her cloak crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—her softer, sadder voice is an earned cost—and the Accumulative lens holds: each shell disclosure thickens texture until the final song frays the webs. causality is loose (How does singing literally unweave fate-threads?), but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the snow globe crystallizes one perfect flake, a visual cost that reweights the entire quest. Causality is soft—dream-cameos arrive by aurora refraction rather than because/therefore links—yet the accumulative pattern is taught early and holds through the final image. Orientation is swift and spatially grounded; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain-wet stone, net mesh, matcha swirl) thickens until the firefly convergence reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the folded net and fading lights crystallize the cost of attending to invisible labor. However, causality is loose: the whistle summons fireflies without prior constraint or risk, so the beat feels gifted rather than earned; orientation clean by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: storm lull → orchard → shredded memos → buried device → myth busted. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing—the “cursed” gem reframed as withheld salvation—sealed by the image of her carrying the fragment into the next storm. Cost is present but lightly felt; a hair more body-risk would clinch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shattered portico and silent radio crystallize Elias’s stance—prophet triumphant yet irrevocably alone. Causal chain holds: radio fragments → poetic prophecy → villages realign → pane breaks → dawn breaks. Orientation is anchored early; one transition (past to present rise) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box’s working song crystallizes Elias’s translator dream with tears as felt cost, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural). Causality within the magic system is hand-waved—no prior rule or risk is taught about trapping/live-releasing sound—so the payoff is more cadence than consequence. Orientation is clear by word 60; the single-scene default holds; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: crypt whispers → key retrieval → sonic ritual → ice stilled. Orientation is swift—place, role, threat, and ticking clock are anchored within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the relic secure, marina calmed, key glowing—cost is the perpetual vigilance Elias accepts. The only slack is a single off-stage beat: we’re told the ice “calved unnaturally” but never see/hear the first fracture that triggers urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single continuous scene anchored by the sanctuary overlook; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the group crosses the viaduct, seeds rebellion, and Elara remains to witness the thaw—cost is the solitude of the mapper who cannot yet join. Causal linkage holds: moon paths → patience → timed action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Story loops cleanly through causality: lantern vision → sabotage reveal → liberty decision. Closure lands with a visible (glass shard) and conceptual cost (bureau retaliation).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restarted clockwork heart reweights Elias’s guilt into forward obligation with visible cost (the long drive to the daughter now inevitable). Causal lens holds: because Thorne repairs the heart, therefore Elias’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation is taught later, so no penalty. The single meaningful tightening—the gear catching and the sun-shaft revelation—occurs exactly at the climax; earlier beats accumulate texture rather than narrow options, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly with the bell’s unheard peal reconfiguring the premise; the causal chain from arrow tip to kaleidoscope to algorithm is legible, though the cost is more intellectual than emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Orion-7 breadcrumb trail (recurring numbers → coordinates → patch) forms a clean causal spine; the final archival act lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: shard → mirror visions → orchard intervention → mended peace, each beat narrowing tactics. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses violence with a joint vigil, cost visible in the shard’s retained fracture. One shard, one scene; orientation crystal by 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she hears the ending-sound but chooses service over spectatorship, parasol warm in hand—cost is the foreclosure of her original death-tourism goal. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvage, story, and gust layers until the storm’s “gentle unfurling” reweights stakes. Orientation anchor arrives by line 5; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens is legible: missed bus ⇒ walk ⇒ night vigil ⇒ stranger ⇒ mutual solace. Orientation is swift; no debt. One clear escalation beat is Elena deciding to share the letter fragment—this risks reopening grief and is irreversible within the scene. The climax is Charged Poise: both characters reframe mismatched love, but the pavilion dawn image carries primarily conceptual cost (“heart lighter”) rather than a tangible, vineyard-specific price. Closure lands cleanly though lightly; would publish with minor toughening of payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the consecrated echo now “carried a new timbre,” a reconfiguration legible in the final hush. Causal chain is slender—prophet arrives → echo fading → Elar circles → consecration succeeds—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each clearing thickens ambience and stakes until the pavilion’s hush repitches. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the world is “a fraction wiser,” a social repricing that satisfies the lens. Orientation is complete by line 4; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic of photographs becomes a communal healing artifact, with the vines’ reclamation of the factory mirroring the reclamation of memory. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; each added image tightens the weave until the final image reweights the town’s grief into shared beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s final hum reframes the “last dictionary” from terminus to seed. Causal chain—whisper → echo → decoded pattern—tightens once, foreclosing nostalgia without a spoken epiphany. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene dawn holds. Cost is legible in Elias’s relinquishing of printed certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is cleanly Earned Stasis: the captured hum plus revealed path home foreclose Elias’s circular wandering with a felt, audible price. Lens holds Accumulative—each added driftwood, chalk glyph, and tape hiss thickens the pattern until the final cadence reweights time itself. No causal cheat; even prophecy only teases, never rescues. Slight late orientation wobble when driftwood circle is re-arranged a second time, but fog logic keeps geography forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure hinges on the leaf cue enabling the clock reset, a tidy causal twist, yet the final image doesn't reconfigure the core rule-set or impose unforeseen cost—everything lands a little too symmetrically.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    One continuous scene within the hospice room; causality hinges on Elara’s hymning choices narrowing Elena's options toward reconnection. Blood-work confirmation triggers the inciting beat, and the vinyl reunion culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: mother and daughter clasp the shard, sealing the goodbye with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the Null-Vault revelation reframes the noon-shadow mystery with Conceptual Repricing (balance restoration hinges on her key). Causal chain is intact—key → orrery → hologram → insight—but some hologram mechanics are front-loaded exposition; orientation is strong within the word-limit, and one meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Plot holds under an accumulative-textural lens: the tooth-pattern tightens with each garden beat. Orientation is anchored early; the final image reweights meaning via the dissolving tooth-light, delivering a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the polished glass reweights her life-rule “no fire” into “reflective light,” with conceptual cost—she must now stand exposed among people she once fled. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored glint tightens the pattern until dawn’s first blush crystallizes the new stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words; no penalty. One causality hairline: the storm-fire backstory is told, not shown, slightly softening the “no fire” vow’s origin, but the vow itself governs every beat thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is swift, closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (the pendant’s redefinition). Causal chain is light—more situational than driven—but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of cameo-capture → density rise → seashell talisman charged. Closure is Charged Poise: manuscript sealed, hopes bound, spiral pressed—conceptual cost (he can never again reopen without breaking his own spell). Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Elias the novelist sat…”). No causality breaks; ellipsis between cameos is motif-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration as the golden tapestry drapes the arbor and the villagers recommit to song, cost paid in Elowen’s公开 vulnerability. The Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of song-threads building to cadence shift—holds without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 52; one causal leap (“the loom wasn’t just metal and vine; it was her soul’s extension”) is earned by prior setup, keeping linkage intact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (spirals, flash-illuminated shards, starlight droplets) intensifies until the copper plate reweights grief into geography. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pulsating map crystallizes inside her, foreclosing the option to remain lost. Orientation is swift: crater-orchard, solstice dusk, lone woman within first 60 words. One scaffold intrudes: “moving stillness” is invoked four times, a loop that slightly dulls the final cadence, preventing full 9-point entry.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and holds: each new angle-of-light thickens pattern until the cadence shift at twilight lands the Charged Poise (“the timer whirred faintly…full harvest”). Causality remains coherent—no teleporting props, no retro-fixes—and the closure beat carries undeniable conceptual cost: he bottles awe precisely because the world above is too wounded to receive it now. Orientation is clear within 60 words; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via stone-weights density. Setup (widow’s sorrow) → Development (lamp orientation calcifies) → Payoff (final scale balance) land with cost. No causality breaks; quiet ending reconfigures recursion instead of resolving grand conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens declared and held: crystal memories accrete until the blank is re-weighted as vessel, culminating in Charged Poise as the first chisel stroke lands. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat (“etching peace into the wood one stroke at a time”) carries undeniable conceptual cost: chaos of grief is now committed to a single irreversible shape.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara trades collected fragments for a chance to re-weave her own story, accepting the cost of never reclaiming the lost wheel. Causal chain—abandon wheel → haunt of regret → fragment barter—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught early via the floating lagoon. One micro-transition (ghost’s appearance) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s lights revive, re-weighting the ruin into possibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each airflow tweak is legible—but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the unfinished clock face reweights his life against the forecourt crystals; but an earlier line—“doubt had frozen him then”—is narrated compression rather than dramatized causality, slightly thinning the linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is anchored within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s shift from “mystery to conquer” to “bridge crossed” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is tight—each salvage action tightens the lens on fabricated maps. No orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes when the rope warms and yields its vision, binding knowledge into fulgurite with irreversible cost. Causal chain—rope → decoding → vision → binding—holds without ellipsis. Fog’s recession mirrors the shift from uncertainty to custodianship. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s decision to remain and write Liora’s living obituary reweights absence into presence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (thread, garden, ship) layers until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor drift: the “last ship” beat is summary, not dramatized, softening the causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked egg reweights the entire premise, exposing the hollowness of the mechanical age and forcing Elarion into a charged poise of guardianship. Causality holds—each fragment he gathers is re-seen as vital once the yolk appears. The palace’s tremor and the aviary’s rusted birds foreshadow the final image without telegraphing it. No orientation drift; who/where/when are anchored by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the graft humming under the coin reconfigures both ruin and witness, cost visible in the relinquished talisman. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scar, sand, coin, cloud migration layers until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—wanderer’s arrival—deepens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single coherent pressure arc: breadcrumbs → fountain heart → unstick. Causal linkage tightens options; migration-pause signal works as a temporal frame. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (glass freed, city stirred).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: she delivers the gear, sees cycles hold, and accepts the quiet cost (“the sigh persisting”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—descent of petals and returning pings tighten pattern rather than cause-effect chain—final image reweights premise with conceptual cost. Mid-text lineage flash anchors are cued to present stimuli and tilt stance, meeting BRR. Orientation is clear within 120 words, no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravestone becomes a communal monument, the ribbon’s weave made visible in stone, with the cost of Elias’s prior isolation felt in the hush after Liora fades. Causality holds—each dusk visit tightens the braid of grief until the pattern crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elias descends the tower clutching the relic, the path to confession now irreversible, community trust the visible price. Causal chain is tight—pendulum pause → vision → returned artifact → public act—each because/therefore link narrows his options. Only the very first paragraph delays spatial anchoring past the 120-word soft mark, but the later payoff waives the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tapestry riddle lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image (echoing in the sovereign case) charges the closure beat by re-weighting earlier chess patterns with felt temporal cost. Causality stays intact under an accumulative lens—one deepening is enough—earning a high-band score despite minor setup spill.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill frozen above the ink reweights the prior ignorance-maps with tangible jeopardy; causality holds, yet the story summarizes the decisive simulation rather than dramatizing the final model-tweak that tips stakes, muting cost immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the dust-written score is a Decisive Change that reconfigures Elias from transcriber to co-author, with conceptual cost—he is now complicit in outlawed narrative. Causal chain holds: pirate lyric → dust instruction → inscribed score → future performances. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. A single shard within default scope; one meaningful tightening is sufficient. Meets 9+ quick test on closure with cost, but the escalation beat is narrated rather than shown, keeping it just below the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rocking chair’s halt and the mask’s placement crystallize the vanishing point, dissolving the illusion of perpetual safety. Causal chain—sketch, grind, seal, release—tightens once and forecloses further revision. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift. Cost is legible in the final ash settling across the floor.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each unearthed layer reweights the stake of preserving vs. betraying the old ways. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias buries the cog and etches his defiance on the wall—yet the causal chain from discovery to burial feels slightly compressed, blunting the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: hatred → subtraction → harmony, with each beat tightening options. Closure crystallizes as the braided voices echo, a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses Elias’s solitude; the lingering stillness is the price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the first green tendril reweights the ruined greenhouse into a living archive. Causal chain—prune → plant → tend → invite—tightens under Accumulative lens; each beat adds density until communal meals foreclose sterile corporate food. Cost is legible in the rusted frames now cradling fragile shoots.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s darkness is traced to disoriented bio-bees, a shift that reweights the tower from mythic spire to fragile apiary. Causal chain holds—blackout ➔ riddle ➔ disclosure ➔ ascent—yet the bee-explanation arrives in one expository lump rather than escalating reveals. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cottage's new glow and ajar door reweight the earlier hush with undeniable conceptual cost—Elias's guardianship now has no endpoint. Causal linkage holds; each repositioned object is a because/therefore step that makes the final image legible. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara threads the fracture, equalizes pressure, and accepts nuance—felt cost is the shattering of her former certainty. Causal chain holds from revelation to reciprocal action under a tight causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is airtight: regret → dice ritual → mathematical proof → rupture → grasping the lost texture. Each roll tightens the next hundred steps; the proof’s climax surgically slices the staircase, delivering a decisive change with visible cost—eternal confinement traded for one tactile moment. Orientation is immediate; the lens holds. Closure lands on-page with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each glyph-dream layers proof of kindness remembered, culminating in the charged hush of the final image—an earned stasis. Orientation is clear by 120 words; single-scene frame holds. The causal chain is loose (moon → brush → vision → insight) but coherent under lyric pattern; cost is conceptual—he relinquishes vigilance—yet the city’s response is hearsay, softening the closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ice-lens incident supplies a crisp causal hinge: because the lens accelerates thaw, therefore Elara must catch the molds and descend to act. Closure is earned: before, tools frozen; after, community reviving bread initials under visible, dripping constraint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam now runs counter-clockwise, an undeniable image of conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—reverse-engineering the yoyo awakens the stone—without gaps. The lens (Causal) is taught early and sustains. Only the thinnest taper of off-page consequence keeps it from perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands: the imagined photograph rebounds the curse, dissolving fear—visible cost is the funhouse’s light burst. Causal chain is loose (why does mental imagery trigger the curse?) yet consistent under a dream-logic lens; orientation is secured early and the single shard holds.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene anchored by driftwood circle; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s euphony shifts from restless to serene, the cost legible in Leeward’s lowered mallet and storm-wracked wood. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sound and pattern tightens until the final cadence reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s choice to keep questioning reweights her world after the watchers’ revelation. Causal chain—gate rust → lost expedition → whistle query → answer in foam glyphs—holds cleanly under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: arrival → discovery → recognition of fabrication → deliberate act of correction. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Elias folds the letter, the cost legible in the quiet requiem for “unspoken losses.”

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion’s foundation now carries sealed testimonies, altering Elias’s vocation and the ruin’s symbolic weight. Causal chain is tight—inkwell discovery → note-writing → embedding—each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the tactile act of kneeling in brine to embed the notes, yet the story stops just before the town or Elias must face whatever follows; hence the rewrite feels imminent rather than irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal through-line holds: blackout ➔ stamp discovery ➔ hypothesis reframe ➔ inked seal that commits her to rewriting canon. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—once the spiral glyph is stamped, her scholarly neutrality is drowned with the city. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and paid off when the tilted floor mirrors the tilted narrative. No teleporting props; every object is either on her body or indexed in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the island’s paradoxical spiral and the last crane’s ascent crystallize options—grief can be launched but never deleted—while the missing shadow persists as unpaid cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polished gem and folded crane deepens the pattern until the final image reweights the stake. Causality is intact; no late rules or teleporting props. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“floating island tea garden”) and anchors remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a decisive change: Elias pivots from passive survivor to active hunter, sealing the airlock with the crystal as both talisman and targeting key. The causal chain—geode → simulator → satellite coordinates → launch into vengeance—holds without ellipsis. Cost is legible in the final image: he steps into lethal sky, future uncertain. Lens is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain—journal → chip → drone mapping → decoded gaps → self-mending—holds cleanly; final lever pull etches code with on-page cost (“binding her to the cosmos”). Orientation anchored by 120 w. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; persistent constraint (now tuned to belonging frequency) shapes future. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the watch-hand talisman crystallizes his decision to confess, reweighting the premise—truth now outweighs protection. Causal chain holds: driftwood ritual → watch-hand trigger → vow. Accumulative lens is taught early and held; no orientation debt. Only the final paragraph softens cost to a “fragile peace,” slightly underpaying the stakes built.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the mist lifts, moon ticks past midpoint, Elias’s choice to hand the pull recycles apology into familial wisdom; lens is situational pressure crystallizing stance. One minor causality hiccup—earlier botched exchange is summarized off-page rather than seeded in-scene—mutes the felt cost a notch.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
    <comment>Mist-swirled parapet and wind-bite constrain footing and staging; distances and chained spy track cleanly. Repeating “mist” and generic “storm-worn stone” verge on filler, but the low moon and sea roar directly shape the timing-of-exchange protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass’s failure and the shift from celestial to terrestrial navigation crystallize Elias’s choice to steer by heart, not stars. Causal chain holds—storm trauma → compass useless → utility-pole improvisation → beach reunion—with cost legible in his trembling grip on the brass relic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the baseball’s glow crystallizes a stance shift with felt cost (tears, submerged relics). Causal chain holds—newspaper clues → tunnel → lake → choice—though the time-travel mechanic is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in lupine form—yet the causal chain from fortune to metamorphosis feels slightly telescoped; the orchard’s rules are sensed rather than tested, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the saucer’s essence-mending and the fresh handprint reconfigure her mythic task into maternal return, cost felt in “weight of lost time lightened.” Causal chain—defiance→shatter→ascend→trace→mend—holds without gaps; orientation anchors by line 3. One micro-turn suffices for lyric design; no lens ambiguity. The price is conceptual but legible; persistent constraint (she still must descend and parent) shapes next tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the veil opens, ghosts drift free, Elias’s body literally rises—Earned Stasis with embodied cost. Causal chain (scan → stitch → tear integration → portal) holds; Orientation anchor met within 120 words. One minor loop: “recycled” applied to ship, air, probes in three adjacent sentences, but no closure contact, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the accidental fulfillment of prophecy re-weights Elias’s lifelong destitution into generative myth. Causality under Situational lens holds—coincidence complicates, never resolves—until the final image of villagers arriving crystallizes the cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. One clean transition (trail → ravine) keeps scope tight.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the quill holder’s final turn opens the cradle and ignites visible revolution-sparks, a decisive conceptual repricing that reweights the fort’s role from shield to kindling. Causal chain holds—blackout → archive breach → sundial decode → spiral descent → ignition—each step tightening options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 100 words; no debt applied. One minor slack beat: recruits gather without individual friction, but the final image of shared, silent fire pays off the lens with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a decisive, earned step into the aurora with visible cost—loss of solitude and embrace of unknown reunion—under an accumulative/lyric lens; orientation is swift and pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure lands cleanly: the timer’s bell triggers the decisive act of descent, reconfiguring the vigil into motion; the envelope’s journey is the visible cost that forecloses the safety of exile, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens density toward release.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain holds: the sundial cipher links early curiosity to the rival’s arrival and the final verbal parry, producing a Charged Poise where violence is reframed as shared quest; orientation is anchored within opening beats, no leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: moon → sorting → tin → quotes-on-beams → circle → guard pass-by, each layer adding density rather than forcing causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “garden in gravel” image reweights prior fragments and leaves cost implicit but undeniable. However, orientation wobbles: the library’s physical relation to cellblocks and yard is never anchored, and the “weekly” compression blurs elapsed time. These slips don’t sever the lens but keep the piece below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s hands spin freely, the compasses lock north, and the arbor becomes launchpad rather than refuge—felt cost is the irrevocable loss of stasis. Causal chain (finding reel → building projector → playing encore) is tight under a lyrical-accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (bloom, humming air, shoot under moonlight) thickens until the closing ritual reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the islanders’ circumambulation crystallizes options and stakes with visible communal cost—so the piece satisfies the 9+ quick test. Only the dream-to-waking hand-off drifts a beat longer than the tight 800-word budget needs, slightly diluting the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cerulean stain on the lace crystallizes his apology and forecloses further drifting. Causal chain—compass → lace → salt-dawn reveal—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens, each beat adding density until the color blooms. The final image carries conceptual cost: he must now teach “with lessons born of loss.” One minor causality gap: why the compass suddenly points homeward is asserted, not sourced, but it does not rupture the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "stubbornness lingered inadvertently—he remained... ensuring no signal escaped." Minor escalation dip in lens reformation slightly softens pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s dawn ringing crystallizes their shift from anonymity to alliance with visible cost (escalated drone risks). Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative lens holds as food runs deepen into intergenerational pacts. Missing micro-choice during declaration slightly blurs causality at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: petals weaving into skin shows visible cost; Accumulative lens holds through breath-synchronized projections, but healing resolution lacks sufficient struggle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("forever changed by the texture") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("Elias wandered..."); retrocognitive trap escalation reweights stakes via density increase. Minor orientation timing prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure cost ("syncing with his breath" crystallizes options).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds impeccably: arrow distraction enables escape, scattering keys forces enforcer hesitation. Closure achieves Charged Poise as planting seeds reconfigures division's legacy with conceptual cost ("resilience would bloom from ashes") made undeniable by soil and moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "memories' impact wasn't destruction, but a forge for resilience" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (tears + brine). Orientation anchors by word 20; meta-comment ("wait, that's over—") slightly dilutes closure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost (identity transformation) under Accumulative/Textural lens; vendor's appearance slightly convenient but moonbeam revelation reweights destiny's cost decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: abandoning the forge forecloses safety with felt cost (sparking panels, pooling water). Lens ambiguity early ("Is this about glass or grief?") slightly delays Accumulative/Textural drive, but the melting ice's pressure tightening options by midpoint salvages cohesion. Cost proof solid in "could not remain chained to this ruin."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly when Elara stands at dawn—vulnerability transformed into strength—with visible cost in her shattered/rebuilt identity; seashell speaker feels convenient but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: star's wink-out crystallizes cost ("plunging into true endless night") under Accumulative lens. Orientation strong early, but escalation lacks deepening—silences accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes beyond atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (weight of timelines in violin); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through layered loops; orientation anchors by sentence 2 with icicles/frost establishing who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dawn's light on shared understanding crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("weight of his guarded heart thawing"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through refracted light and evolving doodles without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the vine-mended marble crystallizes the garden's reciprocity with visceral cost ("withering doubt" intertwining with hope). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density intensifies through Elias's ritual repetitions until the final image reweights the Luckometer's irrelevance. The 120-word orientation (maze/Luckometer/2147) anchors cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (nexus flare crystallizes temporal proof with felt cost in the "icy warmth" surge), but cost legibility falters—the surge reads as validation, not sacrifice. Orientation anchors (station/symbiotes) land cleanly by paragraph 2, avoiding penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Elias's resolution carries conceptual cost (program disintegration, silenced truth), with the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through sensory accumulation. Orientation is solid (anchored by line 3), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure builds atmospherically without narrowing options until the climax. The "tearing open" moment reconfigures stakes, though causal links between water damage and code discovery feel underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise: Elara's decision to descend crystallizes options with felt cost ("burden lighten, not erased") under an accumulative/textural lens. The auroral lights' "sorrowful tapestry" reconfigures the station from prison to threshold without resolution, making impermanence undeniable through atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ghost's confession crystallizes Elias's stance with conceptual cost ("truth's heavy measure"). Orientation clear by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory pressure. Minor lens ambiguity early prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens: "peace endured, loosely held" crystallizes acceptance with conceptual cost ("mending weariness of untold drifts"), though causal linkage to swan’s discovery feels slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors delayed past 120 words ("Sage Ridge" appears line 40) triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise works (tears + pocketed curl), but cost proof weakens at eclipse peak where light returns too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "to dream anew in its wake" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost in "void after humanity's last dream." Accumulative lens holds throughout with diary/tapestry discoveries tightening the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Maris' pale reaction crystallizes shifting island dynamics with conceptual cost ("secrets no longer hidden but embraced"). However, the "accidental prophecy" coincidence slightly undermines causal agency; cost proof ("lives transposing in harmony") feels emotionally resonant but conceptually diffuse for elite standards.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost (sweat, lingering weight of guardianship) under Accumulative/Textural lens; "blue-tinged fog" crystallizes reconfigured stakes, though causal linkage to Elias's rhetorical probing remains slightly oblique at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "become the conductor" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("eyelids grew heavy") under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "timelines fusing in a cascade of light" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("her self whole at last"). Orientation clear by word 20; Hybrid lens (causal buildup to accumulative reconfiguration) holds flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—tears as "silent rivers" crystallizing the receding numbness—under Accumulative/Textural lens where density shift (vibrations intensifying to "jolt") reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("solitude as the forge of unyielding honesty"), but the follower's threat lacks visceral legibility. Orientation flawless; lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred early and held through atmospheric escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: kneeling amid crystal shadows with earned realization about "sensory anchors" carries undeniable cost (open grief). Orientation established by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through UV-triggered memory cascade. Holographic projection risks coincidence but justified by greenhouse's alchemical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "rope fall, patterns unresolved" crystallizes the temporal dilemma with conceptual cost ("texture felt in heart's quiet roar"), but the Orientation Test penalty applies—prison escape backstory lacks spatial anchoring, muddying early causality.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation test fails (who/where unclear past 120 words), costing 0.4. Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but cost legibility weakens the final image's conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "affection bloomed without distance—detached no more" crystallizes the irreversible loss of professional armor amid dusk's fading light.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with partnership proposal, but cost remains conceptual ("returns yet to come") rather than visceral; Orientation Test passed cleanly by 120 words with docks/symphony context.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara's dedication grafts her into the community, with the persistent "luminescent ache" providing undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds tightly: her proposal leads to the search, descent, discovery, and integration, with Lir's hesitation at the crater descent narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "journey lingered, unresolved yet complete" crystallizes cost of borrowed time with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through cadence density shift without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the orchard’s "buried optimism" crystallizes Elowen’s reconfigured calculus (loss as expansion, not subtraction), with felt cost in her "lighter heart" acknowledging grief’s persistent weight.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Earned Stasis closure lands with vulnerability cost as Elias kneels with the woman, but outage escalation lacks causal tightness—flickering lights intensify atmosphere yet fail to concretely narrow his options pre-emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "no longer just an observer but a participant" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens with visible cost in her hybrid state. Storm pressure tightens through sensory accumulation without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: brooch exchange crystallizes meaning-with-cost ("Elias finally slept... brush in hand"). Orientation clear by para 1; lens (Accumulative) holds through rain-trail pursuit to convergence. Minor rain-convenience quibble.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but lens ambiguity weakens escalation. Shadows' threat emerges too late without prior causal hints; possession lacks meaningful tightening through Elara's choices. Final image's cost ("forever changed") remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as trumpet's hum ripples "unspoken yearnings" with rain-beaded stones reflecting cost, but "tentative laughter" lacks visceral specificity to make cost unmistakable on final image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Decisive Change (train departure) succeeds under Causal lens, but cost proof fails: "bad habits will shatter" is future-tense speculation, not legible on-page consequence. Orientation anchors early, but closure lacks tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—dawn light crystallizing entangled memories as bridges not chains—with felt cost in Lir’s posture shift and Elara’s tempered skepticism; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("void within her cracked") crystallizes stakes with visible cost; Accumulative escalation via sensory density ("prisms shattering into portals") holds lens; orientation anchored by word 20 ("immortal lounged against walls").

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the equation’s revelation, reweighting Marco’s legacy through undeniable conceptual cost ("trading death for calculated honesty"), though the felt cost of Elena’s rigid thinking dissolving could deepen slightly in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens, with "void below" crystallizing conceptual cost, though the descent’s stakes lack tangible escalation beyond sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost ("void, now textured with borrowed histories"), but orientation debt in the labyrinth's spatial choreography slightly obscures pressure flow during tide transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)

    Closure lands as Charged Poise (Lir's shadow loosening/Elara moving forward) with felt cost, but the "reversible exile" mechanism isn't sufficiently dramatized as active constraint earlier; one tightening suffices for length yet lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (sprouting bridges with mother's restored spirit), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—seed planting faces no concrete obstacles despite abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: secret-sharing forecloses grief's path with felt cost ("peace as lucid as starlit prisms"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where unraveling knots reweights silence's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds through visual density escalation; video comparison creates pattern break that reweights the henge. Closure lands as Charged Poise—door opening releases silent air carrying conceptual cost of irreversible passage.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "flakes settling into stillness"—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; each discovery (radio, note) deepens pressure without causal turns, paying off the "physics of letting go" premise through sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost as ghost emerges, but "driftingly alert" trait fails Orientation Test—promised function undemonstrated when she "stumbles" upon artifact. Lens ambiguity in midpoint weakens accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: each floor’s diary revelation deepens the dominant stake through density increase and cadence shifts, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elara’s transformed stance crystallizes with conceptual cost ("diary clutched close, its secrets now a gentle companion"). Orientation is anchored by line 5; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: "voids weren’t empty; they were archives" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (oxygen deprivation, rewound wholeness). Orientation anchored by word 45; accumulative lens held through atmospheric deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increase via coin-to-safe discovery deepens stakes. Closure as Charged Poise—demolition vibrations vs. completed mural—with conceptual cost (library's physical erasure vs. spiritual endurance) legible in "sky mirrored in wood". Orientation clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the airship's tilt crystallizes options with felt cost in the luminance's "volatile aura" warning, sustaining Accumulative/Textural lens from starlings to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: stalled timepiece whirring to life syncs with her breath, transforming legacy into rhythm guardianship. Cost legible in "weight... transform" with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through refracted light reconfiguring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the bell's peal releases nebula seeds with visible cost (blight recoiling), landing under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by paragraph 1, but the transition from chalk messages to garden discovery lacks causal tightening, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost (tears, extinguished lantern), lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by 112 words; slight vagueness in 'world unraveling' stakes weakens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: birds' shift to harmonious chirps and Elara's lingering reconfigure her role with visible cost in sweat and emotional thaw. Causal lens holds from nut discovery to frost-kissed resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the phone call crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("grief loosening on both ends"). Orientation solid by para 2, but foam-to-insight transition slightly rushed, missing one micro-choice in the deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (moonlight's essence released), but the void-tallying mechanism risks abstraction; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with density increase reweighting "what lacks" as creation's origin.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works (refined memories foreclose haunting), but cost remains abstract—"sturdy yet no longer brittle" tells rather than shows the price paid, failing the cost proof test for 9.0 despite the Accumulative lens holding through the coral pavilion climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis: talks succeed with visible cost (weight "lighter, infused with harmony"), foreclosing isolation. Accumulative lens holds via density increase—multilingual fragments accumulate into shared song—reweighting "bridges" stake. Lens inferred by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—pain is stated but not shown altering Elias's state; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but "quaking tremor" fails to demonstrate irreversible change in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "pockets heavy with seeds" and "fire within burned brighter" crystallize cost (physical/emotional burden) under causal lens; inversion sequence tightens options with gravity shift.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the grove "pulsing with possibility" crystallizes options with felt cost ("profound, shared resonance"), under Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via "symphonically minded" framing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "exile not an end, but a board reset" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (dent as badge), though the Accumulative lens inference slightly delays until 40% mark.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with clasp yielding "in recognition" and tears revealing cost, but the fireworks' intrusion slightly dilutes the silence's final charge without clear escalation pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "knotting her gut" during the bloom transforms into "dancing within" the village's symphony. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; the tide-turning moment tightens pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (guardianship burden), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—gravity inversion functions as backdrop rather than active pressure point narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "silence wasn't emptiness; it was a canvas for precision" crystallizes stakes with palpable cost (the patch's weight, silenced town). Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative lens holds through wind-pattern accumulation without mid-story deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with the statue's emergence, but cost remains conceptual ("capacity to marvel" restored) without tangible loss. Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation, yet stakes lack visceral threat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: canyon hush shifts from "oppressive" to "invitational" with undeniable cost ("iron grip" causing failure). Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening; orientation anchored by 40 words. Minor deduction for slightly mannered "avalanchingly quiet" refrain diluting climax pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"topaz walls pulsing like a heartbeat" crystallizes cost of emotional collision, with lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through vanishing stars payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Thorne becomes "eternal," but the conceptual cost of permanent absence lacks visceral weight. The aurora-shifted final image reconfigures stakes effectively, though "jittery steps lighter now" slightly undermines the earned solemnity of the legacy transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: assumptions shatter when frost reveals sister's face, with felt cost in Elara's tears absorbed by the prism; Accumulative lens holds through pattern shifts in frost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation fails past 120 words (no clear "who/where/when" anchor), capping Q3 at 7.0; closure is a valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the "latent sacrifice" isn't dramatized—unraveling happens mechanically without visible hesitation or tactile struggle to charge the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (frayed silk, confusion yielding), but escalation lacks a meaningful mid-scene deepening—pressure builds linearly without narrowing options until payoff tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands powerfully as Earned Stasis with tangible cost ("cosmic debt pressing through parallels"), but "cyclically spontaneous" functions as descriptive label rather than causal driver, creating one distinct non-closure issue in escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (emotional burden of continuity), but vanished keeper plot hole undermines causality. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though stone spiral setup barely avoids late arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (his fading form), held under Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates via escalating visions that reweight stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-trail refraction deepens iridescent caution with felt cost in "fearing explosion of exposure." Orientation clear by 50 words; closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with cost visible in her step toward the mist.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (sextant healed, trees' visions revealed), with conceptual cost legible in "losses etched in light-years of regret," but the Accumulative/Textural lens wavers slightly as dream-mapping mechanics remain abstract, weakening pressure escalation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation strong (mirror world anchors by para 1), but closure undermined by meta-instructions ("adjust narrative closure"). Cost remains conceptual ("memories aligning") not felt; lens ambiguity in final beats weakens Charged Poise effect despite vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "carrying not isolation, but a quiet revolution" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through midnight's "enlarged tranquility" tightening options, though the janitor's duties callback slightly softens the final image's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: sprouts promise spring while she acknowledges normality’s inevitable return, with cost felt in "forgiveness as delicate as the thawing frost." Accumulative lens holds—the decaying courtyard’s gradual uncloaking tightens pressure. Orientation anchors ("crumbling facades," "frost nipping air") by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with library's "frost sighing in relief," but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; no exact sentence/image where oblivion's price is felt beyond atmospheric relief. Orientation strong ("frozen library above clouds" anchors by word 10), but cost proof test fails per Q2 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when Elara captures the "audible gasp" amid patrol horns—reconfiguring trust's fragility with visible cost—but phonograph detail ("whispered into hidden phonograph") feels tacked-on, momentarily breaking causality in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: compass pointing inward charges final image with felt cost of identity shift. Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric density, though election backdrop feels under-leveraged for pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sketchbook's discovery crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("luminous grief for lost years"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the final image of dancing charcoal fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with spilled letters symbolizing restored connection; cost legible in "tears fell as burdens lifted." Tomas' key revelation slightly strains causality as convenient coincidence rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—sisters ascending with "more webs awaited" reweights freedom's cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density tightening pressure. Cost proof solid in "vulnerability encrypted as strength" but conceptual price slightly oblique at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands cleanly: pocketing wildflowers crystallizes options with visible cost (acknowledged grief). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density in chamber. "Pockets of gravity" concept pays off causally during exhumation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    Orientation perfect (who/where/when anchored by line 3), closure valid Earned Stasis with cost (sweat, sealed wing). But escalation fails: ritual proceeds without meaningful resistance or deepening—brook "responds" but never opposes. Two distinct non-closure issues (-1.5 cap).

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: wax seal imprint under meteors crystallizes Elara's shift from "eerie whispers" to "lullaby of endurance" with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "ghostly resolve etched into her being" crystallizes stance after memory archiving. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (whispers → chorus), though time-pressure from "last star fading" lacks tactical impact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly (diamond reweighted from "cursed" to "misunderstood brilliance"), but cost ("weight of her motivation realized") leans tell-y; orientation anchors within 120 words via "radioactive dust storms" and "liquidation" avoid penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: transformed world with conceptual cost ("shadows would ever truly rest"). Orientation anchors by line 15; Accumulative lens holds through lyrical density shift at shattered pane.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with tears tracing sand paths showing cost; Accumulative lens holds through sound-layering escalation, though survival stakes remain under-tested beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)

    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the cracked lake under moonlight crystallizes the revolution's cost (thawing patience vs. tyranny's freeze) with undeniable conceptual weight under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "vulnerability cracked open; the vulnerability of Clara’s escape fortified his determination." Orientation anchors by word 40, lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the lantern’s memory-triggered reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (regret→action), but "vibrant hush" repetition dilutes causality; cost legibility slightly obscured by lyrical emphasis over tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with bell's unheard resonance, but conceptual cost ("mocking the silence") remains abstract rather than pinpointed. Accumulative lens holds strongly through algorithm's evolution, yet cost proof test fails—no exact image concretizes the price paid. Orientation anchors flawlessly within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "lied once more... corporation's gaze was ever watchful" crystallizes the cost of her choice with undeniable pressure. Drive lens (Causal) holds from anomaly discovery to final archival act, though the corporate threat remains slightly off-page at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "floes shifted one last time" crystallizes mended peace with felt cost (emotional labor in "heart pounding yet steady"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as mirror visions narrow options without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "sound of approaching endings" transforms from obsession to acceptance during storm rescue, reconfiguring her stance with the parasol's warmth as earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (wisdom preserved), but the felt cost lacks visceral anchoring; the prophet's legacy "spark" remains external to Elar's personal stakes at climax.

    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "vines embraced the past" crystallizes the archive’s purpose with felt cost in photos "heavier with purpose," holding the Accumulative lens through lyrical density shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "longing ebbed slightly" after capturing the hum. Minor friction: precognitive flashes verge on convenient but serve density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: probe launch achieves escape velocity but Elias's "luminous fulfillment" carries visceral cost (lost chances to "capture universe's secrets").

Cost proof is undeniable in "heart aching with luminous fulfillment" as the probe fades, reconfiguring his lifelong pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost in "Elena smiled, exhaling into peace," but daughter's unannounced arrival relies on coincidence to resolve the central conflict, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds with cadence shift as orrery activates; Charged Poise closure crystallizes options but conceptual cost ("means to close its greatest loop") feels abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost ("heart once cleft, now whole") under a Hybrid lens (causal ritual + accumulative nostalgia), though the tooth's ritual dissolution slightly over-resolves the physical theft without sufficient emotional forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation test fails: "serpentine grotto" anchor arrives at 152 words, past 120-word threshold, applying -0.4 penalty. Closure as Earned Stasis (vow against fire) holds under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost, but disorientation isn't functional for closure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: pendant resting between them reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3, but cost proof ("thawing icicles" pattern) feels slightly abstract versus tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: seashell pressed between pages crystallizes cost of enduring despair transformed into purpose. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through cameo density without causality breaks. Missing persistent constraint cap.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates to Earned Stasis closure where villagers’ chant rekindles practices with visible cost (emotional reawakening). Minor causality gap in vine tendril’s sentience mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (bottled wonder as emotional vulnerability), but the exact cost image—"locking away his own echoes of loss"—remains abstract without concrete sensory anchor, failing cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in reflection studies.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no exact sentence/image where price is felt beyond atmospheric "reverie thicker than bone." Accumulative lens holds but density increase fails to reweight stakes; gathering burdens deepens without narrowing options or altering tactics under pressure.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ghost's nod reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("weaving regrets into new narrative"). Orientation anchored by 40 words, lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through kinetic stir at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: terminal's reborn lights crystallize options with felt cost of solitude. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly as density of sensory details reweights decay into possibility. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: renunciation of regret forecloses the path of obsession, with visible cost in the "sharp ache" now integrated. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through petrichor/crystal pattern. Meta-comment about word count slightly muddies closure purity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the sundial's absent shadow in darkness crystallizes conceptual cost of truth's elusiveness. Orientation is flawless, but the hindsight epiphany edges toward telling rather than full dramatization.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: rope warming and fulgurite capture crystallize options with visceral cost (tears/snowmelt). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through atmospheric pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "healing's geography lay not in distant lands" crystallizes stance with felt cost (stranded isolation). Accumulative lens holds through density build to thread-fraying moment; orientation anchored by "last ship sailed" within 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: tremors deepen pressure toward Charged Poise closure where the egg's fragility reweights stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "fragility mocked the mechanical world's indomitable grind," but the quakes' escalation feels slightly repetitive without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: coin's "humming softly" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost; cloud migration arrival weakens pressure escalation slightly though lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: memories flood out with "phantom splashes," reviving fountains while her mother’s loss persists—conceptual cost crystallized in "the city stirred, its forgotten heart beating once more under the geese’s distant echo."

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("cycles unbroken, light shared, but the sigh persisting"), and Accumulative lens holds through petal/sonar pattern accumulation; however, escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—the rift vision deepens doubt but doesn't meaningfully constrain her transit choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as the ribbon's weave reveals grief's shape, with conceptual cost in Elias's transformation; however, drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn't solidified until 60% mark, delaying narrative cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: bioluminescent inscriptions reweight penance with felt cost ("tides seemed gentler"). Orientation anchors instantly, yet the ghost’s emergence lacks full causal rooting in prior mechanics, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid" reweights premise with conceptual cost. However, cost remains abstract—no felt consequence in Elias’s actions or garden. Lens inferred early via sensory density, but payoff lacks visceral anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with ink beading at quill tip, yet reflective backstory on academia slightly dilutes present-moment causality despite functional anchoring by paragraph 3.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost in pruning labor, but "synaptic plasticity" mechanism remains abstract, weakening causal proof at climax. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost legibility falters slightly in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: Lira’s ascent toward repair crystallizes options (fix the bees) with felt cost (city remains dark), all under Accumulative/Textural lens. Nectar dusk deepening perfectly reweights the blackout’s meaning through sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation anchors firmly by line 20 (who: Elias, where: spring-swollen bay, when: dusk). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: his realization that houses feel alive through "lived imperfection" forecloses passive noticing with visible cost (the "hushed blaze" transforming vigilance into guardianship). Escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds via density increase (scent, light, object displacement), though one tightening would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cascading revelations deepen stakes through density shifts, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "certainty was the true cage" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (dome collapse imminent).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("fingers brushing phantom warmth"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts. Midpoint ambiguity in lens teaching slightly weakens escalation before rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("saffron quiet peace") under Accumulative lens, but cost proof falters: "insomnia yielding" is stated yet lacks visceral on-page legibility of the years-long struggle paid in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: salvaged molds kneaded into loaves reconfigure loss as fragile revival, with corroded metal and meltwater conveying tangible cost. Accumulative lens holds—thaw progression tightens pressure through sensory accumulation, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure fails cost proof test: "fear dissolved" lacks legible price. Draft revisions ("Wait, that's over—recalibrate") expose causality breaks in the curse-rebound mechanism, undermining Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: the storm’s fury transmuted into "serene crescendo" carries conceptual cost (orchard’s fragility amid endless drift). Orientation anchors by line 3 ("Leeward, the tide prophet, stood at the prow"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density escalation—clouds’ "hesitant notes" coalescing into "fractal refrain" at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("ancient wrath"), but the turtle's sudden movement lacks causal buildup—pressure escalates via pattern language mechanics rather than protagonist choices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy/petal motifs accumulate pressure toward Charged Poise closure where "bare stem" reweights truth’s cost. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; conceptual cost undeniable as Elias carries recaptured truth with "roots to strengthen" resonating. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with mortar-embedding cost, but meta-commentary ("wait, that's over—trimming back") fractures immersion at pivotal moment. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet artifact dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: conceptual cost of rewriting history is felt in "reclaimed stillness" shift, though "dappled resolve" phrasing slightly obscures cost visibility at peak hypothesis shift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fragile peace" crystallizes options with felt cost in "shadows of doubt lingering but no longer binding." Orientation anchors by line 3. Accumulative lens holds, but paradoxical island motion doesn't deepen pressure—missed chance to constrain choices during crane release.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (pools as traps), but escalation lacks one tightening beat. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; orientation clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("fracture in the soul's anchor"), though drone's role borders on convenient resolution under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—vowing to speak forecloses deception’s path with conceptual cost ("time stolen from Eliza") under Accumulative/Textural lens; minor orientation debt in temporal progression slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: drawer pull transfer crystallizes stakes with visible cost (Elias’s vulnerability), and moon-phase synchronization creates causal pressure narrowing options to one decisive exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with compass-talisman and steady stars, but cost legibility falters—Lena's presence softens stakes; orientation anchors firmly within 120 words via kayak launch details.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Elias emerges with "inner light, once jaded, now wondered anew" reconfiguring stakes through felt cost of weeping at victims' faces. Orientation clear by paragraph one; lens inferred early via sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with spice ritual deepening pressure, but cost legibility falters: transformation’s physical/emotional price isn’t dramatized in closure beat ("reluctance clawed" precedes change, not during). Closure (Charged Poise) lacks unmistakable on-page cost evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: saucer's mended glow reweights lost time with visible conceptual cost ("weight... lightened"); Accumulative lens holds through patterned ritual intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tear-fractured light key and ghosts' release reconfigure options with conceptual cost ("shadows recede like mist before dawn"), though emotional cost remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Elias's realization ("gritty silk of change") reconfigures stakes with visible cost (ongoing destitution), but the prophecy coincidence risks resolving rather than complicating pressure; elder's legend appears too late to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "chains fell without a clang" crystallizes conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Causal lens holds through blackout-triggered decoding to spark ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: descent into storm with envelope embodies Earned Stasis ("refusal or endurance that forecloses a path"). Cost is legible in "scar of hope" as conceptual price of hope amid scars.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with felt cost (abandoning violent confrontation), but causality stumbles slightly in the anonymous ally's message—convenience undermines the "hidden overture's" organic emergence during the sundial alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("suspicion heavy in the air") and persistent constraint (guard scrutiny). Coffee tin smuggling creates tangible pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost in "fate caught off guard" and spinning clock hands marking "new rhythm." Minor escalation gap between reel discovery and projector assembly slightly blurs causal linkage under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (sprout glistens amid monsoon threat), cost legible in "had she truly protected... or delayed inevitable flood?" Weakness: dream-to-ritual escalation lacks causal friction—ancestors directly "nod" with minimal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: cerulean shade revelation reweights regret into peace with felt cost ("unspoken apologies take form"); Accumulative lens holds through lace instructions payoff.
