  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    No on-page closure event occurs; the piece is a static meditation on transformation already completed before the narrative window opens. The "after the flood" timeframe places all decisive change in backstory—Elena has already shifted focus, already found her calling. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes theme ("she had found her true calling") rather than allowing image or action to reconfigure meaning. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights stakes; the piece loops thematic assertions without escalation or cost visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the canyon is unanchored spatially and the temporal window ("three weeks ago," "previous night," "now") creates confusion rather than pressure. The closure unit—leaving the canyon with resolve—lacks visible cost; the decision is declared rather than earned through on-page causality. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal (ledger investigation) but delivers summary and thematic statement instead of because/therefore linkage. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at the ending shows a legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks an on-page closure unit with felt cost. Elena "realizes she has succeeded" and leaves the conservatory lighter, but no prior choice, renunciation, or crystallized stance forecloses a path or reweights meaning—only summary assertion replaces scene pressure. The drive lens reads as weakly Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift charges the final image. Orientation is present early, but the Orientation Test penalty is waived; however, the absence of a legible closure effect with cost caps the category.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: the protagonist's name, occupation, and immediate situation are anchored quickly, but the inciting object (lighthouse lens) lacks concrete spatial grounding until after several paragraphs of reflection. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final reconfiguration), but the closure—Elias becomes keeper, lens gives rest—occurs via assembly and manifestation rather than a choice or renunciation with on-page cost. The Conceptual Repricing is asserted ("giving rest a permanent address") but not felt; the final image is told, not shown through a decisive moment that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Elias organizes food distribution under sanctions, and pressure tightens when Mira reports new restrictions. Orientation is adequate—who, where, and timeframe are signaled early. The closure arrives when Elias declares expansion of the midnight runs, but this decision feels preordained rather than a reversal or deepening born of prior friction; no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized on the page. The bell-ringing at the end charges the moment symbolically but does not reweight options or make a before/after legible with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with orientation debt—who Elara is, where she stands, and what she seeks emerges slowly across the first 15% without spatial grounding. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of images and breath leading to reweighted meaning), but the closure effect is told rather than shown: "unused love...stored...in the space between breaths" is assertion, not dramatized reconfiguration. No visible cost appears on the page; the pearl dissolves, faces smile, and Elara feels peace without foreclosing a path or paying a price. The second half (weeks later) shifts to summary mode, recounting reputation and a client's healing rather than delivering a present-tense closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens without anchoring who, where, or when by ~120 words—"hedge maze designer" and "living bridge garden" appear but remain abstract placeholders; apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the halo fragment introduces accumulative imagery (fading photographs, time texture) but no pattern is taught by midpoint, and the ending "disintegrate as she merged" lacks legible cost or a before/after stance shift—neither DC, RR, nor CR lands on the page. Causality is ruptured by the fragment's second appearance ("glinting in the moonlight, though none could say where it had come from") and the garden's unexplained response to Elara's "altered state." No meaningful tightening occurs; scenes loop through similar acts of discovery without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal but linkage is loose: Elara discovers the vault months ago off-page, the piano-key code appears without prior setup, and the arrow's lock-jimmying capacity is never foreshadowed. Closure attempts Decisive Change (escape with seeds) but the cost is minimal—she loses some seeds but gains freedom and immediate success. The demolition crew arrives "early" as convenient pressure rather than earned escalation, and the weeks-later summary tells triumph without on-page friction or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery (shipwrecks, aurora, forge, color-sound synesthesia) builds toward a conceptual repricing when Kael realizes he's captured not just breaking but reforming trust. Orientation anchors adequately by ~100 words (workshop, greenhouse, Kael's gift). One meaningful deepening occurs when he believes he's captured the sound, then discovers its dual nature. Cost is conceptual—knowledge that the device is "too dangerous"—but the price lacks visceral weight or visible forfeiture on the page. The closure reconfigures meaning but the felt stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Lillian, emerald station, golden hour) arrive early. The piece follows a causal chain: track moonbeams → use flower code → steal jar → arrange portraits → revelation. However, the closure—"she realized her destiny wasn't to steal light but to preserve it"—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or action with visible cost. The final beat summarizes insight without demonstrating what path has been foreclosed or what price she pays for this understanding, weakening the closure effect under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece operates in pure summary mode: "abandoned his studio months ago," "had abandoned," "was transforming," "experienced a thawing heart." No causal linkage connects beats—glass is gathered, shaped, and finished without any reversal, complication, or tightening. The final "thus, we thaw" offers a thematic declaration but no on-page decisive change or cost; we never see what option was foreclosed or what stance crystallized. Orientation is present early (control room, spring, glassblower) but causality remains absent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into summary exposition. The Orientation Test fails: we open mid-action with backstory blocking who/where/when anchors until well past 120 words (−0.4). No meaningful on-page reversal occurs; Maya decrypts the cast off-page between paragraphs, then stands to face silhouettes in a static tableau. The "closure" is a declarative stance ("I have truth") with no visible cost, decisive change, or resonant reconfiguration—just thematic assertion. Closure form is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through layered description and the final glow image reweights the oracle's task. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she smiles and the work is "fulfilled" without forfeiting a live option or facing a felt price on the page. The shift from preventing to guiding the night is narrated rather than dramatized, and no prior choice narrows to force that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece frontloads exposition (second chance program, wiped programming, existential processors) that stalls orientation until the violin touch at mid-story. The closure unit—violin dissolving into light, Unit 347 achieving "internal harmonies"—arrives via summary ("The method to amalgamate… required surrendering") rather than dramatized pressure. Cost is asserted ("surrendering to looped timelines") but not shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when anchored, but *what is at stake* and *what the procedure/program entails* remain vague past 25%.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure reads as Earned Stasis—Elara chooses not to use the lens—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page; no prior tactical choice was foreclosed to make the renunciation urgent. The lens is applied as Causal/Accumulative Hybrid, yet escalation between discovery and decision consists largely of reflection rather than narrowing options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within range, but the "after words became unnecessary" premise functions as backdrop rather than constraint that shapes her patrol choices. The "hidden chamber" discovery and same-night decision compress causality without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when by first paragraph). However, no meaningful escalation occurs—Elias performs his morning ritual, walks the maze, anticipates scientists, places a marble, and returns home in a linear sequence without reversal or tightening. The "tomorrow scientists will visit" setup promises conflict but remains off-page; the night-blooming cereus already flowered as predicted, so no stakes are tested. Closure is conceptual assertion ("some connections transcend quantification") without visible cost or on-page decisive change—Elias ends exactly where he began, satisfied but unchanged. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the piece lacks a closure unit with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure ("sideways time" demonstrated), but the cost remains abstract—no decision, renunciation, or visible price alters Aris's options or stance on the page. The lever sequence describes procedural steps without a meaningful turn or deepening that narrows choices or reweights the dominant stake. Closure lacks the felt or conceptual cost required under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (orchestra pit musician in flooded opera house) and follows a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias discovers the program, deciphers its patterns, plays the composition, and completes the ghost's unfinished performance. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the ghost's suspended performance is completed, the liminal space resolved). However, the escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than a tightening of options or a meaningful reversal—Elias never doubts, reconsiders, or faces friction that narrows his path. The cost at closure (program dissolving, peace achieved) is legible but feels more symbolic than viscerally earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, backstory, and metaphysical exposition toward a closure image. However, the decisive change at closure—Elias stepping out to retrieve a "crystallized fragment of meteoric origin"—lands as off-page summary rather than on-page dramatized action with visible cost. The final paragraph tells us what he will discover rather than showing the choice or renunciation with felt consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; pressure remains static across the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Marcus is and why he's in this specific tunnel remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the "some truths... remain unspoken" realization, but no on-page cost is visible—Marcus walks away "lighter," contradicting the weight premise without foreclosing a path or paying a price. The radio confession and valve-wheel visions feel coincidental rather than causally linked to Marcus's choices, and the lens (attempted Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because the ending reverses rather than deepens prior material. No meaningful tightening narrows options before the stated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of observation → notation across two spatial layers (refuge, library pocket). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper witnesses the regenerative silence, records it, and returns to the refuge without succumbing, reaffirming their role. Cost is felt but oblique—the temptation of stasis is mentioned but never dramatized as a live choice that forecloses an alternative. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the silence is discovered, but no reversal or tightening narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear before/after stakes: Lila's silence versus speech. Orientation anchors (Maya, Sage Ridge, morning preparation → eclipse afternoon) arrive cleanly. However, the eclipse functions as a convenient external catalyst rather than an earned pressure point; Maya's tactics (showing pictures, leading Lila to the ridge, handing her the drum) proceed without meaningful resistance or narrowing of options. The closure—Lila speaking and hugging Maya—lands on the page with emotional change, but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what Maya or Lila forfeited or risked to achieve this moment, only the result.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure effect: the historian discovers connections, records them, and smiles, but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs. The final lines offer vague hope ("Perhaps someday…dragons would fly again") without reweighting prior material or making cost undeniable. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when clarifies only after multiple abstract opening lines. The piece operates in summary mode—connections "emerge" and are "realized" off-stage—without a visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece is a twenty-paragraph mosaic of static tableaux with no taught pattern, no legible transitions, and no pressure escalation under any lens. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (lighthouse, writer, fortunes), but no causal linkage or accumulative deepening narrows options or raises cost. The ending declares change ("more people would begin to see") without showing a decisive act, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with felt price. Closure is asserted, not earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with situational dressing: the priest's actions (loop pedal, indigo symbols, rhetorical trap) cause the entity to weaken and dissolve. Closure is a Decisive Change—Sarah is freed—but the cost is invisible; Father Michael simply switches off the pedal and "reflects," with no forfeited option or visible price paid. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague (a "church," "years ago," a "dimensional anchor" undefined until midpoint). The entity's dissolution feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; the "rhetorical trap" is asserted, not dramatized with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.7)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflective fragments and dawn imagery toward a final moment. However, no on-page decisive change or visible cost occurs—he collapses from exhaustion while clutching the shell, and the "mirrored horizon" continues unchanged. The closure reads as a tableau rather than a reconfiguration or repricing with felt consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but causality remains weak: memories and shell-glow do not narrow options or impose tradeoffs, only illustrate the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening lines, avoiding penalty. However, the "fractured timeline" journey unfolds through passive observation ("he watched," "he began to retrace") without a causal choice that narrows options or changes knowledge—Elias moves through visions but makes no decision that alters tactics or outcome. The closure claims he "understood" and "accepted" himself, yet this realization is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; no path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no tactical constraint remains. Under an inferred Causal lens (the piece attempts because/therefore with the tablet→viaduct→timelines), the ending summarizes theme without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt accumulates: who Eleanor is, where the cavern is, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words. The closure—Eleanor teaching via vibrations—is told in summary ("had found a way to teach again") rather than shown in a decisive on-page moment with felt cost. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in intent, but the final image ("continued to spin") offers no reweighting or crystallization of prior pressure. Applied −0.4 for orientation debt; closure lacks on-page cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece operates in summary mode throughout: Elias discovers the tube, reads the message, decides to act—all major beats are recounted rather than dramatized with causality. The closure (releasing the pigeon with his evidence) lacks visible cost; we're told he waits for watchers to retreat but never see the price of this choice or how it forecloses other paths. Orientation is delayed—by line 3 we know "he" is in a courtyard but "Elias Thorne" isn't named until line 2, and the quarantine zone context remains abstract. The drive lens is unclear: causal links are weak (the tube "likely dislodged" conveniently), and accumulative pressure never tightens because each paragraph restates the conspiracy premise without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive adequately, but no closure unit (DC/RR/CR) with legible cost materializes. The poet begins seeking answers, arranges rope in a pattern, and ends having "discovered" something—but no before/after change in options, stance, or knowledge occurs on the page with felt price. The piece reads as a single static tableau of contemplation rather than a pressure curve that tightens or reconfigures meaning. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story opens with chronic hush after the rainforest burned, but causality remains murky: we never learn how Kael's acoustically perceptive nature emerged, why the greenhouse and shipwrecks survived, or what specific constraints the hush imposes on daily survival. The central event—Kael plays violin, family storytelling tradition validates his art—unfolds without a meaningful reversal or tightening; the "chronic hush was not an absence of sound but a different kind of music" realization is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration in theory (Kael understands his purpose), but the cost is conceptual-only and not legible on the page: no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no tactical shift forced by the performance. Orientation is established early (who/where/when), so no penalty there, but the accumulative lens struggles because the final image doesn't reweight prior particulars—it merely restates the premise with tears and a shoulder-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is anchored adequately (who, where, when), but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—Elias executes a routine procedure with zero complication, choice, or reversal. The "transformation" is narrated as complete from the opening and merely observed through to the end, offering no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The piece reads as a single extended exposition of Elias's worldview rather than a scene in which pressure forces a stance crystallization or forecloses a path. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density increase reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing via "cycles of compassion," but closure arrives as narrator summary ("thus the cycle continued") rather than a dramatized image with visible cost. The misdelivered envelope setup is paid off once with Eleanor, then the "years later" paragraph telescopes a second cycle into exposition without dramatizing the mechanics or stakes. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is addressing and where Eleanor is positioned remain vague until after their exchange begins. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) wobbles between business calculus and theme assertion, never fully crystallizing a pattern through repeated on-page beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara's isolation → collaborative search → discovery of ancestral sigil → collective dedication. Orientation anchors early (marsh-reeds, crater, orchard). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the group etches the sigil together, reweighting isolation into belonging. Cost is implied through "unshed tears" and the renunciation of solitary identity, but the final image prioritizes communal affirmation over a visceral, on-page price that forecloses a specific prior option. One meaningful deepening is present, satisfying length requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is unclear past 120 words: the "rooftop canal system," "giant," and "place where echoes are born" remain abstract without spatial or causal grounding, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads as attempted Causal but causality is undercut by convenience: the pendant glows and grants exactly the power needed at each beat without constraint. The closure—cage shattering and rhythm restoration—occurs on the page, but cost is told ("his future now shortened") rather than shown through a specific forfeited moment or image. The "interrupted cadence" motivates the quest but its mechanics (how water pulses unnaturally, why it matters beyond declaration) are never dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The piece operates in a single continuous scene with one POV and follows a ritual structure, but the closure unit is weak: Elara sees a vision, the stone rearranges, and she packs away the eyes with renewed purpose—no decisive change, felt cost, or true reconfiguration occurs on the page. The vision fades "as quickly as it had appeared," undercutting any stake shift. Under a Causal lens, the final paragraph asserts forward momentum ("closer than ever to solving it") without dramatizing what has been foreclosed or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges piecemeal across the first 200+ words, creating drift (−0.4 penalty; Q3 capped at 7.0). The tape fragment discovery occurs past midpoint and the ending describes future intention rather than delivering on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The stated plan to place the fragment "through a series of small interventions" is told, not dramatized, leaving closure unclear. Drive lens reads hybrid-accumulative but never crystallizes into a legible before/after with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (Elara, nursery, post-storm), clearing the test. The accumulative lens is taught early and holds—storm cycles deepen the control-versus-nature tension—but closure cost is abstract: "transformation complete" tells the change rather than landing a decisive image or forfeited path on the page. The ending summarizes outcome ("most verdant," "surprising everyone") instead of crystallizing a final choice or renunciation with felt price. One meaningful deepening occurs (vents-open gambit), meeting minimum escalation, but the resolution dilutes into reflective summary rather than a charged final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (insomniac painter, tidal island, post-water-wars) land by ~80 words. The exchange forms a clear before/after unit: Lena relinquishes the brooch-as-talisman and gains pigments that redefine her purpose. Cost is visible (the amber warmth "imprinted on her palm"), and the ending sleep shift constitutes Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. Minor slip: "Her gallery" in the visitor passage implies a time jump without transition anchoring, briefly clouding causality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear orientation (clairvoyant in crystal cave, pilgrim arrives). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from passive seer to active participant—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the final paragraph tells us she "stood at the threshold of her greatest revelation" without dramatizing what she forecloses or sacrifices. The pearl activates shadows, but causality is loose: "unseen forces had begun to gather" appears without prior setup, and the pilgrim's purpose is revealed retroactively through Elara's realization rather than through causal linkage on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when shadows detach and Elara grasps the pearl's function, but the ending layers thematic claims rather than tightening options or showing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: fragments compile across staggered intervals toward a communal healing. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the harbor shifts from absences to presence), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page moment where a specific price is legible. The final paragraph restates theme rather than reweighting prior material through a charged image, weakening the closure's felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first few paragraphs, so orientation debt does not apply. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Ethan emerges "changed" and smiling, armed with knowledge, but no visible price is paid—he loses no capability, relationship, or prior identity trait in a legible way. The narrative summarizes his future ("each evening… he would return") rather than dramatizing a decisive change or renunciation. Under a Causal lens (the piece attempts because/therefore linkage: finding the box → entering the vault → understanding his purpose), the final turn is asserted rather than earned by a choice that narrows options. The ending reads as a mission statement, not a felt transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors are delayed and vague; we learn "stargazer's open tower" and "whale migration" in the opening, but physical grounding remains abstract throughout. The drive lens is ambiguous—textural repetition suggests Accumulative, yet the ending attempts Decisive Change without causal linkage or visible cost on the page. The transformation from solitary keeper to sanctuary host is summarized in a single sentence ("Elara began inviting others") with no on-page turn, choice under pressure, or dramatized consequence. The closure paragraph recaps thematic claims rather than landing a felt reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The Drive Lens reads Causal but collapses under scrutiny: Alistair's decision to reunite fragments is declared, not earned through because/therefore pressure. The closure unit—"what came after goodbye was not an end but a continuation"—delivers Conceptual Repricing via stated theme rather than image or cost. The portal step and escondite collapse happen, but no visible price alters options on the page; the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Maya, prep room, night of the heist) by the first paragraphs. The causal chain is legible: observation → duplication → breach → forgery → delivery, though the escalation is mechanical rather than pressured. Closure delivers a decisive change (documents forged, Dr. Thorne saved) with cost acknowledged ("breach the trust of her employer"), but the price feels declared rather than viscerally paid on the page. The lens is causal-dominant, held consistently, but the final image of the ink pot "reflecting possibility" softens into abstraction when concrete consequence would sharpen it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost: Elias completes his routine exactly as described at the outset, applies gold leaf, and continues—no tightening, no reversal, no foreclosed option. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive clearly, but "when the town below had fallen silent" remains vague (permanent abandonment? nightly silence?) past the 120-word threshold without disambiguation or payoff, triggering −0.3. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final image ("continued his work") reaffirms stasis without visible cost or reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    **Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first few lines, so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The piece accumulates reflective layers but delivers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost at closure. The final lines ("I have found my purpose not in what was lost but in what remains") restate the opening stance without reweighting options or imposing felt consequences. No on-page closure unit is present.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into thematic summary. Closure lacks visible cost: Evelyn walks away with "newfound appreciation" but no path foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized on the page. The cello-memory mechanism introduces a supernatural solve without prior constraint or friction. Orientation is clear early, but the because/therefore chain dissolves into expository recounting of the astronomers' debate rather than pressing Evelyn's present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is Causal but the closure lacks felt cost. Maya's final acts (returning the stone, removing the earpiece) are declarative gestures rather than choices that foreclose options—the "dual allegiance resolved" is asserted, not dramatized through sacrifice or irreversible consequence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first sentence, avoiding penalty. The three-night mapping montage and the favorable terms arrival constitute summary telling that flattens the central pressure arc; the story lists outcomes rather than dramatizing the turn that earns them.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors appear early (moonlit summit, crater inspector, lunar surface), satisfying the basic test. The inferred lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elena waits, the fireflies appear, she photographs them, they vanish. However, the closure lacks felt cost—she completes her mission exactly as planned with no complication, reversal, or deepening that reweights prior material. The "dawnlit melancholy" and sense of purpose are asserted in summary rather than earned through on-page pressure. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; the ending simply reports satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The piece traces a single repair job from inbox to completion, accumulating atmospheric texture toward a quiet finish, but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the drone is broken, then fixed, with no complication that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (thematic reweighting of connection across distance), yet the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. Under an Accumulative lens the density is modest; under Causal the repair proceeds without obstacle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: condensation patterns recur and the coordinates confirm prior suspicion, building toward the singular convergence discovery. Orientation anchors clearly (outpost, frozen lake, Elmsley). The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—Elmsley realizes humanity's need to seek origins—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page forfeiture or altered tactic is visible. The midpoint confirmation ("coordinates that merely confirmed what he already suspected") flattens pressure rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Silas walks methodically, the town repairs incrementally, and the final sustained note delivers closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. However, the cost remains conceptual and vague—what did Silas forfeit or risk to achieve this restoration? The "threat of collapse receded" and "hours bled into one another" tell us pressure existed, but no on-page moment shows a tightening that narrows options or forces a visible price. The closure image reweights the town's state but lacks the felt or visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. The piece establishes who/where/when early enough. The closure attempt—Elena caps the vial, ascends, and is rescued—lands on the page, but cost is absent: she succeeds completely, the rescue arrives on cue, and she's already planning a return trip. The final image shows triumph without trade-off, undercutting the oxygen-depletion stakes. The vial-in-depression mechanism feels convenient; no prior setup shows why this object fits this lock or how Elena inferred the match.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words—"the son" is never named, the prison's physical layout unclear, and temporal markers absent. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative textures suggest lyric mode, but no taught pattern emerges by midpoint). No on-page closure unit: the ending declares he "found his voice" and "threaded the labyrinth" but provides no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing—only summary of off-page transformation. "Before they find the bodies" repeats without causal development or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly across the first 25% without clear present-scene framing, and the disorientation does not pay off at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—bead crumbles, bride fades, bloom appears—occurs entirely off-stage (morning discovery by groundskeeper); no decisive change, stance crystallization, or felt cost lands on the page. The dominant lens is ambiguous (lyric accumulation vs. causal wish-fulfillment) and unearned; the ending substitutes symbolic satisfaction for dramatized pressure. Backstory comprises ~40% of the text but never anchors in a present choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph (passing Orientation Test). However, causality is loose: the plate "spoke to her in dreams" and her sleepwalking "overlaps" with canyon paths without clear mechanism or cost. The ending offers no decisive change—Elara "continued her work" in perpetuity, and the orchids bloom without consequence or foreclosed option. The accumulative design gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but delivers summary ("testament to the power of art") rather than a charged final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative lens: Kaelen's gradual reconnection through excavation work builds toward the sundial's completion and his stated spiritual restoration. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (restoration of faith and completion of journey), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with felt price. The orientation is clear early (returnee, catacomb orchard, excavation), and the lens holds, but the final image lacks the sharp before/after that makes cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and cleanly. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: dawn ritual → chalk patterns → letter delivery forms a thematic gradient rather than causal escalation. However, closure lacks felt cost; the final image ("smiled, embracing the future") asserts satisfaction without an on-page reversal, renunciation, or reweighting that changes Elara's options or stance. The shift from "simple transaction" to "transformed herself" is told retrospectively rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights Elara's work from decorative to tactically decisive—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors (cobalt observatory, autumn, Elara at her workspace) land cleanly by ~80 words. The escalation operates through density increase (whispers → alignment revelation → synchronized pattern → coded sabotage), satisfying the accumulative lens, but the ending summarizes outcomes ("The coup would fail") rather than showing a decisive image where pressure crystallizes. One meaningful deepening is present but closure impact is dulled by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (shard → warmth → condensation messages) but escalation is shallow; each revelation arrives without narrowing options or raising cost. Orientation is clear by the opening. The closure unit—"I forgive"—lands as a Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the forgiveness viscerally expensive. The repeated condensation messages feel iterative rather than causally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered reflection and the coral's recurring presence. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: "sometimes the dead never leave us but simply change form, just like meaning changes with translation" reweights the premise, and the final gesture (closing Lina's fingers around the coral) crystallizes the ritual. Cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible—Kaelen accepts the weight of translating grief—but the image remains somewhat abstract. The piece teaches its reflective, mosaic pattern early and holds it, but the ending lingers in summary ("His work was done for tonight") rather than a single charged image, slightly softening the closure's punch.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation arrives late: who/where/when are not anchored until multiple paragraphs in, and "fog-choked ruins" + "centuries had passed" + "daydreams" create deliberate disorientation that is never taught as a pattern or paid off at closure (−0.4). The piece follows a causal lens but linkage is weak: Amelia's discovery of the fragment, her light-therapy revelation, and the community's transformation proceed without meaningful tightening or a decision that forecloses a path. The closure—community joy rekindled—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, failing the Cost Proof Test (−0.6). The drive lens wobbles between causal and thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly and remain stable. However, the numbered awakenings function as a catalogue rather than causal linkage; each is announced rather than earned through scene pressure. The closure—Elena placing the nickel back—offers mild Resonant Reconfiguration (she will work differently), but the cost is conceptual-only and the decisive moment lacks on-page friction or trade-off. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the "five awakenings" structure imposes artificial segmentation that undercuts organic density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation arrives piecemeal across many paragraphs (surveillance monitors, five years ago, Thought Tax increments, club structure, garden plots) without anchoring who/where/when by ~120 words; no single scene window emerges. The lens reads Situational-accumulative but never crystallizes: the "final phase" and "nationwide resistance" are declared in the penultimate lines without on-page causal linkage or visible cost—what changes for Kaelen? The closing "moment of pure, untaxed thought" is asserted feeling, not a reweighted image with legible consequence. No decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing lands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are unclear past 120 words; the "gargantuan shell" and "sleeping world" anchor setting vaguely, and the poet's actual situation (alone? tending others? inside a literal shell?) remains ambiguous well into the piece. No meaningful escalation or causal tightening occurs—centuries pass, blossoms spread, the poet dies, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice. The closure (poet dies, lullabies continue) offers atmospheric continuity but no decisive change, felt cost, or reweighted meaning; it reads as descriptive summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break recharges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery → restoration → reintegration, with the final chime chorus offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tube's voice restored and names preserved "for perhaps another day"). However, cost remains conceptual and oblique—"foxglove regret" and the threat of future fading are told, not shown as a visible price paid in this window. The restoration succeeds without setback, and the because/therefore linkage is thin; light heals because a song resonates, but the mechanics feel convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who (Elena), where (archive), and what (translate to prevent division) within the first paragraph. However, the entire middle is a single extended work session without meaningful reversal or tightening—she searches, finds patterns, and discovers the key text in linear accumulation. The ending gesture (walking toward leaders) occurs off-page, so no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing lands with visible cost on the page. Closure remains prospective rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough, so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The closure—Elara walks toward the entrance with her solution—reads as summary rather than on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the "encrypted compassion" discovery and seasonal-lake design are recounted discoveries, not dramatized reversals that narrow options. The lens drifts between accumulative (breathing building, layered images) and causal (adhesive analysis leads to insight), never teaching or holding a pattern through closure. No visible cost forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elara reclaims her identity and releases the first pigeon. The orientation window extends past 120 words (attic location arrives early, but "who" clarifies slowly through backstory). Cost is present but muted: she signs a new name and sends a bird, but what she forfeits on the page remains abstract. The meteorite functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a constraint that narrows options, and the weeks-long compression flattens escalation into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (Elara), where (drifting prism terrace), and when (post-butterfly-effect) arrive early enough, so no penalty applied here. However, causality is vague: thresholds "become thinner," objects "manifest briefly," but no because/therefore chain drives choices—Elara wanders until a door appears and her father is simply there. The closure (reunion) lacks visible cost or forfeiture; the "necessary distances" collapse without trade-off. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density increase charges the ending—just assertion of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words, waiving that penalty. However, the plot follows an and-then structure: Maya descends, finds a feather, follows it, discovers creatures, watches them form a constellation, then ascends with a transformed feather. No meaningful reversal tightens options; the feather's pull is convenient rather than earned, and the transformation at sunrise solves a problem the feather did not help create. The closure lacks visible cost—Maya gains a map and understanding without forfeiting anything on the page. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story teaches a reflective-accumulative pattern early (polishing glass, seeking understanding) but the closure arrives via convenient wisdom from migrating-bird seeds rather than protagonist agency. The revelatory turn—"disappearance was not loss, but metamorphosis"—is told as sudden insight without prior causal pressure narrowing options. Orientation is clear (who, where, when by the opening paragraphs). Cost is asserted ("Before memory fades entirely") but never materially tested; the protagonist faces no trade-off, only confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is established early. The piece attempts a Causal frame—Leo observes, selects, drops the piece, the woman responds—but the linkage depends on unmotivated omniscience: Leo knows her anniversary, her opera, her need, all without dramatized inference. The closure is a stated success ("he had succeeded once more") rather than a visible change in Leo's options or knowledge. No cost appears; the woman walks away transformed, Leo rests satisfied, and the cycle promises to repeat identically. The ending summarizes rather than enacting a turn, failing the on-page cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece opens with orientation anchors (Lira, twilight garden, post-nostalgia-ban) within the first 120 words, satisfying the Orientation Test. A Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into living manuscript) occurs on the page, but the causal linkage dissolves into coincidence: the moonstone speck appears without prior setup, triggers anchoring "unexpected but not unwelcome," and dissolves having "fulfilled its purpose" with no cost dramatized. Under a hybrid lens leaning accumulative, the closure reweights her exile from punishment to "sacred choice," yet the price—loss of mobility, agency, or connection—remains asserted rather than felt in the final image. The inferred lens holds, but cost legibility fails the proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader learns Mara is a glazier only after abstract reverie, and the triggering "inexplicable force" lacks causal grounding. The story offers no decisive change or visible cost—Mara returns to her workshop with new intention, but nothing on the page has been foreclosed or sacrificed. The ending restates the premise ("being a harbor glazier was never about the destination") without a before/after that makes cost legible. The dominant lens is ambiguous between lyric accumulation and causal choice, and the ending satisfies neither cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—extended reflection and recurring porcelain-box imagery build toward a reweighted stance. Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the box shifts from "accusation" to "companion"), but the cost is asserted ("hard-won, gentle wisdom") rather than dramatically legible; no specific option is foreclosed or tactic altered in the final beat. The piece teaches its reflective mode early, yet the ending reconfiguration lacks undeniable pressure—peace is declared, not earned through a visible renunciation or choice that changes what comes next.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure with felt cost. The needle pointing at Elian and his realization that "patterns had become conduits" reads as declarative summary rather than a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible. No option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page—only abstract affirmation ("had succeeded in revitalizing") and vague possibility ("infinite possibilities that awaited"). The causal lens is undermined by magical outcomes (gauge spinning, "trial balloons" succeeding) without earned mechanics or trade-offs. Orientation is delayed but eventually provided; no major penalty applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal chain (passage → chamber → diaries → negative → lab development → realization) with motivated progression. However, the closure unit—Elara's understanding and commitment—lacks on-page cost; she simply "realized" and "committed" without forfeiting a tangible option or enduring visible friction. The film's revelation arrives cleanly but doesn't narrow her choices or impose a felt price in the final image. One meaningful tightening (discovery of Thorne's work) occurs, but the ending restates theme rather than landing a decisive change or reconfiguration with demonstrable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and establishes the ritual pattern, but closure lacks decisive reweighting with felt cost—the mirrors show possibilities, she murmurs "Wonderful," then departs until spring with only "familiar melancholy." The separation from the terrace's heartbeat is told, not dramatized as a foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening narrows options or changes knowledge in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (negotiator, terrace, midsummer) and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the day's progression, celestial alignment, and treaty completion. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the clipboard gesture and the child's laughter, reweighting war/peace tension. However, cost remains abstract and largely asserted ("price of redemption," "debt carried forward") rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or action that narrows Elian's options. The piece teaches its contemplative pattern by midpoint and holds it through the ending, but the final image does not point to an exact on-page sentence where cost is unmistakably legible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative lens: Silas walks across the salt flat, places the egg, rain begins, he departs transformed. Orientation anchors quickly (Silas, salt flat, egg in hand). The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he preserves hope through symbolic release—but the cost remains abstract and stated rather than felt: "something had shifted within him" tells the change without dramatizing forfeiture or foreclosed options. The rain breaking the drought is coincidental convenience that undercuts earned causality. Under accumulative/textural logic one meaningful deepening suffices, but the final image asserts transformation without legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: who Elara is, where the courtyard is, and what world we inhabit remain vague past the 120-word mark, creating a persistent abstraction debt (−0.4). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric intensification toward a threshold moment), but the closure lacks legible cost—Elara "steps through" into the prism sanctuary with no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, no before/after tension. The piece offers Conceptual Repricing language ("lock and key to her own freedom") but the conceptual cost is asserted, not demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story operates as a static tableau rather than a causal sequence: Elias reflects on his art, performs a show (summarized), then reflects again the next morning with no meaningful change in options or knowledge. Orientation is delayed past 120 words—we cycle through calligrapher, radar dome, and puppet shows before anchoring who/where/when. The "closure" is Elias smiling and planning his next project, identical to his opening state; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails because no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (amber moth wing, monarch, knotted structures) and the final paragraph delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Aris lays hand to heart and the "interrupted cadence" crystallizes both broken and eternal. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). The closure unit is legible and reweights prior material with conceptual cost: the acknowledgment that the patterns will be lost but tonight they are honored. One minor slip: the cost is felt but remains largely abstract rather than a visible forfeiture of options or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under a causal lens with escalation: Elara enters, matches the organ card pattern to the rope, reconfigures it, and the sanctum responds. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she commits to remain as keeper—but the cost is declared rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or friction. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The tightening from card-matching to illumination is legible, but the final choice feels preordained rather than earned by a prior constraint that forced a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation establishes who/where/when by paragraph two, avoiding the test penalty. The story follows an accumulative/lyric lens through dream-state fragments, but the closure—Elara achieving tri-temporal presence—is told in summary rather than shown through a concrete image or action with visible cost. The phrase "boundaries between past, present, and future dissolving like sugar in water" is metaphorical assertion, not dramatized closure. No meaningful tightening or choice forecloses a path; the protagonist simply achieves what she sought without obstacle or price made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: the exact historical moment, spatial layout, and immediate stakes don't cohere until well past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The ending offers a decisive change (Anu transforms, gains marks), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. Causality is weak: the tile "begins rearranging" and lifts without prior agency from Anu; the climax feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into passive witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, avoiding debt. However, the closure unit—Marcus's reconciliation with his brother—depends on the brother's unexplained manifestation "through one of reality's shifting pathways," a coincidence that resolves the dominant stake without Marcus's causal agency. The inferred lens is Causal (because/therefore linkage), but the final image (brothers touching, music boxes "made whole") does not trace to a decision Marcus made; it traces to Elara's instruction and a convenient appearance. Cost is asserted ("broken and made whole") but not legible as a choice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~140 words) without functional disorientation that pays off at closure; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, twilight, synchronized breathing build toward transformation), but the closure unit—sextant repaired, dream freed—lands as summary rather than a decisive image with legible cost. The mirror maker's internal choice to "recreate freedom" is told, not shown in a moment where renunciation forecloses a path. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ruined orchard and runaway dream exist in parallel without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story opens with adequate orientation (who, where) but the closure unit—planting the seed after finding footprints—relies on an off-page reversal (daughter's visit) rather than on-page agency. The causal lens is attempted but weakened by the daughter's absence; Elara's bridge-building is accumulative textural work that shifts to a thematic statement in the final paragraph rather than a felt cost. The "deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists" moralizing replaces scene pressure at closure, reducing the ending to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no legible closure with cost. Elias moves from discovery to understanding to "prepared to step beyond temporal boundaries" without any on-page decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance that forecloses a path. The final paragraphs summarize cosmic implications rather than dramatizing a choice or showing felt consequence. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first several paragraphs rather than anchoring by ~120 words, though the effect is partly intentional (−0.3 applied). No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the arc is declarative escalation without reversal or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is, where she stands, and what immediate problem she faces remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure ("she made a silent promise") is a character declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the rescue succeeds off-page and no path is foreclosed. The lens is ambiguous (elements of causal and thematic accumulation compete without a clear dominant mode at the ending). The time traveler's setup and the colleague's plight are recounted rather than dramatized, severing because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors appear by ~120 words (carnival ship, Elara's gift), so no orientation penalty applies. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara explores the ship, accumulates narrative threads, and arrives at a closing realization. However, closure lacks visible cost—dissolving the card into her palm and "becoming part of the endless narrative threads" is metaphorical merge without a forfeited path or felt sacrifice. The final image reweights her purpose conceptually, qualifying as weak Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and delivers a clear Decisive Change (Eleanor merges past and present, meeting Croft). However, the closure lacks visible cost—Eleanor achieves her goal cleanly without trade-off or loss. The causal chain is present but tidy: each step follows logically without meaningful resistance or a tightening that narrows options. The ending reads as successful puzzle-solving rather than a choice with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative/Textural elements. The story establishes a clear problem (chaotic vibrations threaten ripple marks) and the mapkeeper's solution (bloom of hush via echo chamber stone) achieves equilibrium, creating a visible before/after. However, the closure feels inevitable rather than earned; the counter-frequency works without setback, and the energy beings' transformation from threat to harmony-bearer arrives without dramatized resistance. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of evolution) but not viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers star data, experiences a revelation about the "shard of hush," aligns the prism, and the beacon lights. The orientation (who, where, when) arrives within the opening paragraphs, satisfying the test. However, the central turn—the meteor-triggered insight and subsequent alignment—feels convenience-driven rather than causally motivated by prior pressure; the prism simply begins to glow when aligned, with no visible tradeoff or foreclosed option. The closure image (beacon rekindled, song joined by hum) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elthion descends, listens, conjectures from shadows, and writes, building density toward a final image of preservation. The closure moment—"this moment was already becoming a memory even as he lived it"—lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt nostalgic weight, and the final vow reweights the opening frame. However, no visible cost forecloses a path on the page; the archivist begins archiving and ends archiving, with no tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge in a way that alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clear: who/where/when anchor within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—imagery and motif accumulate toward a tonal shift at closure. However, the closure itself ("something had shifted; the gravity of hopelessness had been defied") is asserted rather than enacted with visible cost. The final paragraph tells us renewal occurred without showing a concrete choice, renunciation, or image that makes the before/after legible with felt pressure. The mosaic instructions serve as convenient exposition; Elias lights the firework and the fortress responds passively. No on-page reversal narrows his options or alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with adequate orientation (Maya, grotto, present conversation) but the closure unit is problematic: Maya's realization about the "texture of time" and transition periods arrives through extended reflection rather than dramatized pressure, and the cost of her new approach remains abstract. The conversation resumes but we see only the beginning of her response, not a completed change or reconfiguration with visible consequences. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost—it restates the theme. Applying Orientation Test: anchors are present early; no penalty. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Maya gives up or gains at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: gravity inverts, Elara rises, collects silence, descends. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. However, closure relies on off-page transformation ("it would transform...her understanding") rather than a decisive on-page change. The final image juxtaposes doll and vessel but the cost—what tactical option or relationship she forecloses—remains asserted rather than dramatized. One meaningful tightening (the ascent) occurs, but the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt in a specific choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    **Drive Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors arrive early (gondola, prism terrace, valley). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias settles into his stance "ready once again" with the storm glass predicting fair skies. The problem: no on-page cost or deepening—every passenger responds favorably, Elias encounters no obstacle, and the final image recycles the opening without a legible before/after pressure shift or felt sacrifice. The pattern of silence-shaping is taught but never tested. **Cost proof test fails:** no sentence in the ending beat shows a visible, felt, or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes a causal quest structure but never tightens meaningfully. Each obstacle (waterfall, murals, tree, elevator) dissolves on contact without altering Elara's options or knowledge in a way that forecloses a path. The "unclaimed throne" functions as a destination rather than a stake that shifts under pressure. The ending declares mission success and future hope but supplies no on-page cost—Elara smiles in satisfaction, her greatest adventure complete, with no visible sacrifice or renunciation that reweights what came before. Closure reads as completion, not transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a clear pattern (isolation → call → threshold crossing → connection) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the final image of walking toward dawn "linking through scars" reweights the sanctuary premise with visible cost (leaving the ashen comfort). Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by paragraph 2). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—she abandons her refuge—and the accumulative pressure through repeated motifs (scars, threshold, doorknocker) supports the ending shift.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    The inciting incident (glitchy text messages) arrives with immediate magical knowledge of hidden chambers, short-circuiting any discovery process. Causality is broken: Maya dismisses the first message as a scam, then "curiosity grew stronger" without dramatized experience to justify the shift. The climax is coincidence-resolved—she places the bolt on a conveniently humming pressure plate and watches a miracle unfold with no agency, risk, or cost. The closure unit lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; Maya gains diamonds but forfeits nothing and makes no choice that alters her stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words; "the dynasty ender" is a role, not a name, and no anchoring context establishes what "the dynasty" means or why this room matters until deep into the text. The closure—revealing a parchment—lands on the page, but the cost is absent: he simply tucks it away and plans to present it tomorrow with no visible sacrifice, resistance, or price paid. The causal lens is attempted but the gramophone's mechanics (standing waves unlocking a compartment) arrive as convenient magic with no prior constraints or failed attempts to earn the success.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors appear early (knight, greenhouse, night), satisfying the ~120-word test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building mystical density toward a final reweighting—but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Galen's "changed irrevocably" state and new role as "guardian of the spaces between realities" are declared, not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a prior option. The "unsnap" moment offers sensory spectacle (overlapping realities, paradoxical temperature) but no on-page trade-off or renunciation that makes a before/after legible with felt consequence. Without cost proof at closure, the Resonant Reconfiguration is incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, file details, and the button build toward the final meeting. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (archivist, file room, present day). However, closure lacks felt cost—the reunion is warm but consequence-free; neither character forecloses a path or pays a visible price. The "unfurred" typo and the phrase "both found what we were looking for" state resolution rather than dramatizing it. Escalation is minimal: Eleanor examines files, Benjamin arrives months later; no tightening narrows options between those beats.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but fractures into coincidence at key turns: the puddle-reflection map appears with no prior setup or cost, and Theodor materializes exactly when needed with the final piece of exposition. The Orientation Test penalty applies—"who" and "where" anchor by ~200 words, but "when" (relationship to the informant's "dawn breaks" warning) remains vague until late. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (data transferred, rebels escape) but the cost is abstract—"security forces closed in" yet the escape succeeds off-page with no visible price paid in tactics, injury, or sacrifice. The "memories will live elsewhere now" is told rather than dramatized, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Ethan plays, the prophecy is "hushed," and he feels relief—no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The prophecy itself is never dramatized as a live threat with escalating consequence, only asserted. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The final image summarizes understanding rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—density should build toward a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake. However, the piece loops through description of Elara's process without a meaningful tightening or deepening; the moonstone arrives as confirmation rather than complication, and the ending recaps her cycle without visible cost or foreclosed option. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after legible with felt cost; closure reads as summary affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening workshop paragraph. A Causal lens is inferrable: compass discovery → recognition → journey → underground chamber → new understanding. However, the closure lacks on-page cost; Elias "had learned" and "approached his work differently" are summary declarations rather than a decisive change with felt price. The underground clocks provide conceptual repricing of his philosophy, but the final paragraphs tell the outcome ("customers soon noticed") rather than showing a before/after moment with visible stakes. The causal chain is legible but the ending deflates into retrospective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (foundry, Elias, post-search). One tightening occurs when Elias shifts from searching to forging, but the closure—holding the new coin and declaring his wisdom—lacks visible cost; no prior option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The kintsugi principle is invoked as metaphor without constraining a choice. Closure reads as conceptual repricing, yet the cost remains abstract ("brokenness mended with gold") rather than legible in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within bounds. The story follows a pursuit-and-release arc with causal linkage (tooth → tracking → confession → liberation), landing a Decisive Change for Thomas. However, Elias's agency is minimal—Thomas's release occurs because the bell works, not because Elias makes a costly choice or endures friction. Cost is present for Thomas but not visibly felt by the protagonist, weakening closure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Kai waking in an ultraviolet forest post-anesthesia) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details and memory fragments build toward the pewter-strap revelation and the mathematical-mercy insight. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final line reweights survival as "the first variable"—but the cost is asserted ("discovery" rather than redemption) rather than felt through a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The ending image is evocative yet the transition from physical examination to abstract equation feels more told than shown, limiting closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with a lyric frame (childhood → adult → future child), but the closure unit—touching fragment to painting and "histories long overlooked flood into the present"—asserts transformation without showing visible cost or a legible before/after. The narrative compresses two decades into summary without causal linkage; key turns (finding the lens, studying paintings, arriving at the market) are told rather than dramatized. Orientation is delayed: who the narrator is and what stakes are live remains unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns, fluorescent timing, and the mainspring barrel build toward the 4:17 PM threshold when spirits materialize. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus raises the device, accepts his burden as calling, and the ticking cleaves the barrier, allowing dialogue with spirits. Cost is conceptual—he commits to his role—but the final image ("space between worlds...waiting for someone with the right tools") states rather than charges the reweighting. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (Marcus, ticket office, afternoon), and the lens holds, but the closure beat summarizes the transformation instead of dramatizing a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with legible cost. Eldon's "ritual" succeeds without dramatized stakes: the library reforms rather than shatters, and he "realizes he had both preserved and destroyed his life's work" in pure summary. No before/after change is legible—he ends where he began, cataloging. The orientation test penalty applies: who/where/when remain hazy past 120 words (cloud sea, glass orchard, "after reality had become negotiable" offers no spatial or temporal anchor). Drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative imagery without escalation, causal language without linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece orients who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Elias, baroque asteroid Chronos, after Time became visible). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the manuscript's creation accumulates symbolic weight and the final gathering reweights the conflict. However, closure lands as an RR (Charged Poise/conceptual shift) but cost is vague—Elias "had not ended the archaeological dispute, but he had transformed it" without a visible price paid (time, standing, a foreclosed revolutionary path with on-page consequence). The because/therefore linkage from covering mirrors → creating narrative → both sides gathering feels more thematic than causally tight; coincidence (temporal storm timing, both parties' immediate acceptance) edges near resolution rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative accent (resonance imagery), but the escalation is mostly procedural—Elias hums, works, and the covenant recoils without meaningful resistance or complication. Orientation is clean (workshop, midnight deadline, protagonist task established early). The closure unit is a Decisive Change (rust defeated, music restored citywide), but the cost is invisible: no on-page price, forfeiture, or tactic shift. The eleven-chime beat offers a micro turn, yet the final success arrives through mystical mechanics rather than protagonist sacrifice or a narrowed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words and signals a clear goal (explore the cliffs, follow the compass). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara "understands" her collection was preparation—but the epiphany is told rather than demonstrated through a final choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. The causal lens wobbles: the compass "guides her to a state of being" via psychometry, yet no on-page decision or visible cost anchors the transformation, leaving closure conceptually asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure is a summary of theme statements rather than a decisive change with cost: "She had discovered a deeper navigation system" and "forever changed" are told outcomes, not dramatized stakes. The magic lantern slide appears at ~20% but resolves Elena's artistic block instantly through passive vision rather than earned causality. The piece reads as a linear accumulation of declarative statements—Elena finds object, sees visions, makes sculpture, leaves—with no meaningful tightening or choice that forecloses a path. Orientation is present early, but the drive lens remains unclear: not causal (no because/therefore pressure), not accumulative (no pattern break or density shift), not situational (no stance crystallization under pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara collects clues (postcards, texts, cathedral image) until the cathedral visit crystallizes understanding. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final realization reweights the premise (flowers bloom to reveal themselves under transformed moonlight). However, cost is conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture charges the final image with felt sacrifice. The two-location structure (pavilion → cathedral → pavilion) fits mosaic allowance, but the middle cathedral sequence lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows options before the epiphany arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the story toggles between causal (diary triggers visions), accumulative (lagoon as recurring motif), and situational (protagonist receiving knowledge passively). Orientation arrives piecemeal—zeppelin library, coastal dunes, obsidian lagoon—but no clear spatial anchor for the opening beat until paragraph eight. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("published the unvarnished history") but occurs entirely off-page in summary, with no felt cost visible in the final image. The ending paragraph asserts transformation rather than demonstrating a before/after with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the opening paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elior posting notices and the community beginning to arrive—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallize, potential awakens), but the cost remains abstract and largely told ("difficult work of creating something meaningful together") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of reflection building to a manifesto and public invitation), yet the decisive tightening lacks an on-page action that forecloses a prior path with legible price. The ending reads more as preamble than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late—who, where, and when coalesce only after the wax cylinder introduction (~150 words in), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The prophecy functions as a told revelation rather than a dramatized turn; Elias pulls back from the shaving and simply knows the city will fall, with no visible cost or tactical constraint on the page. Closure reads as thematic declaration ("preserving the emotional patterns of a civilization") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt price. The lens wavers between Accumulative (sensory detail, orchard imagery) and Causal (prophecy as inciting event), never stabilizing by midpoint or at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Anya arranges seeds in decreasing entropy order, building toward the vortex manifestation. However, the closure unit—her touching the vortex and realizing "the texture of borrowed time was...the texture of herself"—leans heavily on abstraction rather than a concrete, legible transformation with visible cost. The final image delivers conceptual repricing but the cost remains atmospheric ("her own days were numbered") rather than foregrounding a specific forfeiture or trade-off that alters her state on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, what) and builds toward the solstice test, but the closure—bell ringing on its own at zero hour—lands as validation rather than decisive change with felt cost. The design reads Accumulative/Textural: years of observation culminate in a single confirming note. However, the final image ("the mountain itself had been trying to talk") reconfigures prior material only conceptually; no on-page choice by Elias alters his situation or forecloses a path. Cost is implied (twenty years of isolation) but not dramatized in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening. The piece attempts a Decisive Change when Elion steps beyond the station and returns transformed, but the causal chain is broken: no prior constraint prevents him from leaving earlier, and the "call" appears without setup. The closure unit lacks visible cost—"forever changed" and "glowing with wisdom" are told outcomes with no on-page forfeiture, renunciation, or tactical alteration that the reader can trace. Under an attempted Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage dissolves at the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "recluse," "oasis," and "ghosts visible" across the opening three paragraphs without anchoring *who* (name, age, gender) or *when* (how long post-Veil, season, time of day) by ~120 words; this triggers the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and caps Q3 at 7.0. The closure—box opens, bee dissolves—lacks felt cost: no option is foreclosed, no tactic changes, and the recluse's situation remains identical. The accumulative pattern (repeated "through contextual clues," "astonished recluse") is not taught early or paid off; it reads as template cadence rather than purposeful design. Drive lens is ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, further weakening coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful closure unit lands on the page. The story offers thematic arrival ("found her place in the tapestry") without a decisive change, visible cost, or stakes reconfiguration. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive but "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "after the Great Reckoning" remain abstract past 120 words without concrete grounding. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—Elara's understanding deepens in summary rather than through on-page pressure. The fragment warming in her palm is gestural, not a felt cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    No meaningful closure unit is present: the poet writes, watches a kite, writes more, then walks away "carrying the memory" in a summary that asserts completion without on-page change. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with visible cost. The kite-string snap is framed as metaphor for "liberation she often felt" rather than a moment that alters her present options or stance. Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early), preventing deeper penalty, but the ending offers thematic echo rather than resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the copper-wire network grows across months, culminating in a final circuit and light-symphony closure. Orientation anchors quickly (island caretaker, temple orchard, diagnosis). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias completes his work and dies peacefully, foreclosing further action with visible cost—his death). However, the "six months" timeframe compresses five months into summary ("by the third month," "month five") with minimal scene pressure; the final circuit lands but the escalation reads more as elapsed-time montage than tightening choices. Cost is visible (death) but the causal because/therefore linkage between wire-wrapping and interspecies awakening is asserted rather than dramatized with friction or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece establishes a loose Accumulative lens (spring imagery, tower approach, amber placement) but the closure unit—placing the amber and experiencing understanding—lacks visible cost or felt consequence. Elian walks in, sets down the object, achieves epiphany, and walks out with no option foreclosed or tactic altered. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame is told rather than dramatized, and the footprints he follows never create a reversal or complicate his approach. Orientation is present early (tower, spring, Elian) so no penalty there, but the ending offers conceptual claim without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors appear late (who/where/when crystallize only after ~150 words of abstract scene-painting). The piece opens with accumulative texture but never commits to a drive lens; by midpoint it has not taught whether causality, pattern, or situational pressure will govern closure. The ending summarizes decades of change ("Years later, travelers would speak…") rather than landing a decisive on-page moment with visible cost. No clear before/after is legible in the coachman's final paragraph—he witnesses what he "unleashed" but the closure image is passive observation, not reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is causal (follow grooves → decode → find coordinates → arrive), and the ending provides a physical reunion plus a thematic statement via the paired leaves. However, the closure lacks felt cost: Silas completes his quest without renunciation, endurance, or a visible price paid on the page. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), and the lens holds, but the final image does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply fulfills the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with visible cost. Elara begins sketching star charts and ends having completed one, but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs that forecloses a path or reconfigures meaning with felt price. The "understanding" she reaches in the final paragraph is asserted rather than earned through causal pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, but the accumulative lens suggested by the ritual never tightens or deepens; each paragraph restates her isolation and purpose without escalation. The ending's "true north had been within her all along" is a thematic echo, not a dramatized closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where he starts, and why he climbs remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The master's arrival "somehow" and the sky's wrongness lack causal linkage; no on-page event explains how the master reached the apex first or why the sky fractured now. The closure—placing the sundial lid—reads as a mechanical reset without felt cost; the sky "corrects" via golden light, but no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The causal lens collapses under convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes a situational frame—Elara walks patterns to "unbind" memories during an interregnum—but the mechanics remain vague and the stakes abstract. No on-page reversal tightens options; the pawn simply appears after she completes her pattern, reading as reward rather than cost. The closure lacks visible sacrifice: she gains a materialized memory without losing anything tangible or foreclosing a path. The two errant Chinese sentences and their corrections break immersion and signal a generation artifact that undermines authorial control at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece orients who and where by paragraph one, but causality remains weak throughout: Maven touches the stone, gains powers, uses the feather, and the bookstore "dissolves into pure light" without meaningful opposition or narrative friction. The closure offers a thematic realization ("home wasn't a place at all") but no decisive change in her situation or visible cost—she stands in a transformed space having learned a lesson, with no path foreclosed or price paid. The drive lens wobbles between attempted Causal (stone enables power) and Accumulative/Textural (ritual repetition, thematic layering), never cohering; the ending reads as abstract revelation rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—no clear spatial anchor or "who is speaking when" until well into the piece. The closure hinges on the prince appearing in a chamber, but no prior beat establishes the prince as alive, accessible, or part of the labyrinth's mechanism, creating a causality gap. The four-minute lull is declared but never tightens a choice; time pressure evaporates. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending delivers a tidy reconciliation rather than a charged reconfiguration of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, but no decisive change occurs on the page. The story recounts Elara's preparation and declares her success in the final paragraph without dramatizing the moment her actions narrow options or impose cost. The ending summarizes theme ("Whether she would be forgiven...mattered less") rather than landing a closure beat with felt consequence. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain stalls; under Accumulative, no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marcel traces pockmarks that correspond to memories, building toward a kintsugi epiphany. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (alchemist, floating workshop, acid sea, forty years). However, the closure unit—Marcel's realization that uncertainty was "necessary preparation" and that he should mend with "intention rather than perfection"—reads as Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost on the page. The final two paragraphs tell the reader the transformation occurred rather than dramatizing a moment where options narrow or a path forecloses. The statute tracing accumulates detail but does not tighten pressure or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: aging quay painter, seaside cottage, harbor. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: decades of painting → wrong turn → cave discovery → painted shell → closure image of renewed purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias finds his own forgotten work and understands "temporary eternity," reweighting his artistic mission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed stance) with felt cost (acceptance that beauty is both temporary and preserved by nature, not just him). The cost is conceptual and emotional but legible in the final painting and the shell's weight "both familiar and new." Minor causality smoothness: the cave discovery and shell placement feel convenient rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Elias tests his theory at dawn after the heat wave breaks. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias feels the vibration return and the captain's acknowledgment reweights the premise. However, the sister's response halfway around the world lacks causal linkage to Elias's specific act; the coincidence complicates but does not resolve with visible cost on Elias's page. The final image ("keeper of whispers") reprises the premise but does not foreclose a path or show a felt trade-off—cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than concretely legible in Elias's present circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of guiding ships home, moon-phase rhythm). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; ships arrive in the same manner throughout, and the cryptic call at midnight introduces a task ("build the bridge between tides") without on-page execution or consequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "endless cycle" framing, but cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or reweighted choice. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived; the greater issue is that accumulation lacks a decisive cadence shift or cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual, relic discovery, quiet realization), but the closure lacks visible cost: Elara achieves stillness, finds a second eye, and turns homeward with implied mission—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The second glass eye arrival feels serendipitous rather than earned through prior tactical choices. Orientation is adequate (truffle forager, ravine, post-virus world by ~10%), but the bulk of the middle is reflection and world-building rather than escalating pressure that changes knowledge or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens (stranger's signal → investigation → understanding) with clear anchors by the third paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias mimics the gesture, transforming isolation into connection), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, no tactic altered, only a felt shift. The borrowed memories resolve into narrative exposition rather than dramatized pressure that narrows options. The ending image reconfigures the premise but the price is conceptual, not legible in action or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story employs a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: Elias follows ants (causal link) into a cavern where symbolic doorways accumulate meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—stepping through one doorway and emerging transformed—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization), but the cost remains largely told ("solitude had shifted") rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the doorways reveal unlived paths, narrowing Elias's existential options.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (dream → grotto → reflection → return). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose, Earned Stasis of continued duty with secret wellspring), but the cost is asserted ("weight lifted") rather than felt on the page. The bleeding starlight pool reveals younger self, yet no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters tactics—revelation alone without dramatized consequence weakens the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara at the ember nexus) and establishes a waiting-for-secret frame. However, the secret itself is never disclosed, leaving the central causal hinge abstract. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing: Elara will now capture "the weight between words and transformation," but the cost is declared ("revalue everything") rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or changed tactic. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final deepening lacks an on-page micro-choice that makes the before/after legible with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (grave, scroll, symbols) and atmospheric density aim to reweigh the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words; when remains slippery but is thematized. The closure unit—Elias returning to his body, touching the scroll, and resuming the chronicle—reads as Earned Stasis (refusal to stop chronicling despite fractured time). Cost is oblique: he continues the cycle without resolving confusion, foreclosing rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when he "understood why he chronicled," though the understanding is told rather than tested. No causality breaks, but the final image does not sharply reconfigure prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the shop opening within acceptable range. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a connection formed, mutual recognition achieved) but the cost remains abstract—Elara's "heart lighter than it had been in months" does not foreclose an option or demonstrate felt price on the page. The accumulative lens is signaled through water-clock drips and layered conversation, yet the ending reweights prior material softly without undeniable pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture; the ceremony proceeds because/therefore through concrete steps (dip quill, channel scar, resist crystallization). Closure lands on-page: the rune work succeeds, the quill sheds its tip as confirmation, and the parchment is stored—a Decisive Change with visible accomplishment. Cost is present but muted; the "scars transformed into stories" reads more like fulfillment than a price paid, and the storm's arrival feels atmospheric rather than a constraint that narrows her final options.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual gathers sensory and symbolic density (perfume, music, copper wire, dust motes) toward a final image (the incomplete sheet music) that reweights the reconciliation premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the apology is accepted, the sheet music left behind signals unfinished healing—but the felt cost is asserted more than dramatized; we're told reconciliation is "imperfect" and "like their reconciliation" rather than seeing a specific forfeiture or tactical shift that makes the incompleteness undeniable on the page. The accumulative pattern holds, but the ending image doesn't decisively recharge prior particulars with visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; who/where/when remain vague abstractions (translucent witness, liminal space, universe's hiccup) without concrete anchor. The piece teaches an accumulative pattern of cosmic integration, but closure arrives through summary ("spiral arbitration completed") rather than on-page decisive change or felt cost. The dictionary glows and fills with patterns, but no before/after options or tactics are legible—cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via conceptual repricing: Arlo's realization that "clocks measure what we give them" reweights his lifelong question. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—he simply "vow[s] never to use [the key] conventionally again" without dramatized consequence or foreclosed option. The escalation (water reversal, counting backwards 1–5) proceeds without opposition or tightening; the fjord remains static. The final paragraph summarizes years of wisdom rather than landing a decisive image, softening the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost. Elena moves from discovery to reflection to a vague "pilgrimage" intention, but no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—she simply decides to continue doing what she's already been doing. The Fibonacci sequence discovery offers a micro-turn but leads nowhere causally. Orientation is adequate (Moscow library, post-heart-attack timeframe established early), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: accumulative texture competes with causal setup that never pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraphs. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from isolation to curated connection, reweighting "cultivated estrangement" as "a curated space for new beginnings." However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page sentence shows what he forfeits or what live option he forecloses. The causal lens wobbles: the glass disc "calling out" to Meredith and the line working after thirty-seven years read as magical convenience rather than motivated causality, undercutting the because/therefore linkage at the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a clear temporal anchor (twilight, fortnight of visits, final night before digitization) and maintains spatial coherence on the jetty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist layers ritual actions (mixing powders, drawing, sealing the vial) to deepen his relationship with analog preservation. However, the closure unit—turning away with the locket and journal—reconfigures meaning only subtly; the "haunted euphoria" and acceptance were already present from the opening, so the final image intensifies rather than decisively shifts his stance. Cost is implied (loss of purpose, transition to obsolescence) but not felt as a visible forfeiture on the page; he packs up and walks forward without dramatized resistance or renunciation that would qualify as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the rumor mechanism suggests causal linkage, but the piece accumulates texture through list-like beats. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Archie realizing connection comes from sharing rumors, not the rock itself—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible price paid on the page. The rumor's spread is summarized in montage fragments rather than dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain. One tightening occurs (rumor ignites community interest), but it lacks on-page agency or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (ring, melody, stillpoint) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the closure—Elion kneeling, absorbing wisdom, then rising transformed—occurs largely through summary and assertion ("understanding, compassion, wisdom beyond words") rather than a concrete image or action that makes the cost visible. The cost is told (tears, emotional shift) but not dramatized in a way that forecloses a path or crystallizes a new stance with undeniable pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal (pen intervention → Sarah's correction), and the closure unit (Sarah's data revision, Elara's affirmation) appears on the page with a before/after. However, the cost is abstract: "straightening time's course" lands as conceptual claim rather than visible forfeiture—Elara loses no capability, relationship, or option on the page. The midpoint pen-use beat links to the outcome, but the mechanism ("contingent relationships") is explained rather than dramatized through tactical constraints. Orientation is prompt (who/where/when by paragraph two), and the single-scene frame fits scope, but closure lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: repetitive beats of Elias "mapping silence" without because/therefore linkage or narrowing options. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final "joyful sorrow" reprise, but no visible or felt cost appears on the page—no path is foreclosed, no choice alters tactics. The ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; "Archive of Aeridor" and "off-grid" function as labels without spatial grounding. The closure—Maya seeing her own face in the restored portrait—arrives via summary ("Years passed, and Maya's library grew") rather than on-page dramatization with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the redemption arc is asserted, not charged. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence at closure makes the price of transformation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (causal escape + accumulative lyric texture) but wavers: the four-minute window is causal setup, yet closure relies on conceptual repricing (the lagoon manifests, validating entanglement permanence). Orientation debt is mild—who/where emerge by ~150 words—but "when" remains vague (night of escape, but broader timeline unclear). The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: they stand together, defying separation), yet cost is announced rather than dramatized: no on-page consequence for the monitoring systems returning, no tactical price paid in the escape itself. The claim "separation becomes merely an illusion" abstracts the stakes rather than landing them in image or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Situational elements (Marlo positions himself, whispers directions, demonstrates superiority). The closure—Marlo adding a new map and the coin cooling—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual at best; no visible price is paid and no option is foreclosed. The "challenge" to Vance resolves through demonstration rather than a decisive change in relationship or stance. Orientation anchors arrive early (labyrinth worker, container maze, geomagnetic storm) but the whisper-versus-shout premise lands as premise fulfillment rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates descriptive patterns (shutters, light, darkness) but never tightens or deepens the visitor's stake in a way that narrows options or changes knowledge. The "half-spoken secret" is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or choice alters what either character can or will do. The ending offers a gesture (the nod, the departure) without visible cost—the secret remains unspoken and its transformation is told, not shown. Orientation is adequate (who/where by ~120 words), preventing a deeper penalty, but the closure unit lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors appear late (~para 7 establishes the cobalt library clearly). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the town "changed forever"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: we're told people "began to talk" and Arthur hears "wonder rather than resignation," yet no on-page scene shows a choice foreclosed or a visible price paid. The window-display plan is summarized in one sentence; the three-week execution is told, not shown. The ending claims transformation without demonstrating it through a concrete before/after image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (dock worker, sublittoral fringe, post-violence world), satisfying the test. The closure unit—Mara diving toward the island and emerging "reborn"—reads as Decisive Change, but the cost remains vague: what exactly does she forfeit by leaving the docks? The other workers "speak for years" of her vanishing, yet no on-page relationship or stake tied to shore is established earlier to charge that loss. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered atmosphere, whale song, scrimshaw fragments), but the final deepening lacks a concrete price or foreclosed path visible in the text. The image of her "taking with it to depths" gestures at closure but does not land a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation (farmhouse, turbines, post-mandate world) within the opening third. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of "remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness" reweights the premise—but the cost remains largely conceptual and asserted rather than felt through a specific on-page forfeiture or choice. The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric elements, but the final turn doesn't sufficiently narrow options or demonstrate a visible price paid; the protagonist's daily ritual continues unchanged, and the visitors' presence is summarized rather than dramatized as a transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words). However, the closure lacks visible cost: the poet completes their transformation, gains wisdom, and departs with "lightness of their newfound freedom" and "new purpose"—a pure gain with no loss or trade-off legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mystical imagery building toward transformation), but the final passages summarize outcomes rather than landing a charged image or moment where cost is felt. The ending tells us the journey "had just begun" rather than dramatizing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is hybrid accumulative/causal: the Fibonacci arrangement accumulates symbolic weight, then triggers a discrete transformation. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when clarify only after ~180 words of mythic preamble. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's color returns, Gideon gains new purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page line shows what Elara risked or lost. The phoenix-rebirth frame remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test waiver does not apply: who/where/when are present but stakes remain vague well past 120 words. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the protagonist begins curious and ends curious with no foreclosed path or visible cost. The piece reads as a static meditation rather than a narrative arc; the miner's song discovery produces no tightening of options or reweighting of her quest. Drive lens is ambiguous (accumulative texture is suggested but no cadence shift or density break materializes at closure); applying −0.4 in Q2 and capping at 7.2 per the lens-ambiguity rule, though the deeper issue is absence of closure, which pulls the score lower.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the piece summarizes Elena's past transformation and ongoing work without a decisive change, stance crystallization, or conceptual repricing occurring in narrative present. The entire text is retrospective telling—"had been," "had found," "would sit"—with no forward pressure or tightening. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (we learn "Elena" and "mourning jewelry maker" late in paragraph one, location vague until paragraph three). The piece reads as character sketch rather than story with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through dialogue and shared understanding rather than causal reversals. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—two minds joining to solve a vast mystery—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page foreclosure of a path or visible sacrifice marks the collaboration. The visitor's revelation ("could prevent future crashes") lands as assertion rather than a dramatized reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—vacillates between causal (purification process), accumulative (image montage), and metaphysical transformation without teaching a coherent pattern. Closure is conceptual merger stated in exposition ("her consciousness merging with the past") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but the "steadily unpredictable" atoms and "avoiding patterns" method are introduced without clear mechanics that constrain later action. The ending asserts transformation but does not dramatize the cost or make a before/after legible through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story assembles a pattern of shadow observations building toward the revelation of the friend's face, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow reunites with its source conceptually). However, the cost remains abstract—Elara continues her work with altered understanding but no forfeited path or visible price. The orientation is clear early (library, Elara, her role), and the lens holds, but the closure effect is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early). However, no on-page closure with felt cost exists—Elara arrives at the workshop already resolved to "reconstruct" and simply narrates her epiphany to the chameleon across 23 paragraphs of reflective summary. The "transformation" is told in past perfect ("had been," "had brought") and present assertion ("began to rebuild") without a discrete before/after moment where options narrow or a path forecloses. The piece reads as a single static meditation rather than a pressure-driven sequence, violating the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: anesthesia fog and tower placement remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens is ambiguous—initially causal (hourglass mechanics, coffee-ring map), then shifts to lyric-accumulative (plant voices, integration theme) without teaching the pattern early or holding it cleanly at closure. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (scars as testaments, not puzzles), but cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of Elara's options. The "displaced miracle" returns to earth, but what Elara sacrificed or lost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Elena, projection booth), but causality is absent: no because/therefore linkage drives events, only a static séance where Elena touches film, receives impressions, and declares intent. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—Elena begins able to read film and ends promising to project it, with no options foreclosed or stance crystallized on the page. Under any inferred lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the closure unit fails the cost-proof test: no sentence makes a before/after legible with felt price. The repetitive middle beats (lines 10–26) loop through synonym variations of "unused love stored in film" without escalation or turn.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (aurora archway, stardust inheritance, unspoken words accumulate toward a ritual reweighting), but the closure unit is asserted rather than enacted: "Elara felt the ice in her creative channels begin to thaw" summarizes the transformation without on-page decisive change or visible cost. The final image—"turned from the aurora-lit archway, a moonstruck dreamer reborn"—declares closure rather than charging it through enacted constraint or forfeited path. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening, waiving that penalty, but the ending substitutes metaphor for dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery of glowing dunes, frozen chess clock, and sparks recurs with cadence shifts toward hope. Orientation anchors (freight guard, midnight train, desert) arrive early enough. The chess clock ticking at 00:01 offers a micro-turn, and the seed sprouting provides a final image, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint dramatized. The closure reconfigures the fractured world's possibility without making the guard's price legible in action or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece anchors who and where promptly, satisfying orientation. However, no meaningful pressure tightens or changes on the page: Kaelen moves through the forest, examines the gear, places it, sleeps, wakes, and accepts his state in a flat sequence of realizations without causality or cost. The "closure" is a thematic declaration ("this was just the beginning") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence. The gear's placement triggers a visual shimmer but forecloses no path and imposes no visible price—it simply grants him what he already desired.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" anchors by ~200 words, "where" remains vague throughout (mist-locked passages, invisible shore, veiled ridgeway are interchangeable abstractions), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dense imagery building to the dragon chamber—but the closure lacks decisive cost: receiving dragons is passive acceptance, not choice that forecloses a path. The "vigil complete" declares closure without showing visible consequence or altered stance. Causality is present but thin; the star stamp heats and pulls them forward without clear because/therefore linkage to their earlier actions.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details about the fortress, the bolt, the etchings, and the cost accumulate toward a final image where singing reweights the dominant stake of safety versus silence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the bellhop's decision to sing transforms the fortress and his stance, with cost legible in the line "the safety of isolation wasn't worth the unpardonable silence it demanded." One meaningful deepening occurs when he pulls the bolt free and understands the musicians' sacrifice, narrowing his options to complicity or reversal. The cost is felt but slightly diffuse across the final paragraph rather than crystallized in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who Elara is (exiled heir), where she is (ancient temple library), and her immediate goal are signaled early, but the mechanics of how "cryptic messages left in library books" allow her to "communicate with the past" remain vague and unmotivated past the 120-word threshold. The closure unit—Elara discovering the pretender is her own fear—lacks causal setup; no prior beats show her wrestling with self-doubt or projecting her fear outward. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (library collapse, ink rituals, ancestor messages), but the ending pivots to a psychological revelation without accumulating concrete pressure or cost tied to that realization. The phrase "time itself seemed to shatter, revealing the pretender's true form" is a summary assertion rather than a dramatized discovery, and the cost of walking away from the throne is declared ("freed from the burden") rather than shown as a painful forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is clear by name, but "where" (monitoring station's relation to land/shelf) and "when" (post-ban timeline) remain vague until deep into the piece. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—Marina observes, taps, cross-references—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the "realization" is told, not earned by prior pressure. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (Earth returning to pre-industrial state) but the cost is abstract and societal, not felt or visible in Marina's choices on the page. The final image of logging data lacks the charge needed to reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—the protagonist walks, finds stones, steps in, receives light, with no reversal or narrowing of options. The closure unit lacks visible cost: she "smiles" and becomes "ready to reignite," but no path is foreclosed and no trade-off is legible on the page. Drive lens is ambiguous (mixes causal setup with lyric mood without committing), and the Charged Poise standard is not met because pressure never crystallizes into a stance with undeniable stakes. The ancient stone circle appears in paragraph 9 without prior setup, resolving a quest it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: attempted Causal, but linkage is weak. The kite appears coincidentally, the script decodes off-page in summary ("For three days, Maya worked"), and the chamber opens with spoken words—no on-page obstacle or reversal tests her agency. Closure reads as Decisive Change (embryo retrieved), but the cost is asserted thematically ("to honor both her heritage and her vision") rather than felt through forfeited paths or visible sacrifice. Orientation is clear early. The three-day decoding montage compresses the pivotal turn into summary, flattening causality at the story's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with the photograph serving as a recurring anchor. Orientation is delayed—we learn setting details gradually through the first third—but the pattern of ritual-to-release provides structural coherence. The closure (releasing the photograph to the wind) constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost: she relinquishes the last physical evidence of her past. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract; the piece tells us she "remained frozen" but doesn't show how this forfeiture alters her immediate or future options beyond symbolic release.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Eleanor's thread-sorting intensifies her connection to her craft, culminating in a completed portrait that reweights her relationship to perfection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she embraces fragmentation rather than fixing it), but the cost is conceptual and implied rather than dramatized with visible forfeit. The final insight—"fragmented reality had not been a problem to fix but a perspective to embrace"—is stated rather than shown through a choice that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive early and remain stable. The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: eclipse → ink experiment → temporal displacement → reappearance with insight. However, the central causal link—how stepping into spilled ink enacts temporal displacement—remains unexplained mechanics ("the designs on the ink flared with impossible light"). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the realization "We change our relationship to it during moments of crisis"), but cost is asserted rather than shown: the tracker "gasps" and vitals fluctuate, yet immediately commands the drone and reaches for a journal with no visible foreclosed path or tactical constraint. The lens holds, but the cost at closure is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening. The closure unit—Elena uploading the letter and awaiting consequences—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no on-page consequence, no forfeited relationship, no immediate price paid. The decision feels inevitable from paragraph one, eliminating meaningful tightening or deepening. The piece teaches a pattern of declarative summary ("dangerous liaison," "contraband truths") but does not dramatize the pressure that would make the choice costly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a static tableau: Rhiannon tends roses in her dome after societal collapse. No inciting pressure arrives, no reversal occurs, and no on-page decision alters her situation. The ending wraps shears and declares continuation, which is thematic assertion rather than closure with felt cost. Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early), but the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural without a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (sound-wave garden, voicing silence, transliterated emotions) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the fisher rests with his catch. However, the cost remains abstract—"his purpose complete"—without a legible forfeiture or tension that the ending image reconfigures. The orientation is clear (who, where, when by the opening lines), and the pattern holds, but the closure lacks felt weight because the divine catch imposes no visible sacrifice or transformation on the fisher himself.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece orients who and where by the second paragraph, but causality remains vague: the journalist's "allegations" and Eleanor's counter-theory are summarized, not dramatized. The climax—"Eleanor finally had it"—occurs off-page between paragraphs, replacing scene pressure with a told resolution. No on-page reversal or tightening constrains her options; she moves from documents to phone call without visible cost, yielding a closure assertion rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elias follows Arden's method to commune with lost sounds, connects the amber, and hears his daughter's lullaby. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines). The closure—hearing the lullaby and tattooing notes—lands on the page, but the cost is muted: "quieted the dissonance" and "stillness rather than emptiness" are stated transformations without a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The firmware's spontaneous translation of the lullaby (not a cry) feels convenient; no prior beat establishes why this specific sound would emerge or what Elias risked to summon it.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with abstract labels ("the unlearning," "emergent hush," "lilac unease") that remain unanchored in concrete who/where/when past the 120-word gate, triggering orientation debt. The climactic "interject" beat is summarized—"he adjusted a spiral of blue sand… suddenly his creation resonated"—without showing *how* the adjustment works or what Silas risks. Closure disperses into collective activity ("they lay back… whispering gallery tile flakes passed between them") with no single protagonist choice or visible cost; the final paragraph asserts "deep contentment" but offers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (ancient plaza, post-fire timeframe, Elias as focal character) within the first 120 words. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elias walks, finds the tessera, places it, performs the ritual, and speaks to witnesses—pressure accumulates through layered images and the naming act. Closure occurs when Elias renames "Samarkhand" and others witness the plaza respond, followed by his declarative speech and departure; this is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ritual crystallizes his revolutionary stance. Cost is more conceptual than visceral—the piece asserts that "naming" reclaims the plaza but does not dramatize what Elias forfeits or risks in the act beyond his continued walking.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece signals a Causal lens (fractured timeline → performance → restoration) but the closure unit lacks felt cost. Silas completes his task and dissolves "allowing himself" into mist, which reads as release rather than foreclosure with price. The orientation anchors (stage ghost, hedge maze, orchard) arrive early, but the inciting pressure (timeline unraveling) is asserted rather than shown through a specific on-page change. The ending offers a Decisive Change in the garden's state but Silas's own arc feels like mission completion without a visible tradeoff or renunciation that alters his options.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between causal (devising a method) and accumulative/textural (light patterns as symbolic accrual)—and no closure unit lands on the page. Maya "finally devised the protocol" and "prepared to share her findings" are summary declarations occurring off-page; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing is dramatized with visible cost. The ending substitutes assertion ("healing would come—one pathway at a time") for scene pressure, violating the on-page closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-adjacent but lacks because/therefore linkage; Maya's discovery of the fossil occurs through exploration rather than narrowed options or prior choices. Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words, avoiding the penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding her role), but cost is asserted ("renewed purpose") rather than demonstrated through a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice. The fossil "choosing" her and settling into her pouch reads as convenient bestowal, not earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece violates the orientation test: who/where/when anchors appear early but "what" (the jar's discovery, the prophecy's nature, why buttons matter) remains vague past the 120-word threshold and never resolves into clear causal pressure. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative patterning is suggested but the buttons-to-prophecy mechanism remains opaque, preventing legible closure. The ending delivers thematic declaration ("wisdom grows when shared") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any identifiable lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with some Situational pressure; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid) where Aleksandr accepts fractures as maps and walks downhill with resolve. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The tightening is achieved through density increase and cadence shift in the final third, reweighting the snow-code ritual and the pillbox's meaning. However, the cost is more asserted ("new courage was forged") than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page; the walk downhill is a symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: the coachman performs a ritual while waiting for rain to stop, layering atmospheric detail and reflective claims about "palimpsest promise" and "balance between worlds." However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—he completes the ritual, packs away the needle, and departs exactly as planned. The final image ("spindrift serenity," horses "patient as stones") restates the opening calm without reweighting prior material or imposing felt cost. Closure form is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece establishes who (Kael), where (oasis), and stakes (understanding resistance to decay) by the fourth paragraph, satisfying orientation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring images (lantern glass, smoke, wildflowers) layer toward a conceptual repricing of "resistance" as love's memory. However, no on-page cost is legible at closure—Kael's resolve to return is aspirational, not a decision that forecloses a path or exacts a visible price. The final paragraph summarizes intent ("resolved to return") rather than dramatizing a choice or renunciation. Without felt or conceptual cost anchoring the closure unit, Q2 cannot rise above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~200 words before "Down at the docks"), and the disorientation does not charge closure. The closure unit—Mara continuing her grandmother's work—lacks visible cost; she gains wisdom and peaceful communion with Jim, but no path is foreclosed and no trade-off materializes on the page. The encounter with Jim is pure coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational-lens rules. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into convenient backstory exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece offers no clear closure unit—Elena's realization in the final paragraph is told rather than shown through a decisive act, renunciation, or charged image with legible cost. The narrative is entirely retrospective summary with no present-tense scene pressure; "today's awakening" is declared but never dramatized in a continuous beat. Causality is vague: the reincarnation memory "flooded her consciousness three moons ago," yet no on-page event tests or changes her stance now. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but the final line delivers abstract assertion instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when are anchored early (Elara, lotus temple, after cloud bursts); waive penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increase and cadence shift attempt to reweight the dominant stake. Closure unit: Conceptual Repricing attempted in the final sequence where Elara claims to understand connection and writes her own declaration. However, the cost is asserted ("she would never write another letter that didn't contain this truth") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited opportunity, lost client, or visible renunciation on the page. The ending reads as epiphany-by-declaration without an on-page action or image that makes the before/after legible with felt consequence. Apply −0.8 for closure ambiguity and −0.4 for the lack of visible cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story delivers a clear Decisive Change (the signal stops, tensions ease) with some felt cost (Elara's isolation, the risk of trickster retaliation). However, the closure arrives through off-page effects reported a week later rather than an on-page crystallization of pressure. The causal lens is attempted but weakened by gaps: we are told the tricksters manipulate through frequency, but the mechanics of Elara's interference and its success are asserted rather than dramatized. The final image defaults to summary ("new power plays had just begun") instead of a resonant reconfiguration tied to specific prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words and maintains coherent spatial logic through the nexus chamber. However, the closure—Elara stepping through a portal that turns out to be "not a physical object but a passage"—arrives as a told realization rather than an earned turn; the compass point "clattered to the stone ground, its purpose fulfilled" tells us the mutiny succeeded without showing the cost or changed stakes on the page. The lens reads Causal through most beats, but the ending shifts to summary mode ("leaving the shadowed nexus behind and embracing whatever lay beyond") that diffuses pressure rather than crystallizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes who/where/when cleanly and moves through investigative beats with causal links (ribbon → mask design → custom order → assistant). However, closure relies on off-page confession rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final image ("empathy never truly disappears") offers thematic summary instead of a charged moment that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as Causal but the ending replaces scene pressure with exposition, weakening the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with late Accumulative elements (coded stanzas, coffin nail). Orientation anchors arrive within bounds. The closure—initiating the ancestor's system—occurs on the page, but felt cost is vague: Eli prepares to "question decades of meteorological consensus" without showing what personal or professional path is foreclosed. The reversible-exile theme is asserted in dialogue rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening (discovery of hidden controls) is present, but the stakes remain conceptual rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Elias is, what "bridge-song fiddler" means, why he's at this pullout) and never anchors his ordinary world or what he stands to lose; apply −0.4 for orientation debt. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but closure is a passive ascent with no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing—only iterative poetic assertion. No visible cost: Elias loses nothing by stepping onto the scaffold, and the final paragraph's claims ("heal every wound," "pure, unfiltered light of understanding") are told outcomes, not on-page reweightings. The drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric catalog or causal journey?) past midpoint and unresolved at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece attempts an accumulative/textural design across a multi-year timeframe but lacks a coherent closure unit with visible cost. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("why some paths circle back") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and what he's doing in the circus train remains unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The Marcus confrontation scene appears mid-story but dissolves without consequence; the subsequent "unwinding over months" is summarized rather than dramatized, breaking causal linkage at the moment closure should land.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—unlocking healing formulas through shared translation—lands on the page, but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no specific loss, renunciation, or altered relationship is visible in the final image. The causal chain from telegram to star-pattern to collaboration proceeds without obstacle or reversal, reading as and-then sequencing. The ending summarizes satisfaction and preparation for future dreams instead of showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure occurs—mentor freed, glamour revealed—but the cost is abstract and told ("accepted this truth") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible trade-off. The "expanding circles" progression reads as a numbered checklist (first, second, third...) without causal linkage; each circle delivers its payload on schedule regardless of protagonist action. Orientation is established early (druid at vortex edge), so no penalty there. The drive lens appears Causal but the middle beats are Accumulative catalog, creating ambiguity that undermines escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where anchor by ~120 words but "when" remains vague ("after the future arrives early" is conceptual, not temporal). The piece attempts an Accumulative lens but lacks a legible closure unit—the restoration is summarized in exposition ("they had found...their true purpose") rather than dramatized with visible cost. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the visionary encounters no resistance, and the maze transformation is convenient rather than earned. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what was sacrificed or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (Elara), where (catacomb orchard), and what (trammel a wandering memory) within the first third. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns of roots, bones, light, and the burned card build density toward the final absorption of the memory. However, closure lands as a ritual completion without clear before/after cost—the card absorbs the sorrow, balance is restored, and Elara continues her vigil unchanged. The final image recycles the opening posture rather than reweighting it, so the Resonant Reconfiguration test is not satisfied with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when are scattered across the first ~200 words without clean anchoring, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—Marcus feeling passion instead of shame—lacks visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no tactical change shown. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (grief layered through objects and memory), but the final beat offers emotional uplift without the density shift or felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence makes the price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who (Elara), where (study), and when (after spirit departs) arrive early enough, but the piece is a single unbroken expository block with no scene pressure or causal linkage—pure summary of background, objects, and aspirations. No on-page closure: the story ends mid-setup with Elara boarding a vessel; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The "quest" is announced but never tested, leaving no felt cost or transformed option. Drive lens is indeterminate because no pressure accumulates and no beat turns.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where anchored, but "after tomorrow disappears" remains unexplained and non-functional). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but delivers no decisive tightening or cost: the cycle completes as it always does, the librarian emerges "entirely new" without dramatized friction, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a closure image with felt price. The smelting ritual and tidal immersion occur without complication, opposition, or stakes-testing. No before/after is legible—the librarian's stance and situation are unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is beyond "inspector," where the surface world is, and when this occurs remain vague past the 120-word mark (−0.4). The closure—donning the crown and returning to help others—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not legible in a specific trade-off or foreclosed path; the inspector gains power without visible sacrifice. Causality is weak: the pearl "chooses" her and the crown "transforms" without motivated linkage to prior decisions. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (crystal imagery, confessions, hopes), but the final deepening lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: Elena's profession and the brother's accident emerge past the opening third, creating initial fog. The closure unit—playing the accordion beside the underground river—lands as a symbolic tableau rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The river discovery and graffiti clues function as coincidental plot conveniences rather than causally earned turns. Drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (graffiti as texture) and Causal (map references leading to the river), never fully committing, and the ending dissolves into lyric assertion without a legible before/after in Elena's options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "veiled dreamer" at line one but remain spatially unanchored until "edge of a forest" arrives past the 20% mark, violating the ~120-word test without teaching a pattern (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (mist-cipher-library pattern) but no on-page cost appears at closure—the protagonist gains knowledge and departs unchanged, with no visible forfeit or reconfiguration that narrows options. The "second fateful letter" is mentioned as future threat but never materializes, leaving closure conceptually unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and operates under a Causal lens: coffee-reading → decision to propagate → harmonic playing → ice-violin budding in the plant. The closure lands on the page with visible cost (the original violin becomes a "silent shell" with "deep scars") and the empire gets a hollow trophy while the essence survives in the plant. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee stains show destruction unless she acts now, narrowing her options to the propagation tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (skyborne grotto, aurora, Elara at work). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: it layers ritual steps and memory fragments toward a final preservation. However, no meaningful tightening or cost appears—the ritual succeeds without friction, and the ending merely confirms completion rather than reconfiguring stakes. The emerald glows, Elara adds it to a shelf of hundreds, and continues "her timeless work" with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing in intent (preserving sparks before oblivion), but the conceptual cost remains abstract; the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.7)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative deepening is clearly taught by midpoint; the piece drifts between lyric description and summary assertion. Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but the closure unit fails: Elara's final "understanding" is narrated in abstract summary ("not in one place but in embracing all parts") without an on-page decision, renunciation, or image that reweights prior material with legible cost. The protagonist descends "transformed" but no specific action or forfeiture on the page makes the transformation concrete. Applying Orientation waiver (anchors present), but closure remains invalid under all three definitions (DC/RR/CR).

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse, dawn, fisherman). The accumulative lens is signaled by ritual and reflection but the closure—Elian preparing for the next client with a smile—delivers Earned Stasis without visible cost on the page; the final paragraph states his readiness but does not foreclose a path or reveal price paid. Causality is clean within beats: chime selection leads to advice, fisherman accepts. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian "thought he saw something different" in the mirror, but the flicker remains abstract and does not alter his stance in the present frame. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence at closure shows Elian forfeiting an option or bearing a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elien is, where the floating platform sits relative to the grotto, and what "backwards aging" means remain vague past the opening third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Maya mastering "vanishing to appear" and Elien receiving a decade—lands on the page but the cost is abstract; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the "payment for wisdom shared" mechanism is introduced only in the final line without setup. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the teaching structure and stone demonstration), the because/therefore chain breaks: the stone-and-ripples demonstration does not causally enable Maya's transformation; she simply "understands" after the blindfold is removed and the grotto glows.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres into a meaningful tightening or cost. Orientation is delayed: "harmonic stone skimmer" appears first as unexplained role, "Kael" arrives mid-paragraph, and "canyon" setting lacks anchor coordinates until paragraph two; apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4. The arrowhead's "purpose" and the crows' guidance offer no genuine reversal—Kael simply walks to a depression and places the stone, which then pulses. No visible cost, no foreclosed option, no Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending summary ("Kael was gone") tells closure instead of landing it on the page. Closure failure; cap high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative touches; the keystone discovery and unstrapping sequence offer one meaningful turn. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the climactic moment—unstrapping the regulation pack—is summary-compressed ("with deliberate fingers, he began to unstrap each binding") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, dulling the cost and agency. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias returns transformed, the spire subtly changes), but the cost is told ("started as an underachieving mage… ended as a pioneer") rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The portal to the sunken library operates as pure convenience—no earned discovery, no cost to cross, and the librarian waits with pre-packaged answers rather than demanding a trade. The "luminous vow" dissolves into Hemingway's skin as a cosmetic mark with no visible price paid on the page; the ending shows new flame colors but no before/after alteration in Hemingway's options or relationships. Closure reads as reward without renunciation, failing the cost-legibility test for Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Loran's declaration that the universe will "fold inward to begin again"—lands on the page, but the cost is invisible: no choice was at stake, no option foreclosed, no price paid. The backwards prophecy and coin pattern are set-ups without causal payoff; the spiral formation conveniently delivers the answer. The story reads as declarative summary of a ritual rather than a tightening sequence of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the reaper moves through memory and naming without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—naming transforms isolation into purpose—but the cost remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed or tactic visibly altered. The piece signals orientation (reaper, observatory, dusk, post-recordings) within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs (naming ritual at midpoint), though the final image ("names for the future") declares rather than dramatizes the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The closure unit—bell rebuilt, balance restored—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not viscerally felt; the mage simply succeeds without a visible price or foreclosed path. The drive lens reads as Causal (problem → solution), but the link between understanding dripping rates and reconstructing the bell with "intention" is asserted rather than dramatized with tactical narrowing. The final image of warming powers and returning fish offers mild resonance but lacks the undeniable pressure required for RR or the felt sacrifice required for DC.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (warden, ridgeway, reservoir). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details layer (wind chime → label → photographs → aunt's image) toward a conceptual repricing where Thomas reframes his role from complicit manager to truth-teller. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing his new stance in the final dawn image. However, the cost is asserted ("expunge the false narrative") rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or friction on the page, and the phone-call resolution is summarized, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Causal (ritual steps) but reads more like Accumulative description without a decisive change at closure. The ending delivers cosmic approval ("waterfall intensified," "starlings formed the exact shape") rather than a choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The "before the final transformation" frame is repeated three times but never pays off on the page, leaving closure unearned and the cost invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive slowly and remain vague past 120 words; "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" and "pattern seeker" are high-concept labels without spatial grounding. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative phrasing ("another night," "timeless echo," recurrent buckle mentions) suggests textural mode, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure. The ending transmission is declared urgent but we never see the cost paid or a tactical option foreclosed on the page; closure reads as duty fulfilled rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Maya is, where the dojo floats, and what "rewrite of history" means remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit—Maya finding purpose as a "bridge between opposites"—is asserted in the penultimate paragraph without on-page cost or a legible before/after in her options. The "vivify" action succeeds because the text declares it does ("the jar glowed"), not because prior causality narrows her choices or forecloses a path. Drive lens is ambiguous: the story gestures at Causal (Maya channels vitality) but resolves via summary statement, undermining closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first third. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sound builds, the ritual continues, and the giggle returns a charged moment. However, the giggle's appearance lacks causal grounding in Silas's modulation choices; it arrives as coincidence rather than earned resonance, weakening the closure's felt cost. The before/after shift registers emotionally but not causally, placing this in Resonant Reconfiguration territory with ambiguous cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive but "feral library guardian" and "frozen garden in mist" remain vague placeholders past the 120-word threshold without concrete spatial grounding or teaching a disorientation pattern that pays off. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative imagery competes with a causal pendant-power arc, yet neither coheres into a legible closure. The ending claims transformation ("stepped forward," "transformed into another page") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the guardian's state shifts are asserted rather than dramatized. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price of this ending legible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when are not anchored by ~120 words, instead floating in atmospheric description. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is summary-only: "first attempt," "second attempt," and "final ritual" are reported rather than dramatized, flattening causal linkage. Closure nominally lands (crozier transforms), yet the cost is asserted ("hope that had seemed so elusive") rather than legible on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The successive approximation method appears late and resolves the problem it did not help create, weakening earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a pattern of cosmic connection building toward alignment. Closure occurs on the page (fragment aligns, city awakens) but the cost remains abstract—no concrete choice, forfeiture, or visible price emerges in the final beats. The ending summarizes understanding gained ("knowledge that every conclusion contains the seed") rather than landing a felt consequence. Orientation anchors are present early, but the tuning process itself is conveyed through summary and intention rather than specific causal steps that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern and imagery accumulation), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—beats simply stack without reweighting stakes or narrowing options. The grotto arrival and hourglass-filling sequence offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the "miracle" is asserted, not earned. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague (multiple timelines, spectral grotto mechanics unexplained). The ending declares wholeness without demonstrating what Liam forfeited or how the merger altered his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (Elias, gallery, dream-weaving work) but the closure unit—the sister appearing in a shared fever dream—arrives without causal preparation; she vanished "years ago" but no prior beat shows Elias discovering a pathway or paying a cost that makes this reunion legible. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in theory (connection created through weaving), but the cost is asserted ("stronger than ever") rather than shown as a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of dream-weaving deepens until eruption), but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it declares victory without on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The piece unfolds causally: Kael's curiosity → scavenging → chain link discovery → edge geometry development → breakthrough confirmation → presentation to students. However, the climactic "breakthrough morning" is summarized in a single sentence with no on-page dramatization of the moment when ships return or how Kael learns his calculations match theirs. The closure unit reads as Decisive Change (his method is validated and adopted), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed path appears on the page. The lens is Causal, and it holds, but the ending delivers validation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.2)
    Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the reframed photograph, but the predator interception resolves via security personnel off-page, externalizing the decisive change. The grandmother's "decades-old concern" being "transformed" is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The causal link—grandmother's photograph capturing the same man—strains credulity and feels retrofitted to manufacture closure rather than earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors appear by the end of the first paragraph (who, where). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, fragments of backstory, and ritual gestures toward a final image of sacred silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara completes the ritual and commits to return—but the cost is asserted ("claustrophobia had subsided," "profound sense of purpose") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price. The tidal window provides a structural constraint, yet no on-page moment dramatizes what she risks or loses by staying.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—"digital consciousness," "opal observatory," and the timeline are asserted without spatial or temporal anchoring that would allow the reader to track who is where and when. The closure unit (making coffee, understanding failure as transformation) appears on the page but the cost is abstract and declared rather than felt; no live option is visibly foreclosed by this realization. The drive lens wobbles between accumulative (ink patterns, heartbeats) and causal (defragment process) without teaching a coherent pattern or holding steady at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cost occurs on the page—thirty years of failure resolve in one convenient bird-pattern without prior setback or trade-off. The closure beat ("his life's work was complete") is asserted, not dramatized; no before/after options are legible. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives cleanly in paragraph one. The diamond's glow and the emerging sentence occur without visible price or foreclosed alternative, reducing closure to wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of observations and celestial alignments building toward thematic resonance). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but "after the missing return changed everything" remains vague past the 120-word mark, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "witness rather than capture" realization, but cost is conceptual and diffuse—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt pressure. The arrowhead's luminous patterns and celestial connection are intriguing setup but don't constrain a final choice or reweight prior material with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes who, where, and when by the opening lines, avoiding orientation debt. However, the drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (orchard imagery, music transforming the world) and Causal (Elayn's quest), never fully committing. The closure—vines climbing, world changing, people dreaming—unfolds as a montage summary rather than a single decisive image with legible cost. The resonant reconfiguration is asserted ("beauty was reawakening") but not dramatized in a moment where we see what Elayn has lost or what option she has foreclosed. Under either lens, the ending tells us transformation has occurred without showing the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (mailman, arcade, twilight, disputed territory) arrive early. The piece attempts accumulative pressure—Elias carries the bottle all day, navigates guard checkpoints, completes the handoff—but the stakes remain abstract; no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. The closure gesture (woman disappears with the bottle, Elias walks away lighter) offers a moment of relief but lacks visible cost or a decisive change that reweights prior material. The final paragraphs summarize future reunions and thematic meaning rather than landing a charged image, pushing closure into tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a causal turn when the carpenter sings), but the closure—carousel horses coming to life and the carpenter working "anew"—delivers spectacle without legible cost or constraint. The halo fragment's mechanics remain unexplained conveniences; it pulses, beckons, resonates, then dissolves, serving as a magic wand rather than a pressure point with trade-offs. The "wrong turn" arrives without setup or consequence, and the oasis discovery does not narrow options or force a choice—it simply grants wishes. Orientation is clean early, but the causal chain from fragment to song to carousel animation reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough, though "three in the morning" anchors time while "patrons browse" creates mild temporal confusion. Under an Accumulative lens, the hyperbolic geometry configuration builds toward a RR (Margaret connects permanently to the stories), but the cost is conceptual and heavily asserted ("scarf dissolved into particles," "purpose fulfilled") rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The link between arranging books and the "reawakening" relies on telling ("stories took physical form") rather than motivated causality, and the final image—returning to her desk with the scarf "stitched into her very soul"—is metaphorical summary rather than a legible before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (Elara, library, predawn shift). The piece follows a two-shard mosaic (library discovery → sunrise capture → studio revelation), but the causal lens weakens at closure: the mysterious book appears conveniently without prior setup, and the sister's transformation is explained rather than dramatized through Elara's choices. The final image offers Conceptual Repricing—understanding the sister's presence in light—but the cost is emotional acknowledgment rather than a decision that forecloses options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural through most beats but attempts a causal turn at the end without sufficient pressure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: the "crossroads" and "shadowed nexus" float without geographic anchor, and the woman's identity and the nature of her imprisoned idea remain generic. The piece announces metaphysical mechanics (clockwise circle, first star hint) but does not dramatize a concrete decision that narrows options. The ending dissolves the lock of hair "into starlight" and walks away, offering a summary ("Another heart unlocked") rather than a visible cost or a before/after that the reader can verify on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (ritual layering, star-and-hair motifs), but closure is asserted, not shown through a charged image or a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through constellations, fairy ring, decades of research converging), and the piece teaches this lens early. However, closure lacks felt cost: Elara "stood, whole again" with no trade-off, no price paid for the decades lost or the self she was before. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("folklore wasn't just story but memory made tangible") rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, flattening what could have been a resonant reconfiguration into convenient restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative pattern-building plus causal mentorship stakes). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (archivist, library, morning). The closure—Prisha standing her ground and continuing work—reads as Earned Stasis with the archivist's recognition of purpose, but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what price the archivist pays in this moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Prisha absorbs the lesson, yet the reversible-exile technique demonstration feels more like exposition than a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The drive lens remains ambiguous: the piece gestures toward lyric accumulation but delivers a linear ritual sequence without causal pressure or meaningful reversal. The closure unit—placing the transformed seed in a pouch and waiting for others—lacks on-page decisive change or visible cost; the pruner's state and options are identical before and after the ritual. The final paragraphs summarize future possibility rather than landing a felt reconfiguration or repricing in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elena's internal repair through the act of unraveling the net. The cost is present but light—"one tiny section of her own damage repaired"—and the spirits settling feels more told than shown. Orientation is prompt (paragraph 1), and the lens holds, but the closure's emotional weight doesn't fully land because the net's unraveling happens too smoothly without friction or setback. The ending reweights her attribute from burden to gift, qualifying as RR, but the shift feels asserted rather than earned through dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words; no penalty applied. The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing: Elara's realization that the henge is a celestial phenomenon shifts from physical reopening to understanding sacred silence. However, the cost is abstract—"inviting others to experience the wonder without stripping away the mystery"—without an on-page forfeiture or constraint that alters her options. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silent footage → discovery), but the final "reweighting" occurs via exposition rather than image or enacted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation adequately (underwater library, Amelia Earhart context, snow globe). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection and the snow globe's shifting meaning rather than causal linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final realization reweights Amelia's transmission and Elara's quest, but the cost—Elara's grief, the mystery's dissolution—is asserted more than dramatized on the page. The snow globe's unexplained physical change (plane vanishing) introduces a late rule without prior anchoring, weakening causal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive reasonably early, but the ethereal realm lacks grounding rules—floats above clouds, exists "between lightning and thunder" without physics or access logic. No on-page causality: Elara finds the staircase during a storm (told), discovers the plate in an attic (told), then uses it successfully without friction. The ending asserts "harmony" and "silent song" but no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration occurs on the page. Drive lens is ambiguous (lyric accumulation attempted but no pressure tightens). Applying Q2 penalties: orientation debt −0.3, no legible closure unit −1.0, lens ambiguity −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear timeframe structure (floor-by-floor ascent), and the ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing when the goggles reveal the encrypted text and Elira internalizes the captain's dual existence. However, the orientation test shows friction: "who" and "where" are anchored early, but the "when" (relationship to the captain's disappearance timeline) remains hazy until floor eight's retroactive clarification. Cost is stated abstractly ("化作 a silent promise") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or alteration of her options. The closure reweights prior material, but the price feels asserted rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern or delivers a decisive reconfiguration. The gondola's predicament (broken string, stranded) is declared in the opening but generates no escalating pressure or tactical constraint across the 27 paragraphs. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("she wasn't just memorializing clouds...she was memorializing the very concept of connection itself") but the cost is purely conceptual, never felt or visible on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers discovery (hidden compartment → coin → pattern recognition → final impressions) toward a closure image that reweights Elara's project. Orientation is clean. However, the closure unit—walls shimmering with interlocking patterns—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown: no visible sacrifice, foreclosed option, or price paid on the page. The final pocket-coin moment gestures toward continuity but does not land a decisive change with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors appear promptly (airship, Eli, observation deck). The piece follows a causal chain—Eli sees luminance, examines the board, cross-references the phrasebook, achieves understanding—but the core revelation ("someone had deliberately contained it") lacks groundwork; the reader cannot trace how the hopscotch numbers and phrasebook symbols yield that specific insight. The closure offers a Decisive Change (charting luminous pathways is now his reality), yet the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: no option is visibly foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The lens reads Causal with mild accumulative texture, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric fragments accumulate toward a final restoration image. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elias completes the repair without forfeiture, and the ending ("he had found his place") is asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure. The box opening and heart repair proceed without reversal or tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece infers an Accumulative lens but never teaches a pattern or builds density through reweighted imagery; instead it strings declarative summaries across generations without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the closure—"their strange history continued to blossom"—offers no decisive change, no renunciation with visible cost, and no conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The watering-bell discovery is recounted ("After weeks," "remarkable," "ancient device") rather than dramatized, flattening what should be the central turn. Generations pass in the final third via summary, erasing any chance for on-page pressure or felt consequence at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.7)
    The closure attempt—vouchsafing the lullaby into the clock—unfolds as a described ritual with no visible cost or foreclosed path; Elias completes his task and "the spindle pulsed once, softly, accepting," a passive accommodation that lacks friction or price. Orientation anchors appear late: "doomsday clock adjuster" is named in paragraph one but his role and the lighthouse's function remain abstract until paragraph two, and "time's final ripple" is invoked without concrete stakes or a legible countdown. The drive lens is ambiguous—oscillating between Accumulative (lullaby fragments) and Situational (cosmic mechanism)—and the ending delivers neither a decisive change nor a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; the hush "remained…holding the lullaby safe" is stasis without price. The lack of on-page cost and lens clarity together prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain (discovers nut and blueprint → assembles device → rescues travelers) and orientation anchors are present early. However, the closure lacks felt cost: Elias returns to the orchard feeling "at peace" without any visible price paid or path foreclosed—the curse simply becomes "less oppressive." The device will recharge and be ready for next time, soft-resetting the stakes. The inferred lens is causal, but the final image offers satisfaction without the trade-off or renunciation required for Resonant Reconfiguration or the reweighting needed for Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (ravine, scientist, argument). The piece attempts a causal arc—grief → nature observation → insight → phone call → new approach—but the central turn (calling her sister) arrives through epiphany rather than pressure-driven choice, and the sister's immediate warmth removes cost. The weeks-later coda summarizes rather than dramatizes closure, so the decisive change occurs off-page. Lens reads hybrid-accumulative, but the ending drifts into summary mode without a crisp final image that reweights prior material with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is this vendor? why confined? what does parole mean here?) without teaching a pattern that pays off, triggering −0.4. The closure unit—vendor "finally understood that their long search had ended"—arrives as pure realization with no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the "profound peace" replaces pressure rather than emerging from it. The piece drifts in accumulative-textural mode but never tightens or deepens under that lens; we cycle through static descriptions of moonlight, shards, and glass trees without escalation. Drive lens remains ambiguous (causal? lyric?) past midpoint and at closure, warranting additional −0.3 penalty and cross-category caps per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor by the second paragraph, but "at the close of an unspoken dream" remains opaque past 120 words without payoff at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—Kael emerging "lighter"—lacks visible cost: no tactical forfeit, no foreclosed path, only asserted relief. Under a Causal lens the journey and work do not narrow options or change knowledge in a legible way; under Accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with felt pressure. The pavilion visit reads as a complete success without dramatized sacrifice, violating the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present but delayed; the opening leans heavily on atmospheric description before anchoring Elena's immediate goal. The story operates in summary mode throughout: "Recently, however, Elena's focus had shifted" and "By the fourth meeting" compress key dramatic beats into tell. The closure—Elena holding the weight while humming—offers an image but no decisive change or visible cost; her status at the end is identical to her status at the outset, and the "restored" community is asserted rather than shown through a charged final moment. The causal lens is intermittently present but repeatedly interrupted by thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The piece declares a stake (accessing entangled memories) but the engineer encounters no meaningful obstacle or reversal—activation succeeds immediately and the flood of memories requires no tactical adjustment. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the engineer's permanent change, but no visible cost forecloses a path on the page; "permanently changed" and "purpose unlocked" are asserted without showing what was renounced or lost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image ("quaking reverie of transformed consciousness") recycles earlier phrasing without cadence shift or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and attempts a closure unit (activating the defense systems), but causality is thin: Elara faces no meaningful obstacle or reversal in the grotto—she "works through each puzzle" off-page, and gravity's return provides only time pressure without forcing a trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the sequence reads as and-then steps (collect supplies, enter chamber, touch pedestals, escape) without a because/therefore chain that narrows options. Cost at closure is asserted ("renewed responsibility") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through grove → sculpture → crack-reading → emotional absorption → renewed carving purpose, building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the rediscovered song now guides her next work). Orientation anchors (grove, fog, morning) arrive early. However, the closure lacks a visible on-page cost or foreclosed path; Elara ends exactly where she began—ready to carve—without a meaningful tightening or sacrifice that reweights her options. The "work of redemption began anew" reads as a thematic assertion rather than a dramatized shift with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode with recurring patterns (worry stone, magnetic pulses, notebooks) that build toward a conceptual repricing: acknowledgment rather than sacrifice. However, the closure epiphany ("the mountains didn't want restitution—they wanted recognition") arrives as internal realization without visible cost or altered tactic. The story signals a three-day countdown but the urgency doesn't narrow options on the page; day three merely restates prior reflection. Orientation is clear early (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight), so no penalty applies there, but the conceptual shift at the end feels asserted rather than earned through prior resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraphs. The dominant stake—unlock the diary—is clear, but escalation is absent: Elara arranges tools, strikes forks, and the clasp opens without reversal, complication, or narrowed options. The ending pivot (from cataloging to teaching) is told as realization rather than shown as a choice that forecloses a prior path. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens, but cost is asserted ("shifted...calling") rather than legible in image or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara finds her place), but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page—she gains knowledge, approval, confidence, and community without trade-off. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (doodles deepen, seed reveals, visitors gather), yet no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at the end; the final paragraph merely restates the premise in summary. Orientation is prompt (name, treetop village, dawn) but the "turning of the tide's thought" phrase recurs without clear temporal anchoring. The seed's pulsing and blue-light reveal happen off-pressure; Elara observes rather than acts, and the breakthrough arrives as convenient discovery rather than protagonist-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative window-dressing. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Arion receives visions, understands the arrow's purpose, returns home—lands on the page but the cost is abstract: he gains knowledge without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The broken-arrow reveal at midpoint shifts from ornament to plot key via convenient magic rather than earned causality, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the reader must piece together setting and stakes gradually. The drive lens attempts Situational (investigator in eerie environment) but repeatedly slips into Accumulative-textural with atmospheric cataloging that doesn't escalate pressure. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—Elena simply reviews data and reiterates her goal without on-page cost or altered options. The mass-unconsciousness reveal arrives as exposition in paragraph eight, too late to shape tactics, and the "singular convergence" remains abstract rather than a legible closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening; Eira begins ready to perform, performs without opposition or complication, and achieves the declared outcome without narrowing options or paying a visible cost. The "sculpted hush" unfurls as promised with no dramatized friction. Orientation is clear, but the causal chain is a straight line: preparation → performance → success. The ending offers emotional affect in the crowd but no on-page change in Eira's options, knowledge, or stance—no Decisive Change, Earned Stasis, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second sentence; no penalty. Closure unit: the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Eldrin renounces control and accepts a healing role), but the cost is told rather than shown—"canyon hush remained within him" is asserted mood, not a visible forfeiture or constraint that alters options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (driftwood ritual, sound layering, vision sequences build toward thematic reweighting), yet the escalation consists of repetitive reflective loops rather than a meaningful tightening or cadence shift. The flute's mechanics ("ancient patterns that opened pathways between realms when properly sounded") are declared but never tested or resisted on the page, flattening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story withholds basic orientation anchors (who Elara is, why she invited Thomas, what the halo fragment's mechanics are) past the 120-word mark without teaching a disorientation pattern that pays off; the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4). The closure—Elara alone, continuing her research—lacks decisive change or visible cost; her stance at the end is identical to her stance at the start, and no option has been foreclosed on the page. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal (empathy transfer) but lands in summary-only reflection without pressure tightening or a charged final image. Under any lens, the ending resets to status quo without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece presents a journey-plus-delivery structure but the closure—handing off the pendant and discovering internal confidence—arrives through summary rather than on-page reversal. The stated cost ("hollow space against her chest") is asserted, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a live option. Orientation is adequate (courier, ridgeway, pendant by ~100 words), but the drive lens wavers between causal (delivery mission) and thematic-accumulative (wonder awakening) without committing, and the final paragraph's abstract philosophizing replaces scene pressure. Applying lens-ambiguity penalty and cost-proof deficit.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early). The closure attempt—Elara's realization that "objects didn't just absorb feelings; they preserved moments"—arrives as assertion rather than earned reversal; no prior beat narrows her options or imposes cost. The arbor setup and frost-pattern method appear, but the prism's revelatory turn is told ("she saw flashes," "she realized") without a legible because/therefore chain or a concrete price paid on the page. Drive lens reads hybrid-causal but the ending delivers summary epiphany rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression, but orientation remains vague: Elara's spatial relationship to the orchard, the market's distance, and the journey's temporal window are never anchored concretely (Orientation Test penalty −0.4). The closure—sound returning and Elara "able to weave" sound—lands as a Conceptual Repricing, yet the cost is asserted rather than shown; the bead "reborn on her chest" undercuts the prior claim that it "stopped glowing entirely," creating a soft reset. The puzzle-piece journey introduces a magical mechanic late without prior setup, and causality blurs: why does touching the bead to the bamboo shoot reverse the silence? The lens holds loosely, but the closure image lacks the undeniable cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with clear orientation (who, where, what). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the silk's energy, mine-shaft work, and arch repair accumulate toward a final image of "azure defiance" and "quiet power." However, the closure is told in summary ("his story became legend") rather than landing in a decisive on-page image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The barter's price is named ("his silence, his time, and his very essence") but never dramatized as a constraint that alters later tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test fails: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "sensory map maker" remains vague (no name, no embodied detail) and the repair bay's spatial layout never coheres. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative (reality-fraying, parallel visions), but no meaningful tightening occurs—each jump is a static tour, and the mysterious door appears in the final third without setup, breaking causality. The ending recedes into "half-remembered dreams" with no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the shard goes dim and tomorrow's retry erases present cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes a visible price legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered discoveries (sea glass, letters, stone stacks) deepen the stake and reweight Elias's solitary existence through connection across time. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias joins the chain, accepting fellowship with visible cost (carrying the vial, protecting silence). Orientation anchors early (lighthouse, Elias, supply run). One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the hidden compartment and realizes the tradition's scope. The cost at closure is felt but oblique—he commits to the chain, yet no prior path is dramatized as foreclosed on the page, weakening the before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within tolerance, but causality is weak: Elara's prophetic declaration about twin comets produces no on-page consequence beyond her private realization. The "storm" of refugees resolves via her beam adjustment with no reversal, complication, or cost—she declares an action, it succeeds, she feels elated. No decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing occurs; the final paragraph loops back to the opening ritual without reweighting stakes or options. The piece reads as a static vignette under an unclear lens—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density tightens meaningfully toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no meaningful plot: Kaelen begins researching why people magnetize stories, performs vague experiments, and arrives at an insight without obstacle, reversal, or cost. The "breakthrough" (mixing blue morpho wing dust with dew and sunlight) is told in summary and solves a problem that was never dramatized as urgent or blocked. No on-page closure effect—no decision alters tactics, no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes under pressure. The ending merely describes a future state ("when guests eventually found their way…") rather than landing a present-tense decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered detail (brass gears, sextant, dream fragments, oak board) toward a final crystallization when the sextant "flared" and understanding "washed over Samuel." However, closure lacks visible cost—Samuel gains insight and healing without forfeiting anything or facing a live constraint. The ending reconfigures his purpose ("maintaining the labyrinth... as a sanctuary") but the reconfiguration is asserted rather than dramatized through an on-page action or renunciation that narrows options. The coincidental alignment (condensation droplet striking a tin cup matching a dream frequency) complicates but also resolves, weakening situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates texture through repeated metaphoric motifs (light, weaving, songs) and builds toward the final woven dawn, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the keeper rests as the realm awakens). However, cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page—no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical shift marks the keeper's transformation. The closure reconfigures the realm's state but does not show what the keeper sacrificed or lost to achieve it, reducing felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Eleanor, library, near midnight) and holds a single POV across one continuous scene, satisfying orientation and scope defaults. However, the closure unit—Eleanor's acceptance of her dual nature and the note she writes—lacks visible cost: she neither forfeits a relationship nor faces a consequence that narrows future options. The "revelation" that her absence honors her nature is told rather than dramatized, and the society member's understanding arrives without friction. Under a situational/reflective lens, the piece offers a stance crystallization, but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page, preventing full RR (Charged Poise) qualification.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story opens with vague temporal anchor ("After the birds flew south") and deferred spatial grounding; who, where, and when cohere only after ~150 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Closure lands as a reflective summary ("found her absolution... one small revelation at a time") rather than a decisive on-page change or charged final image with felt cost. The lens reads hybrid-accumulative but drifts into summary mode at the end, weakening cost legibility. The letter revelation is recounted, not dramatized, undercutting causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early enough and maintains spatial coherence. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence should build toward a pattern break or reweighting. However, the closure unit—Elias's hope and renewed measurements—lacks visible or felt cost; the "surge of hope" and faint smile do not foreclose a path or impose trade-off. The ending recapitulates the opening action (sampling frequencies) without deepening stakes or altering options, reading more as thematic echo than Resonant Reconfiguration with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation cleanly (pirate market, daughter of a runner, watch fob key) and pursues a causal chain: Eliza plants lies, Malachi's note exposes the traitor, trust shatters. The closure unit—trust breaking captured in the fob—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than felt; Eliza risks nothing and gains her prize without forfeit, so the "before/after" is more a task completed than a transformation with price. One meaningful tightening occurs (the note reveal), satisfying minimum escalation for this length, but the design leans causal without the pressure or trade-off that would elevate closure into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains unstable past the 120-word mark; "lavender bluff" and "forests holding elections" are offered without spatial or conceptual grounding that the reader can trace. The climactic "transformation" is told in summary ("The transformation began immediately") rather than shown with causal linkage. Closure depends on late-introduced rule ("forest elections select carriers") that the protagonist did not help create, breaking earned causality. Drive lens ambiguous between lyric-accumulative and causal; neither holds cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation arrives by ~120 words (Rhodes descending into the cave). The closure attempt—painting what only his heart demands—is stated rather than shown; no on-page action demonstrates the decisive change or its cost. The "broken combination lock" metaphor is introduced as backstory explanation, not dramatized causality. The final paragraph asserts that Rhodes has "uncorked suppressed creativity" without showing what tactical choice, renunciation, or constraint made that transformation legible on the page. Cost is claimed but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elara discovers fragments, pieces together the map, realizes the two artifacts align, and commits to a journey. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. However, closure is setup rather than change—she packs and resolves to begin at dawn without on-page cost or a decisive shift in her situation. The final paragraph articulates theme and intention but does not dramatize a reversal, renunciation, or reconfiguration with felt consequence; the story ends on the threshold of action rather than after a pivotal choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images (bells, fragment, colors, light) toward a thematic crescendo. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. However, closure fails the cost test—Elara's death produces "a spectrum of colors never before seen," but this is reward, not renunciation or foreclosed path. The narrative summarizes decades in the final third without dramatizing a single pivot where agency narrows options. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the sculpture succeeds effortlessly and the legacy endures unchanged, yielding Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with fragments layering toward transformation, but the closure effect—miniaturization through "controlled burn escape"—lacks visible cost at the moment of change. The original form "slumps inert," yet this consequence is reported after the fact rather than dramatized as a foreclosed option. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening, no penalty. The two-of-three gate test (Resonant Reconfiguration via transformation) is approached but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece teaches an accumulative lens early (courtyard gatherings, fragments of story) but the closure lands as summarized satisfaction ("healing began") rather than a decisive on-page shift. Cost is gestural: Leo "fulfilled his purpose" by reconnecting the community, yet no visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears in the final beat. The mailbox discovery (letters to neighbors) functions as a reveal but does not narrow options or charge the image with felt price. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~100 words; no penalty applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows a causal lens with clear before/after states: Elara begins seeking knowledge, performs the dance ritual, and unlocks the laboratory's secrets. However, the closure—Lydia's materialization and the subsequent "renaissance of discovery"—tells rather than shows the decisive change, summarizing outcomes in the final paragraphs instead of landing a felt cost on the page. The orientation is present (sunken laboratory, Elara's role) but the escalation relies on assertion ("close to liberating") rather than narrowing options through dramatized reversals. The inferred lens holds, but the closure unit lacks immediate, visible cost at the moment of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but the closure lacks felt cost—Elara simply reburries the crystal and resumes her duties with newfound peace, a soft reset rather than a reconfiguration. The whale's beaching three days prior provides temporal anchor, but causality is thin: coffee grounds "indicate" a gravity pocket, she digs, finds the crystal. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the discovery resolves her quest without foreclosing options or altering tactics. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the ending offers relief without price.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~120 words, meeting the baseline test. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the summoner performs a ritual that builds through layered imagery until the origami crane is released. However, no causal because/therefore linkage narrows options—each sentence adds ornament without tightening pressure or foreclosing alternatives. The ending releases the crane "into harmless dissolution," but this decisive change lacks on-page cost; the prophecy simply vanishes without visible sacrifice or tactical price paid by the summoner.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal but wobbles between interpersonal discovery and architectural mystery without clear escalation. Orientation anchors who/where by the second paragraph (acceptable). The closure—Clara receives the seal and gains "fluency"—is declared rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost appears on the page. The "agreed upon lies" setup promises tension but resolves off-page ("some truths need protection") without altering tactics or stakes in the rooftop scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a single ritual action from setup to completion, but causality is thin: Elara arrives already knowing her method and purpose, performs it without obstacle, and succeeds. The "quarantined memories" surface without dramatic friction or choice-point. Closure reads as completion of a predetermined task rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. The "isolation into independence" transformation is declared in the final paragraphs but not earned through on-page reversal or visible cost. Orientation is adequate (velvet garden, twilight, Elara alone with crystals and shell) by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, satisfying the test. The closure unit—writing the addendum and pricking his finger—lands on the page, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete: no guard appears, no village responds, no personal price beyond a lifted weight is legible. The causal chain from receiving the key to unlocking the compartment to writing the confession reads as outline linkage without friction or failed attempt. The drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative coloring (aurora, thorn motifs), but the ending relies on a convenience object (glowing key dissolves, problem solved) that the story did not help create, undercutting earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but "serpentine nexus under starlight" remains abstract; no concrete spatial or temporal markers ground the reader by ~120 words. The closure unit—spirit chooses transformation—occurs on the page but the cost is asserted ("light that was neither star nor sun") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible consequence. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight prior particulars with legible pressure; the shift from melancholy to "quiet understanding" is told, not dramatized. The seashell's progressive disclosure mechanism is mentioned but never enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as causal-accumulative hybrid, but the sequence relies heavily on summary: "Night after night, Elara documented…" compresses what should be the story's escalating pressure. Orientation anchors appear early (diver, shrine, snow globe), satisfying the test. The closure—captain's "Thank you" and the globe now clear—asserts resolution rather than showing a decisive change or cost on the page; the final image reweights prior material only thematically, without visible forfeiture or a crystallized stance that narrows options. No meaningful reversal tightens tactics or knowledge between the wreck-dive and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately and follows an accumulative structure, but it lacks a decisive closure unit with legible cost. The protagonist ends where he began—appreciating hidden patterns—without transformation, renunciation, or a charged crystallization of stakes. The circular journey (cabin → parapet → cabin) delivers atmosphere but no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge. The final paragraph's "comfort in hidden patterns" reads as thematic summary rather than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story summarizes nearly all pivotal discoveries rather than dramatizing them: the letter reassembly, the stillpoint revelation, and the corporate conspiracy are recounted in past-tense exposition. Orientation is delayed—who Maya is, where she is specifically, and when this occurs remain vague past the opening. The closure offers no decisive change or visible cost; Maya's choice to "become the keeper" is stated intent, not an on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a path. The inferred lens is unclear: causal linkage is weak (discoveries happen off-page), and no accumulative pattern is taught early enough to justify the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the story summarizes Elias watching history unfold "according to frequencies he alone had first interpreted" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that lands with felt cost in the final image. The piece reads as extended exposition across years with no single scene window or tight causal linkage—only a retrospective catalog. Orientation is delayed; we learn "floatstone mountain" and "seven years" but no immediate stake or present-tense pressure emerges by ~120 words. The lens remains ambiguous (neither causal turns nor accumulative pattern-teaching nor situational crystallization coheres), violating the Drive Lens Rule and triggering Q2 cap at 7.2 and cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the poet gathers sounds, discovers the music box, captures its essence, and shares it at the senior center. Orientation anchors are present early (feral loft, dawn, dunes), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks visible cost—the music bridges generations smoothly with no dramatized sacrifice, resistance, or foreclosed path. The final paragraph summarizes thematic success rather than landing a decisive image or reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Causal with attempts at mystical-technical fusion. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (engineer, marina, lighthouse). The closure unit—artifact protected, intruders expelled—occurs on the page, but cost is absent: Elias completes the ritual, the bad guys scream and drift away, and he ascends "forever changed" without specifying what path was foreclosed or what price he paid. The tuning fork/vibrational frequency mechanism arrives late and resolves a problem it didn't help create. Because/therefore linkage is present in the approach sequence but the climax delivers a convenient sonic weapon with no dramatized tradeoff or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, mapper at window). However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The story ends with the mapper feeling satisfaction and imagining future outcomes; the "patient revolution" remains a plan rather than a turn that narrows options or imposes cost. The accumulative lens is signaled by moon-path tracking and magnetic resonance, but the final image ("patience, once sculpted, would stand as humanity's greatest achievement") asserts theme without reweighting prior material through action or a charged callback that transforms the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Maya discovers fresh scratches, opens the lantern, finds the note, and decides to expose corruption. Orientation is adequate (investigator, tunnel, post-flood). However, the closure choice—submitting findings tomorrow—lacks immediate felt cost; the career threat and supervisor's reaction remain off-page promises. The note's dual function (historical escape route + modern corruption evidence) is convenient rather than earned through Maya's investigation tactics. One meaningful tightening occurs when she opens the lantern, but the final image of "tucking evidence into her case" with a smile softens the stakes rather than charging them with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches a reflective lens early and the final image—the silent heart as louder testimony—offers a conceptual repricing, but the closure arrives through extended exposition rather than a decisive on-page action or crystallized stance. The priest's realization that "justice had been served" and his purchase of a house for Grant's ex-wife are told in summary, undercutting the felt cost. Orientation is clean and the causal chain (Grant's last words → finding the ex-wife → heart stops → decision to leave it broken) is traceable, but the lack of scene pressure at the climax flattens the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The piece follows a quest structure: glider seeks bell → finds arrow tip → translates symbols via kaleidoscope → locates bell → rings it. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the bell rings "as predicted," the glider feels satisfaction, and the algorithm recalibrates for the next goal without any path foreclosed or price paid. The ending image ("infinite versions of itself, all seeking") gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Under a Causal lens the chain is legible but consequences are absent; under Accumulative the final cadence does not shift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors do not stabilize until well past 120 words; "corporate memory keeper" and "vast social network archive" remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding. Closure effect is absent on the page—Elara downloads files and "disappears into the city's underground network" without a decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material with felt cost. The piece ends on declared intent ("ready to uncover") rather than an action or image that demonstrates before/after change. Drive lens reads as intended Causal but the "realization dawned" beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, and the final move (downloading, fleeing) does not narrow options or foreclose a path in a way legible as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elena is and what immediate problem she faces doesn't anchor until ~180 words into the orchard scene. The closure unit (crystal reconstitution) occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual only: "courageously anomalous" is asserted rather than felt as a social or relational price. Causality is threadbare: the mirrors are mentioned as having been visited "three times that week," but their glimpses never constrain her present tactics; the crystal simply reforms "as if pulled from between moments in time." The drive lens appears Causal by default but the because/therefore linkage is soft—motivation ("save their settlement from the coming storm") → method (shadow magic + mirror glimpses) → success, with no earned reversal or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with disorienting abstraction ("waking up changed") that remains unexplained past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. No causal linkage connects Elena's volunteering to her internal shift; the ending epiphany ("change doesn't always mean loss") arrives via assertion rather than earned pressure. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual only—no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing makes the transformation legible. Drive lens appears Accumulative but the final cadence shift lacks concrete constraint or price.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.7)
    The piece anchors who and where early (sentinel, pavilion, autumn) but provides no meaningful escalation or closure with cost. The narrative loops through variations of the same reflective stance—he observes couples, fingers the letter, reflects on patterns—without a decisive change, earned stasis with visible price, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The accumulative design never tightens or deepens; the final paragraph ("found his calling") summarizes a theme rather than delivering an on-page moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with felt consequence. Under any lens, the closure unit is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres: ritual steps are listed without deepening pressure or cadence shift. Orientation debt persists past 120 words—who this person is, what specific threat "the coming silence" poses, and why *tonight* matters remain vague. No on-page closure: the story ends with the line walker sensing "the next place," a promise of continuation rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The ritual's completion changes nothing legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, what the photographs contain, and why this gathering matters emerge slowly through exposition rather than anchored early action. The story follows an accumulative design, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the ritual proceeds without reversal, and the final circle is a summation, not a turn with visible cost. The phrase "another piece of the great puzzle had been solved" summarizes closure rather than dramatizing it. Under any lens, the ending lacks on-page cost or a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or demonstrates meaningful tightening. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge slowly across the opening third without deliberate disorientation paying off at closure (−0.4). The ending offers a conceptual shift ("preservation → translation") but the cost remains abstract and unfelt; no visible forfeiture or altered tactic marks the change. The crystal's "pure tone" moment gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks on-page consequence that would make before/after legible with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where adequately early, though "amid the fog sculpture garden" in the opening line is slightly vague. The core action—locating the sound of growing older—moves through driftwood arrangement, chalk drawing, and auditory discovery, but causality remains loose: the caretaker's revelation about her grandmother's voice feels coincidental rather than earned by the prophet's prior choices. The ending recycles the opening action (arranging driftwood for the journey home) without a legible change in options or knowledge, blurring whether a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration has occurred. Cost is asserted ("he had finally located what he had spent his life searching for") but not concretely shown in a forfeited path or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the cameras now capture phenomena beyond the visible spectrum—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible on the page. Orientation anchors appear by ~120 words (lunar observatory, Elara, tremors). Causality is loose: the spinning hand's message unfolds through contemplation rather than because/therefore linkage, and the solution (tuning perception filters) emerges from offstage meditation rather than on-page tactical narrowing. One tightening occurs (hand slows as she adjusts equipment), but the stakes never visibly narrow options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the vinyl fragment returning to charge the final image. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the son holding the vinyl "as if it's a holy relic" reweights the broken object's meaning), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no tactical path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The piece teaches a reflective, lyric mode early and holds it, but the ending reconfiguration feels thematically declared ("reunification isn't about physical presence") rather than earned through a protagonist decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit is a conceptual realization ("They go nowhere and everywhere") paired with a decision to follow, but the cost is abstract—no path is foreclosed, no tactic altered. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive early, but causality is thin: the key unlocks a map, Elara connects rune stones in sequence, light erupts, answer appears. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the escalation reads as procedural checklist (stone one, stone two, final loop) without meaningful narrowing of options or a trade-off that charges the ending. The phrase "journey was only beginning" signals an off-page future rather than delivering an on-page change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (garden imagery, tooth motif, bone-setting ritual accumulate toward a conceptual repricing of reality). Closure occurs on-page: Eleanor touches Arthur, boundaries soften, "constellation they would become together" reweights her skepticism with felt cost (certainty lost). However, the Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive past ~120 words (hedge maze, Wembley estate, secret garden sequencing is diffuse). The cost is legible but soft—loss of skepticism is asserted more than shown in a concrete forfeiture. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (star watcher, grotto, nightly climbs). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: polishing rituals deepen into shared gatherings, and the final paragraph reconfigures her earthbound state from restriction to unique vantage. However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page choice forecloses a live option or exacts visible price; the transformation is told in summary ("didn't seem like a restriction anymore"). Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is legible at the ending beat, triggering −0.6 in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (moss/servers, spiral/grief, amber/guilt) and the final offering reconfigures the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who and where early enough; the timeframe ("weeks since," "that morning") is clear. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the pendant left behind, guilt transformed into living moss months later), but the cost is largely told in the final paragraph rather than felt in the present moment of the offering. The spiral pattern is mentioned as a method but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page; it functions more as thematic decoration than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.8)
    No on-page closure unit exists—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The protagonist begins at peace with his manuscript and ends at peace; "conflicted" is asserted in the opening but never dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The "whisper of closing pages" timeframe promises imminent action, but the entire piece remains reflective summary without a causal turn or pressure point. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (mist, nexus, and seashell introduced without spatial or temporal anchor until paragraph three), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric design with recurring images). Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and what her community values remain vague past the 120-word mark, applying −0.4. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final dawn/vine callback, but cost is asserted rather than shown: no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "work" montage compresses all escalation into summary, and the climax delivers success without friction. The ending recycles the opening image ("verdant arbor at dawn") but does not reweight it with visible loss or change.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation arrives slowly: setting anchors appear early but the protagonist's immediate goal and threat remain vague until midpoint ("translate heartbeats into maps...guide humanity through the coming darkness"). Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative atmosphere dominates until a sudden causal leap in the final paragraph where placing flash-paper triggers transformation without prior complication or reversal. The closure (starlight captured, map created, hope reborn) occurs entirely off protagonist agency; no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization is dramatized. Cost is absent: the pattern simply works, the orchard glows, "the world could finally exhale" with no visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive past 120 words without deliberate pattern payoff (−0.4). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs; Elara maps reflections for weeks in summary, then the timer simply works. Closure lacks visible cost—the "harvest" succeeds without sacrifice, trade-off, or consequence. The "wounded season" remains metaphorical decoration rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test; Q1 and Q5 capped at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who the weaver is, where exactly they are, and what the burdens are remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens, but closure lacks visible cost—the weaver's acceptance of their role is asserted ("boundary-lessly connected") rather than paid for on the page. The repeated burden-collection beats do not escalate or tighten options; they cycle without meaningful deepening until the final paragraph's summary.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (skylight loft, rain, carving blank, widow). The accumulative/textural lens holds: layered images of rain, carving, and memory build toward the final constellation moment that reweights "here and gone" with conceptual cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the menagerie on the mantel and the new carving crystallize her method of holding loss differently. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; we're told she has transformed grief but see no on-page moment where something is genuinely forfeited or a live option rejected. The kettle framing hints at time pressure but never tightens tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Cyrus is, where exactly he stands, and what the carousel's halt means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The drive lens is ambiguous—early beats suggest Causal (scavenging for the wheel to unlock the past), but the ending dissolves into Accumulative/lyric imagery (light, merging, the carousel restarting) without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure hinges on the ghost accepting the wheel, but no on-page cost is legible: Cyrus simply declares readiness, extends the wheel, and the ghost forgives. The final image ("liquid peace," "unforeseeable new beginnings") asserts transformation without showing what Cyrus sacrificed or how his options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (abandoned terminal, Maya, carnival left). The inferred lens is Causal-leaning Accumulative: Maya explores → finds sextant → reaches power center → restores lights → discovers equations. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terminal comes back to life and Maya sees new possibilities, but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice, forfeiture, or foreclosed path. The final paragraph asserts hope and future trajectory without dramatizing what was risked or lost to achieve this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the first 120 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring images (crystals, bear, petrichor) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias rediscovers his dream. The closure unit is present—he turns toward home with "renewed purpose"—but the cost is implied rather than shown; we don't see what he forfeits or what new constraint now binds him. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places the sealed watch before the crystals, though the causal link between that gesture and his transformation remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (canal, barge, journal) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph, avoiding penalty. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing: Elara gains understanding and commits to future work, reweighting her grandfather's legacy. However, the cost is asserted ("work was just beginning") rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The accumulative pattern is clean but the final image does not carry undeniable pressure or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, snow, and knot imagery recur, and the final image reweights the rope as connection to ancient wisdom. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the collector departs with rope and glass, the fog parting to reveal "a path forward." Cost, however, is asserted rather than legible: no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no trade-off surfaces on the page. The fisherman's shift from grunt to gift feels timed rather than caused by the protagonist's patience. The "hours" of silent contemplation compress to a single paragraph without dramatized friction, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the traveler begins writing his own obituary, moving from observer to participant), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page action or forfeiture that alters later options. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode (density of reflection, cadence shift at the end), but the final image restates theme without undeniable pressure or visible price. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and moves through assembly → activation → failure → renewed resolve. However, the closure hinges on a private epiphany ("true beauty couldn't be assembled") delivered as interior monologue rather than dramatized reversal, yielding a Conceptual Repricing that feels told more than shown. The causal chain is present (he assembles, it glows, it fades, he understands) but the felt cost remains diffuse—"determination replacing despair" names a shift without foreclosing a prior path on the page. Under a causal lens the linkage holds; the cost is conceptual but not viscerally legible at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with reasonable spatial anchors but the drive lens remains ambiguous—causal links are weak (fire advances, Maya wraps plants, fire stops without clear reason), and accumulative design is not taught early. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Maya's grafts survive without cost or choice that forecloses a path. The ending recycles the opening's symbolic language ("scars can sing," obsidian lagoon) without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible with felt cost. Closure does not land on the page with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, why she alone pursues this, and what the city's current state means remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (breadcrumbs → box → memories → fountains), but escalation is flat—each step simply happens in sequence with no narrowing of options or visible cost. Closure lands (memories freed, fountains flow), yet the cost is invisible: Elara suffers no forfeiture, and the box dissolves without friction. The "defiant hush" and starlight breadcrumbs feel ornamental rather than constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the piece offers only thematic repetition without meaningful intensification or cadence shift. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the being simply completes its mission as described in paragraph one, then returns home. The phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" recurs four times without reweighting prior material or charging the final image. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (first concrete anchor arrives around line 4–5), but the disorientation does not pay off at closure, triggering the Orientation Test penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.9)
    Orientation is delayed—"greenhouse," "gravestone carver," and "spectral mentor" appear early but spatial and temporal anchors remain vague past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (butterfly migration, poem ritual, ribbon as motif) but the accumulation never tightens: Elias walks, unspools ribbon, returns, and carves without a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The closure unit—villagers viewing the completed monument—is summarized ("drawn by rumors," "touched by something vast") rather than dramatized, and no felt cost is legible on the page. The inferred lens does not cohere at the ending, and the final paragraph delivers theme-claim rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens with spatial anchors (obsidian ridge, clock tower) but the orientation is literary rather than logistically clear—"沉重的" (untranslated Chinese) appears in the opening line, creating momentary confusion. The closure—townspeople helping and the clock restarting—delivers a Decisive Change with community involvement as the visible shift, but the causality is weak: inscriptions on a rake handle conveniently guide Alaric to the exact realization needed, and the townsfolk emerge without resistance or friction once he calls. The Drive Lens reads Causal by intent but executes as thematic declaration; the because/therefore chain from "broken rake handle → inscriptions → community gathering → repair" lacks motivated opposition or cost that narrows options. The ending's felt cost is gestural—Alaric's pride softens—but the material stakes (tower structure, town time) resolve off-page through collective montage.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who and where early (cemetery gardener, cobalt silo) and establishes a clear situational frame: monthly ritual after the chess clock counts down. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias discovers the tapestry encodes sacrifice rather than romance and returns it to the case with the knowledge that "love, in all its forms, was the most persistent echo of all." However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the text does not show what Elias loses, risks, or forfeits by this realization, nor does it constrain his next action beyond resetting the clock for another month. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of detail, pattern of monthly ritual, thematic reweighting), but the final image does not meaningfully narrow options or charge prior material with undeniable pressure—it broadens into platitude. The piece teaches its pattern (artifact collection, ritual decoding, monthly cycle) but the closure effect remains more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, but no meaningful escalation or reversal occurs. The piece opens with Elara ready to write, describes her methods and past successes in summary, then ends with her writing—a straight line without tightening options or altering knowledge. The closure unit (pen meeting page) lacks felt cost; she is "satisfied" without visible forfeit or friction. Under any inferred lens, the ending delivers procedural completion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the story opens with generic work, then introduces the radio, then the alcove (which contradicts "her small apartment"), creating spatial confusion that never fully resolves. The dominant lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the final paragraph asserts thematic satisfaction ("reawakening the imagination") without on-page cost or a before/after moment. The second half is pure backstory summary (seven-year famine, dust discovery, listener methods) that halts forward pressure entirely. No causal turn or meaningful tightening appears; the broadcast simply ends and she walks home.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The rocking chair's cessation frames an opening hook, and the final lines attempt Conceptual Repricing via the "continuous process of becoming" realization. However, the middle accumulates description and reflection without meaningful deepening; no on-page reversal narrows options. Cost is implied but not felt—no tactic changes, no foreclosed path. The closure reads as thematic summary rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (Milo, sewers, post-plague Poseidonis) arrive early. The piece accumulates detail but lacks a meaningful tightening or turn: Milo finds the cog, reflects on Council dogma, and decides to preserve it—a decision predetermined by his established philosophy. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost; the "agonize" beat is told rather than dramatized. Closure reads as Charged Poise (tomorrow he will continue), but the final image does not reconfigure prior pressure—it restates the opening stance with no felt trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece is a multi-year summary, not a scene or two-shard window—it violates Track B/C structure without teaching a legible pattern or maintaining one contiguous pressure window. Closure is purely summarized ("legacy," "transformation," "reborn") with no decisive on-page change, no felt cost, and no before/after tension. Causality is outline-level: "through months of practice" and "by spring" compress all pressure into exposition, leaving no tightening moment visible. The Drive Lens remains uninferable because no single stake is tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (greenhouse, Elias, celestial night). The piece establishes a situational frame—planting under cosmic alignment—but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Elias intends to plant, walks through reflection, then plants. The closure (seed in soil, smile, collection of tools) offers Charged Poise in theory, but the cost is asserted ("something important had been accomplished") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Under a Situational lens, the stance crystallization is weak; under Causal, linkage is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately and offers a causal chain (blackout → beehive failure → sabotage reveal → confrontation). However, the closure unit—Elara's smile as "involuntary honesty finally serving as a bridge"—lacks visible cost or a decisive change in her options; the supervisor's confession and the bureau's repair happen around her without her agency altering the outcome. The final image asserts thematic resolution ("bridge between wonder and routine") without dramatizing what Elara has foreclosed or gained. Under a Causal lens, the ending summarizes theme rather than landing a felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: anchors arrive late—"Aria Emerson" not named until line 1, town setting vague, "last Tuesday" creates timeline confusion against "three mornings" and "this morning." The closure unit is an epiphany ("Aria understood") followed by unchanged continuation of her walks, offering reconfiguration without visible cost or foreclosed path. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sensory detail, poetic recursion) but the ending supplies a causal explanation ("shard of hush allowed her to hear") that contradicts the lens, creating ambiguity at closure. No meaningful tightening: the three-morning ritual and final placement do not narrow options or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within acceptable range. The dominant lens reads as accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the statue explains, the diver listens, the ampoule releases visions, and understanding arrives without narrowing options or forcing a stance. The "cascading revelations" are summarized lecture rather than pressure that changes tactics. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (diver gains understanding), but the cost is asserted ("better questions") not dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or constrained choice results from the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure—rolling dice at a bar after escaping—lands on the page but the cost is invisible: Elias laughs and bets with "genuine hope," experiencing only relief rather than any trade-off or foreclosed path. The causal spine (climb → proofs → rupture → return) functions as outline rather than because/therefore linkage; the "fracture point" and "final sequence" are asserted conveniences. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The drive lens reads as attempted Causal but the mathematical breakthrough arrives unearned, making closure feel like a reset button rather than a transformation with price.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    No inciting incident, reversal, or tightening occurs; the painter paints from start to finish without a complication that narrows options. The ending delivers summary satisfaction ("her hope vindicated before anyone even saw her work") that bypasses on-page cost or consequence. Orientation is delayed—greenhouse location and the painter's physical state arrive late, and "smog-choked city" repeats without spatial grounding. The piece reads as a thematic essay with illustrative action rather than causally linked beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" (museum guide) and "where" (grotto city) emerge gradually, "when" (after beekeeper's last visit) arrives late, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—bread and lens triggering the thaw—arrives on the page, but the causal chain is weak: the emerald lens reveals "dormant life force" and "cultural memory" through assertion rather than earned discovery. The lens's mechanics (why it attunes to bee energies, how it directs starter) are convenience shortcuts. Lens ambiguity past midpoint (blending mystical, cultural, and physical modes without a taught pattern) warrants −0.4; the dominant mode at closure reads Causal but rests on unearned magic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (Esme, rocky shore, lighthouse, low tide). The drive lens reads as Causal with symbolic overlay: Esme solves the yoyo puzzle, unlocks radiance, and "steps beyond fate's design." However, the closure effect is asserted rather than shown—"the world revealed itself not as a fixed construct but as fluid potential" is a thematic declaration without a decisive on-page action or visible cost that reweights prior stakes. The yoyo mechanism "clicked into place" but no causal consequence follows that alters Esme's options or forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (abandoned funhouse, post-resuscitation, moonlight) arrive early, but the causal chain fractures immediately: paramedics revive the protagonist "moments before" yet the funhouse visit unfolds as a long sequence with no spatial or temporal grounding. The advisor materializes without setup, the dream dictionary appears from a pocket with no prior mention, and the opera cloak clasp "dissolves into light" then "materialized in my hand one last time" in defiance of prior physics. The ending offers a conceptual repricing ("curse revealed as gift") but the cost is declared, not shown—no on-page action or image where a live option is foreclosed. Under a Causal lens the piece fails; under Accumulative it never teaches a pattern; the effect reads as outline.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page: the prophet performs her ritual, the storm diverts, she rests—a closed loop without a before/after legible with cost. The piece reads as a single illustrative cycle rather than a narrative with escalation and closure. Under an Accumulative lens the pattern would need to deepen or break; under Causal the storm's diversion would need to exact a price or alter options; neither happens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early and follows a causal chain: whistle → crack → chamber → revelation → acceptance. However, the closure hinges on exposition dump (father's journal) rather than on-page pressure, and the final "nodding" exchange with watchers reads as symbolic gesture without felt cost—Kael's options don't visibly narrow. The drive lens reads Causal, but the pivot depends on told backstory rather than a motivated choice that transforms present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is present early (who, where, when). The piece establishes a causal thread—letter guides Eleanor to station, station yields ledger—but the closure is a triumphant collection rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Eleanor's final stance is identical to her opening mission; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The ending summarizes theme ("truth would flourish") instead of landing a felt or conceptual cost in the final image, weakening closure validity under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is serviceable (who/where/when anchor by paragraph two), and the drive lens reads accumulative-textural. However, closure lacks decisive cost: the surveyor retrieves a box, reads memories, adds his own note, and departs—a sequence that deepens mood but does not reconfigure options or meaning with undeniable pressure. The final image ("hushed blaze of countless dreams") restates the premise rather than repricing it. No visible forfeiture or Charged Poise crystallizes; the ending feels like a pause in an ongoing routine rather than a closure unit with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words; Chinese character "通常" appears mid-sentence, breaking immersion). The piece accumulates discoveries but lacks a decisive on-page change: Elias ends "understanding" his heritage with no visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The blackout functions as backdrop rather than constraint—power returns without consequence. Cost is asserted ("weighed differently") but not dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough (workshop, floating isle, post-shadow timeframe). However, no on-page closure with cost is evident—the lantern maker executes a pre-planned ritual without reversal, and the "detachment" and "peace" are asserted rather than shown through a decisive change or reconfigured stance. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight prior material; it simply fulfills an announced goal. Cost is claimed ("tears of relief and sorrow") but not dramatized in a choice or forfeiture that alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (floating observatory, ruined city below). The hunt sequence progresses linearly: descent → location → absorption → return, but the escalation is more summary than causal pressure—"the crystal began to absorb" and "Elias felt a shift" tell rather than show the decisive change. The ending offers continuation ("ready for the next hunt") rather than a closure unit with visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. The lens reads Causal by intent but lacks because/therefore tightening at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes who/where/when within acceptable bounds and offers a single tightening when the Nightingale reaches convergence and Maya activates the pull sequence. However, the closure—"she had been both the seeker and the missing piece all along"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through prior causality; nothing Maya renounces or pays on the page makes this realization legible as a decisive change. The pilgrim's cryptic warnings and the observatory's response feel convenient rather than earned, and the "missing pieces" of the chip become "irrelevant" without visible cost. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the because/therefore setup of drone trajectory and cosmic alignment), the ending substitutes metaphysical declaration for on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Martin placing watch hand and carving together, then resolving to close his business—qualifies as Decisive Change, but the cost is primarily told in future tense ("Tomorrow, he would close") rather than felt in the present moment. The causality is clean but the final beat summarizes transformation instead of dramatizing the foreclosed path, weakening the on-page cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present early (who, where, when), but the plot operates by declaration rather than causal linkage: Lyra "needed to untether" and "synchronize through moon phases" without dramatized mechanics or escalation that narrows options. The closure—Rennett's apology and Lyra's forgiveness—lands on the page but lacks visible cost; nothing is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no relational or emotional price shown. The inferred lens wobbles between Causal (the exchange negotiation) and Accumulative/Textural (moon-phase imagery and mantra repetition), but neither deepens with pressure, and the ending resolves by fiat rather than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Earned Stasis transitioning to renewed purpose). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure unit—Elena accepting utility poles as valid guides and releasing her burden—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract rather than felt; we see dolphins and a declaration of self-forgiveness without a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that the choice forecloses. The lens holds, but cost legibility is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a time-loop closure but delivers it through exposition: the younger self explains "I was the clean slate seeker, but you're the time traveler" rather than letting causality build pressure. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word threshold; the bioluminescent lake and underground setting materialize without clear spatial anchoring. The loop structure (signing the ball, finding it again tomorrow) is told rather than earned through prior causal links that narrow options. Cost at closure is asserted ("completing the circle") but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: spice ritual builds density toward brother's manifestation, then fades at dawn. Orientation anchors adequately (beast whisperer, fairy-tale orchard, after phoenix rises). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Eliora accepts mortality yet retains the bond's understanding. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—"transformed yet fundamentally unchanged" directly contradicts the prior metamorphosis without showing what she actually lost or retained. The brother's appearance and advice arrive without friction or reversal, flattening the peak beat into a comfort sequence rather than a tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.9)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—mixes accumulative/textural (pattern of time imagery) with causal intention (quest structure) but delivers closure via thematic summary rather than a decisive on-page change or charged reconfiguration. The "repentance" and discovery that "lost time accumulates... in the present moment" are told insights, not dramatized reversals that narrow options or impose felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early, but the narrative unfolds as a series of summarized revelations rather than because/therefore linkage or cadence shift that reweights stakes. The ending offers wisdom without visible forfeiture or a final image that reconfigures prior material under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and shimmer patterns build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive by line 3 (Eli, spaceship, post-humanity). The closure—Eli crosses the threshold and the ship dissolves—registers as a moment of crystallized poise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no line shows what is forfeited or what pain accompanies the joy. The stitching sequence lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; each step proceeds as planned without friction or adaptation, flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens but never achieves the required density increase or cadence shift to earn closure. The "detour" inciting incident unfolds without prior constraint—Ian simply follows an impulse with no established cost or friction. The ending delivers several assertion-heavy epiphanies ("transformation wasn't something to be studied but experienced") rather than a single image that reweights prior material. The prophecy mechanism appears convenient, resolving a problem it did not create on the page, and no visible price is paid for releasing the bugs or meeting the girl.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece orients place and role by ~120 words but lacks meaningful escalation or a legible closure unit with felt cost. The blackout is resolved off-page ("power surged"), and Elias simply resumes his post—no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization forecloses a path. The "embers of revolution began to glow" is assertion without dramatized consequence. Under a Situational lens (the most charitable reading), pressure never crystallizes into a stance with on-page cost; under Causal, the sundial completion and power restoration feel coincidental rather than because/therefore linked to Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual intensifies toward pattern revelation), but the closure—star dust integrating with consciousness and visions becoming guidance—occurs off-stage as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost. The "lingering promise" is fulfilled by declaration in the final paragraph rather than through a visible choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the first paragraph, waiving that penalty, but the because/therefore linkage remains weak: placing stones triggers mystical effects without dramatized resistance or visible trade-off at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. The ending offers atmospheric assertion ("words would somehow seep through") rather than a decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or image that reweights prior material. No meaningful before/after emerges; the poet begins at the observatory with revolutionary intent and ends there with the same intent, now decorated by metaphor. The Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density increase nor situational crystallization coheres at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (glass atrium, sundial, waiting for symposium) within the first third. Drive lens reads as Causal initially (decoding the sundial coordinates) but dissolves into an explanatory encounter with the student that summarizes philosophy rather than escalating pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the student's "perfect comprehension" and Aris's final motto, but the cost is absent—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The coordinates revelation mid-story functions as a micro turn but does not tighten stakes or alter tactics in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, rusted library, moon clearing skyline) arrive early. However, the piece offers no causal escalation: the poet moves through tasks (pulling tin, scattering seeds, stacking books) in a static catalogue without a tightening choice or reversal. The ending ("continued his holy work") is a thesis statement, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern break nor situational crystallization is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after extended metaphorical setup ("nested within the boughs of the great tidal arbor"), triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—stepping into projected light to find "refuge in a space between moments"—lands off-page in a liminal space, then promises a future return; no decisive change or felt cost appears on the page. The causal chain from "clock ticks backwards" to "hidden sections in film" to "step into light" reads as convenient rather than motivated. The inferred lens (Causal) is undermined by the protagonist's frictionless execution and the lack of visible agency at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the seed's glow intensifies, stone circles resonate, collective memory stirs—density increases toward the closure. However, the closure itself (ancestral voices filling her consciousness, emergence with "luminous doubt") remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice or visible renunciation marks a before/after with felt cost. The final image smiles at how "empirical and whimsical had once again preserved what mattered most," telling rather than showing cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the compass's behavior, lace pattern revelation, and bonsai arrangement build toward the final glow and whispered name. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the compass settles, pointing inward; the tutor acknowledges the severance is "not ended" but the current has "found its true direction"), yet the cost remains oblique—no specific on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final beat. The confession "I never told her..." introduces a second unresolved thread (her eyes/waves) that diffuses focus without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive change (renewal in the fields) and cost (destroyed seeds), under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is clear early, and the demolition deadline creates coherent pressure. The arrow and piano bench decoding form because/therefore linkages that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with cost as Kael's realization reconfigures his quest, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The persistent constraint of his mortality and setting shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks, but the lens reliance on pattern over causal turns prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Maya facing hunters, reconfiguring her identity through vulnerability; cost is legible in "smiled through her heart-pounding fear." Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from betrayal to decryption to confrontation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (phobias) shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—the endless night as canvas—with felt cost in her smile and the glowing booklet. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the star's vanishing and the map's completion, creating a before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: integration of consciousness fragments alters Unit 347's directives to internal harmonies. Causal lens holds tightly from curiosity overriding protocol to temporal experiment and transformation. Orientation is anchored early ("frozen courtyard," "twilight"), and persistent constraint (composed nature) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara transitions from keeper of silence to facilitator of communication, under a causal lens with logical progression. Cost is legible in her renunciation of power, though it feels more positive than deeply felt. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Earned Stasis—Elias's satisfaction and the garden's response reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the marbles' recurrence charges the ending. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in lens persistence, but closure lands solidly with cost legible in the final whisper and rustle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: we move from wreckage and loss to revaluation of decay and small life, culminating in her new calling. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing, crystallized in the butterfly emergence and her conscious redirection of vocation. Causality is soft but coherent; the flood → greenhouse damage → observation of dust → perspective change sequence holds. The main limitation is that cost and turning points are mostly summarized rather than embodied in distinct scene beats, reducing structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation and causal flow are clear: the attack leads to the canyon retreat, the frost method, and the realization about smuggling, ending in a decision to act. The drive lens is primarily causal, with the frost patterns triggering a new understanding and next steps. However, much of the key activity (the fire, smuggling network, industrialist) is summarized rather than dramatized, so the decisive change feels slightly schematic. The cost of her choice going forward is only lightly implied rather than concretely pressured within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elena enters the conservatory, experiments, then leaves changed, and that throughline is clean. Causality within the scene is straightforward—she strikes the fork, observes, maps patterns, reaches an insight—but the pressure on each step is minimal, so turns feel more like restatements than developments. Closure does land (she has created a new musical language and reweighted her life), but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized. Structurally it’s coherent but feels outline-smooth rather than fully dramatized at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious package → coordinates → dive → library → restoration → new role, with no major orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid—Elias abandons his old life to become keeper of the revitalized library, reconfiguring the premise. However, the structural path is very smooth; the warned “dangerous currents and ghosts” never materialize as obstacles, so escalation feels outlined rather than pressured. The cost of the final choice is implied (leaving his life) but barely dramatized, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clear causal chain: years of sanctions → ongoing midnight distributions → news of harsher sanctions in the north → Elias’s decision to expand the operation. Structure is linear and clean with no orientation issues, and the closure beat—a public declaration that changes the scale and risk of their work—lands on the page. The cost is implied rather than dramatized in the final scene (we’re told the northern settlement “will need more support” but don’t see any concrete sacrifice or new obstacle yet), which blunts impact. Escalation is present but relatively gentle, more reflective than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one central mystical scene at the viaduct, then a later shard showing the consequences, with an accumulative/textural drive toward conceptual insight. Causality is simple but coherent (past life memory → quest to viaduct → breathing experiment → revelation → new vocation), and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “unused love.” However, turns arrive with minimal resistance or complication, so pressure never tightens in a way that makes options feel constrained. The time jump to “weeks later” is legible and functional but mostly explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: first encounter with the fragment and temporal dislocation, a return-to-normal aftermath, then a second, escalated engagement that culminates in merging with the garden. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the story lands a real closure beat with Elara’s disintegration/merger. However, some key turns are summarized rather than dramatized (e.g., “hours had passed, yet she felt as if she had lived a thousand lifetimes”), which slightly flattens impact. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal with accumulative imagery), and it holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation, causal flow, and closure are all clear: discover arrow → decode bench → open vault → escape → later success. The drive lens is straightforwardly causal, and the ending gives a legible before/after with seeds saved and spread. However, several turns (the arrow conveniently serving multiple purposes, the crew arriving just after she secures seeds) feel frictionless, softening the sense of cost. The weeks-later summary of her impact is effective conceptually but structurally easy, resolving stakes off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Kael’s obsession → experimental method in the greenhouse → apparent capture of betrayal → imprinting → realization that he’s also recorded healing. The piece reads as largely accumulative/lyric, but the closure beat qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing with a legible before/after stance on betrayal and trust. Much of the process (e.g., the decisive capture moment) is summarized rather than scened, which mutes the sense of turns. Still, the structure is coherent, oriented, and the ending cadence clearly reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: months of theft → targeted heist at the station → use of the jar to unlock the portraits’ secrets → redefinition of her role. Structure—station scene followed by workshop revelation—is tidy and comprehensible, with no orientation issues. However, the heist itself unfolds almost without resistance, undercutting the promised “complete the collection or fail forever” weight, and the cost of failure never feels materially present. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing, but with low on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one continuous session of work in the control room with melting ice as a temporal and emotional throughline. The global drive is textural rather than causal, and the closure—a softened voice and simple “we thaw”—is a clear resonant reconfiguration of the opening stance. Causality is modest but coherent: abandoned studio → refuge here → building terrariums → emotional thaw. Stakes stay small and internal, yet the before/after is legible and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine—hiding in the library, decrypting the cast to find her mother, deciding to face The Production—is legible and holds together. The piece lands a valid Charged Poise closure as the doors open and she chooses a stance rooted in truth and vulnerability rather than stunts. However, large stakes (shadowy organization, billionaire father, assassination threat) remain mostly offstage and summarized, so the decisive change lives more in declared internal resolve than in a concrete turn in options. Structure is clean but feels outline-like at times due to exposition density.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: star dimming → consultation of pebbles → decision to map darkness → star’s extinction and glowing booklet, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the “end.” Causality is soft but legible: her interpretive work and acceptance of the night reconfigure the crisis from prevention to navigation. Closure functions as a clear conceptual turn—night as canvas—with a felt, if mostly abstract, price. The story keeps its frame (single tower-night) and drive lens consistent, but the world’s external stakes remain largely offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain from discovery of the violin through contact, vision, musical experiment, and integration. Closure is decisive and legible—external directives fall away and the protagonist’s stance toward its work is reconfigured. The drive lens is primarily causal with an accumulative textural overlay, and that lens holds consistently. A slight excess of explanatory backstory about the second chance program slows momentum but does not disrupt structure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: she patrols, finds the lens, learns its power, discovers the hidden chamber, then makes a decision about using that power. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in how she intends to communicate. Closure is present but the decisive change—choosing to leave the lens and instead use doodle-notes—lands with modest, mostly conceptual cost. Escalation remains gentle, more discovery than genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: daily ritual → special bloom → commemorative marble → anticipation of the Institute visit → quiet recommitment at day’s end. Causality is simple but clean, and the closure (placing the nearly whole marble at the maze entrance before the scientists arrive) reads as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment that crystallizes his stance. The visit itself is deferred, so the main pressure never fully materializes in scene, which keeps the structural turn relatively gentle. Still, before/after is legible: by the end he has consciously framed the next day’s scrutiny as another round in the “conversation” with the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: three levers, three phases of the experiment, leading to a conceptual confirmation and personal resolution. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing—she understands time and the bird differently, and sees a new life-purpose—but no beat seriously threatens failure or forces her to adapt. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the outset and never wavers. The lack of complication or consequence keeps the arc from feeling fully dramatic despite its coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: discover the program → decode its music → play it to free/complete Madame Bellini’s aria, culminating in a reconfigured hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn; the before/after is legible but emotionally gentle. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, but the outcome feels almost inevitable once he decides to play—nothing on the page seriously complicates or threatens that plan. The cost of success remains conceptual and understated, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: fever and collapse → obsession with a swallowed truth → attention to margins → smudging → coordinates → decision to trek to the cave. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the metaphysical rules are introduced coherently enough to support the later revelations. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he steps out toward the cave, with the cost lodged in his body and the burden of returning the fragment. The main limitation is that most stakes stay conceptual rather than being concretely tested in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow—one night’s exploration with a clear start (entering the tunnel), central beat (radio confession/vision), and exit (dawn and reflection). The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural: atmosphere and motifs build to a conceptual repricing about confession and buried truths. Causality is thin but present (he turns on the radio, hears the confession, grips the wheel, has the vision), yet the coincidence of the perfectly relevant call reduces pressure. Closure exists but the change is conceptual and low-cost, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: anomaly sensed → origami swan used → entry into the pocket of regenerative silence → encounter with the manuscript/temptation → return and recommitment. Causality holds and the closure functions as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, with the keeper choosing to continue witnessing change rather than yielding to stasis. The cost is present but understated—continuing to endure decay and frayed self instead of accepting healing stasis. The accumulative, lyric drive lens is consistent, but a sharper on-page moment of pressured choice would raise the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: Maya’s backstory → her philosophy → plan to use the eclipse → musical ritual on the ridge → Lila speaks. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and maintained, with a clear build from room to ridge to eclipse climax. Closure is a decisive change—Lila’s first words—carrying emotional cost and relief for both characters. The structure is straightforward rather than intricate, but fully coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: vibration → tapestry → diaries → cosmology of dragons and axis → reaffirmed vocation. Causality is soft but legible, with each discovery explaining the world’s condition rather than forcing new tactical choices. Closure lands as a quiet conceptual repricing: the historian’s work is recontextualized as cosmically significant and potentially preparatory for dreams’ return, but the cost of this stance is only lightly implied. The lack of a sharper pivot or consequence keeps this from higher-tier structural strength.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative concept portrait rather than a plotted story, with the “action” being him typing fortunes and sending them out as he always does. There is no meaningful structural turn: the early premise (prophetic fortune writer using microdots to shape consciousness) is the same as the ending stance. Closure is a mild restatement—dawn comes, he smiles, the work continues—without a new constraint, loss, or reconfigured option. It reads more like a prologue or world sketch than a fully resolved narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: discovery of the anchor → developed method → application of loops and paint → rhetorical trap → silence as final move → exorcism succeeds. Orientation is clear from the outset (church, priest, possessed girl, ritual in progress), and the single-scene structure is easy to track. Closure lands with a decisive change (Sarah freed, anchor dormant again) and a modest conceptual repricing around silence, but the cost is conceptual rather than deeply felt. The drive lens reads primarily causal with some accumulative lyricism, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single morning’s attempt builds from preparation through intensifying memory-mapping to a crescendo and collapse. Causality is straightforward—focus deepens, the shell responds, vibrations mount, exhaustion claims him—and the closure image (time folding, a charged stillness) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds throughout. Stakes stay small-scale and internal, but they don’t drift or fuzz.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: tablet discovery → viaduct activation → eclipse window → descent into fractured timelines → convergence chamber → return with insight. The single transition into the altered viaduct is legible, and the story lands a clear closure unit in his realization and return. That said, the path through the fracture feels more like a guided tour than a pressured progression of choices, and the “labyrinth” is largely metaphorical rather than structurally dramatized. A touch more concrete jeopardy or constraint in the middle would strengthen the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal spine is clean: accident → numbness → cavern → discovery of needle/records → experiments → teaching others. The piece leans heavily on summary rather than dramatized turns, so beats like the first successful backward playback or the students’ visit land more as report than scene. Closure is present—Eleanor’s life reconfigured around a new form of music—but the cost of that journey is underplayed on the page. The accumulative structure is coherent, yet lacks a single, sharply dramatized pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: being followed → discovering the tube → reading the message → connecting it to his data → deciding to send his own message. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise when he releases the pigeon with incriminating data. However, major stakes (mass manipulation, governance structure) arrive mostly via exposition rather than dramatized turns, which flattens what should be peak beats. The piece holds a coherent Causal/Situational lens but opts for summary over scene at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure—successive scent revelations leading to an internal reconfiguration—holds cleanly, with clear orientation in time, place, and motive from early on. Causality is simple but intact: Elias sets up the ultraviolet lantern because of his question about grief, which triggers the cascading memories that culminate in a conceptual shift. The ghost orchid’s timed transformation parallels his internal turn, though it functions more as a symbolic echo than an active structural lever. Closure is solidly on the page as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he reopens his shop and reframes grief, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a single accumulative scene: arrive in grotto → elaborate rope pattern → conceptual realization about time as landscape, which delivers a valid conceptual repricing closure. Causality is mostly internal and reflective (“as the pattern grew more complex, new connections…”), but the progression is legible and the before/after is clear. The dominant stake—understanding how time has changed—remains abstract, with little on-page price for success or failure, which softens the ending’s impact. Orientation is strong from the start; no structural confusion, just limited narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: daily routine, family storytelling, experiments with the bowl and wrecks, culminating in the performance that redefines the hush. Causality is soft but coherent; habits and discoveries naturally lead to the climactic performance and insight, with no orientation issues. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the hush is reframed as latent music, and Kael’s purpose as echo-harbor violinist crystallizes. The limitation is that the decisive change has minimal on-page cost and the stakes remain mostly conceptual, which keeps the piece from feeling structurally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece tracks a clean, single-scene process: preparation → transformation → reflection, with no orientation issues. The drive lens feels largely accumulative/textural with light causality, and closure arrives as a conceptual repricing (he finds genuine fulfillment in counterfeit work). However, the transformation proceeds without complication or meaningful pivot; there is no moment where options narrow or consequences reframe tactics. As a result, closure is present but low-cost and somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: mistaken envelope → meeting → coffee → digitization project → ongoing cycle of connections; the pattern is easy to follow and the closure image of the locket clearly reconfigures the opening. Structurally, the story opts for a summarized, time-jumping arc rather than dramatized scenes, which flattens pivotal beats (digitization, sponsorship negotiations, Eleanor’s advisory role) into exposition. Closure is present but low-cost: nothing truly hangs in the balance as events unfold smoothly toward the thesis. The accumulative lens is consistent but underpowered in terms of felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: loneliness → proposal of a quest → group search → discovery and reinterpretation of the sigil → dedication of the arbor, with no major logic gaps. The story compresses the central search into summary (“Days dissolved into nights...”), which keeps structure coherent but softens the felt pressure of risk and effort. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the sigil’s meaning flips from elusive artist tag to ancestral emblem of unity, reweighting all prior longing. The cost—Elara’s long solitude and the danger of the crater—is more implied than sharply staged in the climactic beats, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: interrupted cadence → investigation using time powers → following the crystalline map → reaching the chamber → shattering the cage at personal cost. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the “nap clock” of the giant provides a clear temporal boundary that tightens toward the end. Closure lands solidly with a decisive change (cage destroyed, rhythm restored, lifespan spent) and the cost is plainly on the page. The main limitation is that the journey feels summarized in places (e.g., rooftop leaping and map-following are compressed rather than dramatized), which slightly flattens the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene ritual structure with a clear before/after: a routine experiment tips into a new pattern and a fleeting vision of the mentor, which reconfigures Elara’s sense of possibility. Causality is straightforward (ritual → eyes activate → patterns shift → new understanding), and the accumulative drive lens holds. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reconceives the “mathematics of emotion” and her loss. The main limitation is that cost remains mostly implied; there’s little concrete narrowing of options or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and coherent: outage → exploration in the pipe chases → discovery of the tape fragment → decision to seed it into the world. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a light causal spine, and the closure—a crystallized plan to help while staying hidden—lands as a quiet but legible Charged Poise. Causality holds, with no major set-ups dropped, though the sense of any true narrowing of options is mild. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, so there’s no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous leaf → failed attempts at control → pattern in data → deliberate experiment of removing protections → observed cost and payoff → revised methods. The structure uses a compressed, montage-like progression of storms and weeks that still maintains orientation and a coherent drive lens. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change with cost (some destruction, relinquished certainty) and a new stance articulated in the final advice she gives others. The main limitation is that the pivotal night of her experiment is skimmed in a single sentence instead of being more fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: insomnia and obsession → rain trails to lighthouse → brooch discovery → exchange → rare pigments → clarified purpose and eased insomnia. Structure is linear and legible with a clear before/after in her relationship to sleep and art, giving a solid Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Stakes are mostly internal and thematic, but the story never loses its line of action or drifts into formless reflection. The cost of the exchange could be sharpened, yet the closure still reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: pilgrim arrival → pearl study → strange shadow phenomena → realization and stance shift. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with the overlapping shadows and crystal music steadily intensifying toward the conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure is present—Elara moves from seer of futures to co-creator—with a clear before/after in her understanding. The main limitation is that the cost of this shift stays mostly conceptual and low-stakes, never forcing a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: object → vision → expanded context → revaluation of the herald → communal reframing, with a clear before/after in how exile is understood. Causality is largely conceptual rather than scene-based but coherent: the valve leads to vision, the diary confirms and deepens it, and this knowledge changes the community’s stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“ivory harbor” redefined from emptiness to presence—yet the cost is soft and mostly implied, with little on-page struggle to integrate the new truth. The heavy reliance on summary over scene flattens what could be sharper decisive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: find object → enter impossible vault → interface with fortress → return changed, which gives a coherent causal spine. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his life’s work is redefined as mapping human secrets with the punch as tool. However, escalation is smooth rather than tight—the scene lacks a concrete pinch point where his options narrow or a path is visibly foreclosed, and much of the “mission” is deferred to future evenings in summary. The hour constraint is gestured at but never forces a hard decision, softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story reads as accumulative/textural: the repeated evenings of transcription and whale migration build toward Elara’s decision to open the tower and accept her role. Causality is coherent—tile discovery → experimentation → visions → decision to invite others—but the beats are often told in summary instead of dramatized scenes, which flattens the sense of on-page turning points. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (she redefines the tower as a sanctuary and herself as keeper), but the cost and before/after shift are articulated more conceptually than felt. The structure is clear and linear, but the lack of a sharply rendered decisive moment keeps it below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is legible: solar storm disrupts his pocket, reveals the amulet’s deeper function, exposes the spatial mutiny, and drives him to step through the portal. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with a clear before/after at the moment he leaves the prismatic escondite. Closure lands as a combined decisive change and conceptual repricing (embracing immortality as opportunity), but the path is heavily summarized—major turns (learning Elara’s role, grasping the mutiny’s stakes) occur in exposition rather than dramatized beats. Costs and constraints at the end remain mostly conceptual, muting the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: observation → designed breach window → office/safe entry → forged asylum papers → emotional repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the opening; we know who, where, when, and what she intends. Closure lands as a decisive change—Maya has crossed a legal/ethical line using her father’s methods for a different moral purpose—but the cost is mostly conceptual, with no complication or near-failure to sharpen it. The plan works too smoothly to generate maximal structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: night → approaching dawn → ritual with the lamp → return to quiet work. Under a textural lens, the build to the moment of the hum “refracting” functions as the primary tightening. Closure is a gentle Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he continues his task in a dead world, which conceptually reweights his solitude. Still, stakes never shift or narrow in a way that makes a strong before/after boundary; it’s a well-executed vignette rather than a full structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece works as an accumulative/textural mosaic, with the daily tide-driven pilgrimages and repeated motifs (containers, label, stories) cohering into a Conceptual Repricing closure about identity beyond bureaucracy. Causality is minimal but consistent, and the pattern is taught early and held. Closure is clear: the question “Who was I before the death certificate?” is explicitly repriced as irrelevant by the end. What’s missing is a sharper structural tightening or on-page turn; the pressure and pattern barely shift, they just accrue.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: enter observatory → discover objects → use cello to access memories → synthesize astronomers’ debate → conceptual realization about the riddle. Causality is intact and legible, and the ending offers a clear Conceptual Repricing where her understanding of “truth” changes. That said, the drive lens is mostly causal-discovery with modest pressure; the turns feel orderly rather than urgent or fraught. The cost of her new stance is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the closure solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal line is coherent: discovery of the code → systematic mapping → encoded counterproposals → favorable terms, with a clear before/after in Neptunia’s fate. The story opts for an accumulative, summary-driven structure rather than discrete scenes, which flattens some potential turning points (e.g., council negotiations occur entirely off-page). Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s allegiance resolves and the city’s tactic against privatization crystallizes. Cost is present but soft—partial victory and anonymous influence rather than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: she arrives, sets the chemical timer, waits, photographs, witnesses extinction, and leaves with a reweighted sense of purpose. Closure is present as an Earned Stasis/quiet DC: she has completed the mission at the cost of witnessing loss. However, almost nothing meaningfully complicates or redirects the plan; there is little sense that failure is possible once the setup is in place. Structural solidity is there, but the arc feels predictable and under-pressured for its premise.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged drone arrives, Elias diagnoses and repairs it before the ship departs, and confirmation of success provides closure. The piece achieves a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image reweights his work as maintaining human connection rather than just fixing objects. However, costs and alternatives never feel sharply delimited; there’s little genuine doubt the repair will succeed in time. There’s also a conceptual wobble around how a blind man “watches” light refraction, which slightly undermines world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: obsession → outpost waiting → coordinates via falcon → journey → discovery → report and reframed understanding. Structure is linear with a brief, handled transition from outpost to journey to convergence and back, and orientation is solid throughout. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing, with the final condensation pattern and reflection on why humans seek origins; this lands clearly. The main structural weakness is how frictionless the middle is—three days of travel and the sacred discovery are summarized with minimal complication, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is clean: arrive, diagnose discord, walk and tune, then seal the restoration at the archway. Causality is coherent—every step and strike feeds the town’s repair—and the closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration as Silverwood shifts from decaying to humming. However, stakes remain abstractly “imminent” without a concrete on-page test or narrowing of options, so the final success feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The linear pressure never tightens beyond steady progress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: decipher hieroglyphs → locate depression → use vial as key → enter chamber → fill vial → escape as oxygen dwindles. Orientation (who/where/when, stakes of oxygen) is crisp early, and the story holds a clear Causal drive lens through to the closing rescue image. Closure lands with a Decisive Change: Elena secures the temporal energy and survives, reconfiguring her options and the world’s knowledge. However, tension softens when the rescue sub appears conveniently and no major setback complicates the central quest.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is accumulative and pattern-based, but the beats circle the same motifs without a strong sense of development. The closure—“finally found his voice… to whisper the truth”—is a resonant reconfiguration, yet it is not anchored in a distinct causal moment where his options or circumstances change. The “bodies” clock and any external consequences are left vague, so the implied urgency never functionally tightens. Overall, it reads as a mood-piece with light arc rather than a fully sharpened story.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: failed experiment → ghostly binding → bead activation → strengthened presence → seed release → bloom as reincarnation marker. The piece balances past and present without losing orientation, and the closure (bead crumbling, debt repaid, new bloom) gives a clear before/after with cost. Structure is essentially linear with one reflective block, fitting an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. The only limitation is that much of the crucial conflict is backstory, leaving the present-tense sequence slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and intelligible: plate discovery → dream pull → canyon sewing → orchids/labyrinth transformation → communal pilgrimage and purpose. Causality is present but light, with many major developments (e.g., villagers turning the route into pilgrimage, visitors from distant lands) summarized rather than dramatized. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s purpose and the canyon’s role in the village are clearly “after” compared to the opening. The cost of that closure (what she risks or permanently forgoes) remains abstract, which keeps the arc from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: return → discovery of the sundial → deepening involvement → completion and inner shift, with a clear before/after at the final alignment of light. Causality is straightforward and legible, with no major orientation issues and a coherent temporal flow through the excavation. However, most beats are summary-like progressions of the same motion (he helps, he fits pieces, he reconnects) rather than discrete turns that constrain options or generate new pressures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change under duress, which keeps it strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: dawn ritual → chalk coding → reflection on work → mailing the letter, with a conceptual reweighting at the end. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure image (dropping the letter) clearly marks a before/after in her understanding of her role. However, the live clock (noon maglev) never quite tightens the sequence into genuine pressure. The piece reads as a beautifully framed moment rather than a scene that must go differently because of any specific turn.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is coherent: galaxy anomaly → recognition of engineered pattern → synchronized decoding with earthly events → embroidered sabotage plan → off-page unraveling of the coup. The piece lands a valid closure via conceptual repricing: power shifts from overt heroism to invisible, pattern-level resistance. However, key turns (discovering the exact plot, implementing delays, the coup’s failure) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact and cost. The drive lens reads clearly causal throughout, but the resolution feels somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: she enters with a goal, attempts the ritual, receives incomplete then deeper messages, and exits with a changed stance. Causality under an accumulative lens holds—each condensation message and shard response layers toward the final “I forgive.” Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the before/after (seeking apology vs. offering forgiveness) is legible with emotional cost implied. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal and resolution feels nearly guaranteed from the outset, reducing structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, single-scene lyric where pressure builds texturally rather than through strong causal turns, and that pattern is clear and consistent. Orientation is solid (who, where, when, why are quickly legible), and the closure—Kaelen’s whispered promise and the returned coral—offers a modest resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive change. Still, the narrative arc is fairly static; his stance at the end feels like a gentle reaffirmation of what was already stated (“His mission here was clear”) rather than a newly compelled shift with evident cost. This keeps the structure from hitting a truly elite level of impact.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the fragment → experimentation with light → decision to create a display → community response and renewed festival. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main throughline and a clear closure where the district’s festival is reborn. However, many turns are handled in summary (“The town council granted her permission…”) without friction, and no moment of real jeopardy complicates her plan. The closure lands conceptually but without a strong sense of cost or hard-earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative, with the nested “awakenings” giving a clear scaffolding of deepening perception and culminating in her returning the nickel and leaving changed, which functions as a Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is mostly tight (nickel → reflected sound → awakenings → new stance), but the progression feels almost too smooth, with minimal resistance or complicating beats to sharpen the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as largely accumulative/textural: a tour through methods of resistance that builds toward a conceptual closure rather than a concrete turn. Causality is coherent (Thought Tax → evolving surveillance → increasingly organic countermeasures → nationwide resistance signal), but most of this is told as compressed history rather than played as scene. Closure is present in the nationwide signal and Kaelen’s untaxed thought, yet the decisive change is conceptual, with little felt on-page cost or narrowed options. Structural flow is smooth, but it lacks a strong inciting moment and peak beat within the present-time frame.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: postcard arrival → lullabies → blossoms → armistice → legacy, with a clear before/after around the shell’s transformation. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure—poet’s death with lullabies integrated into the shell—is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with a visible price (their life spent sleepless). Causality is mostly intact, if somewhat impressionistic, and time jumps are legible. The main limitation is that pressure rarely sharpens into discrete turning points; events feel smoothed into a continuous mythic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: disturbance → discovery of the cracked tube → choice to repair via song-light → restoration → reinstallation → renewed names. The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive, and closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the work continues, but the cost of inevitable forgetting is foregrounded. Stakes and option-narrowing are modest but coherent; there are no serious causality breaks or disorienting shifts. The ending carries a tangible sense of partial, temporary victory against entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal throughline is clean: research under deadline → discovery of interconnected promises → realization of consequences → decision to confront the leaders. Closure lands as a charged poise moment when she walks toward the chamber, but the decisive change happens off-page, so the cost and impact remain mostly prospective. Structure is linear and coherent, yet almost all turns occur in her study rather than through active opposition or complication. The stakes are declared high (treaties, permanent division) but never materially challenge her tactics in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is coherent: the found envelope and adhesive test lead to the realization of a past ally, which primes her to discover the inscription and design a compromise solution, culminating in her decision to present it and leave her own encoded message. The piece reads as a single continuous scene with a clear before/after: from uncertainty about reconciling stakes to confident commitment to a specific plan. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost of that decision—political, personal, or practical—remains largely off-stage and abstract. The hybrid drive (causal plus atmospheric accumulation) is stable, yet escalation in constraints and repercussions is relatively mild.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure—from meteorite discovery to gradual experimentation to relaunching the courier service—tracks clearly and causally. Time shifts (“across the span of days that grew into weeks,” “seventh Thursday”) are handled cleanly, and the closure—releasing the first pigeon under the skylight—lands as a decisive change. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, but the before/after in her stance toward her past is legible. A slightly sharper hinge moment of doubt or risk before committing would deepen the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: wandering in a strange realm → finding a threshold that uniquely resonates → revelation and crossing → reunion. Causality broadly holds—her decoding of symbols and wood grain logically leads to the special doorway—under an accumulative/lyric lens. Closure lands via a decisive change (stepping through to “Home”) combined with a conceptual re-framing of sacred thresholds. The main soft spot is that obstacles are largely atmospheric; nothing meaningfully resists or complicates her progress once the crucial symbol appears.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: descent → discovery of feather → pull toward central dome → revelation with creatures → feather-map epilogue. Causality is soft but coherent (the feather draws her; her touch elicits the constellation; the feather later becomes a map). The closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her understanding of belonging and the facility’s purpose reprice the whole journey, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative, lyric structure: cave → seeds → planting → realization that disappearance equals metamorphosis. Causality is coherent—the bird’s seeds enable the vision, which resolves her core question—but the escalation is gentle and largely expository. Closure functions as a clear conceptual repricing rather than a hard turn, with her stance shifting from conjecture to certainty. The lack of a sharper cost or structural surprise limits its heft at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Leo observes, selects a subject, enacts his plan, and we see it land, all within one continuous scene. Closure exists as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—Leo succeeds again and recommits to his pattern with the stars “winking” as co-conspirators. Still, the structure is essentially a single smooth arc with no real complication or turn in the middle, so escalation and perceived cost are modest. Nothing strains plausibility or orientation, but the ending doesn’t reconfigure options so much as affirm the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one coherent scene building from dance to discovery to transformation, with a clear before/after in Lira’s state. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each paragraph layers mythology and intent until the anchoring and inscription reconfigure her exile. Causality is broadly sound (dance → moonstone activation → aperture/anchoring → inscription), though steps like the “previously unseen aperture” and spontaneous anchoring are accepted very quickly, without much dramatized uncertainty. Closure is present and legible, but the journey there feels slightly outlined rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: early-morning setup → inexplicable pull to the shore → ritual with the stone and pond → conceptual revaluation of her work, a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, with each image layering toward the final realization. The main weakness is that the “inexplicable force” and the prism atrium arrive as given wonders rather than emerging from prior pressure, so the crucial turn feels more bestowed than earned. Cost at closure is implied (a more burdened sense of purpose) but not sharply articulated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is simple but coherent: a single night walk on the ridge, interwoven with one key backstory shard (the fire and child) that directly reweights the present. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each pass over the box and stars deepens rather than repeats, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as he reinterprets the box’s meaning and his own scars. Causality is clean—he leaves the station to think, remembers the origin of the box, and arrives at a new stance with visible emotional cost. The drive and closure are modest in scope but fully legible and satisfying for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: preparation in the grotto → gauge activation → rapid escalation (spinning) → alignment and realization. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: his deliberate patterning leads to a qualitative change in how possibilities behave. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration when the gauge points at him and then outward, signaling that the experiment has altered reality’s option-space. The main weakness is that the stakes and costs of this change remain abstract, so the before/after line is intellectually legible but only mildly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain (exploration → side passage → diaries/film → development → realization/commitment) is clean and easy to follow, with a legible two-shard structure (ruin and lab). Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: what walls "dream" about is redefined and taken on as a responsibility. However, the decisive change is primarily intellectual and carries little on-page cost or narrowing of options. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, but escalation and payoff remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual sequence from pre-dawn through the bells to departure, with rain as the inciting condition and the bell-timed vision as climax. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—rain awakens the connection, song spreads through the terrace, bells mark the threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she achieves the vision she’s worked toward and then relinquishes it, returning to her cyclical pattern with a cost. The stakes remain relatively abstract and unthreatened, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous arc from pre-negotiation through signing to quiet aftermath, with clear temporal progression. Causality is intact (ritual negotiation → partial success → uneasy celebratory aftermath → reflective departure), and closure lands in the charged image of the clipboard left behind and peace reframed as ongoing practice. However, key plot turns (the “first breach,” the mapping of lands, the emergence of cracks) are mostly told in summary, so we don’t feel any singular decisive beat where options truly narrow. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative, and that’s held consistently, but escalation through concrete events is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous walk across the salt flat interwoven with backstory that directly informs the present choice. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds—his engineered drought creates the wasteland, which frames the act with the egg and the unplanned breaking of the drought by rain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: nothing material is fixed, but his stance toward what he’s done and what can be preserved is reweighted. The main limitation is that escalation is more tonal than event-driven, so the middle does not significantly narrow options beyond what the opening already implies.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, ritual-centered structure is coherent: courtyard → preparation → untangling threads → stepping into the sanctuary, with clear before/after. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and closure lands through a decisive change plus conceptual repricing when the sanctuary is revealed as a state of being and she becomes its keeper. Causality is simple but intact—dream method → study → ritual → unlocking—with no major orientation issues. The one weakness is that the price of success is more asserted than dramatized, so the climax carries less concrete strain than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: dome → bar performance → dome reflection, with a coherent accumulative drive about ethical storytelling. Causality is present but soft—he prepares, performs, reflects, and nothing meaningfully resists or deforms his plan. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: he recommits to his path with new stories added to the stick, but the cost of that stance is only lightly implied. The piece feels complete yet low-pressure rather than narratively urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: observation of the lone monarch → knotting ritual → deployment of the moth wing → the monarch’s apparent acknowledgment → quiet closure as Aris commits to leaving with this memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) rather than a decisive act, and the cost—accepting the likely erasure of migrations while insisting on marking them—is legible. Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens, with each move growing out of the last without disorienting jumps. The main limitation is that the central turn (the monarch responding to the wing-signal) feels more like a gentle beat than a deeply disruptive change in options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: pilgrimage → discovery of rope → application of card pattern → activation → decision to remain, all legible and well-sequenced. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as she chooses an enduring role as keeper of names, with a clear before/after. However, the process from attempt to success is almost frictionless—there is no serious risk of failure or misstep, so escalation feels modest. The piece reads as a well-shaped ritual rather than a pressured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—directive → bunker → seal → ritual → dream → new perception—is clean and easy to follow, with a legible before/after via her expanded perception. The piece achieves closure: she resolves the initial drive to understand “paths” with a new model of destiny and a concrete experiential shift. That said, the ritual’s success feels somewhat preordained and under-contested: there’s little sense of alternative outcomes or real risk in the attempt. Structure is solid but the arc could use one complication or setback to deepen earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Anu prepares, performs a ritual, unlocks the tile, and undergoes a change, with a clear before/after. Closure is present—he attains the covenant and gains glowing symbols—but the external pressure of Nebuchadnezzar’s approach never materially complicates the ritual or his options. The drive leans Hybrid (causal beats within an accumulative, atmospheric frame), and this holds consistently. The lack of a real setback or choice under duress keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Marcus arrives with resentment → Elara introduces the intact box and cellular memory → the vision sequence → repaired pin → appearance of the brother and reconciliation. The scene is continuous, oriented, and lands a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the brother’s sudden manifestation feels convenient, and the cost of change is underplayed, reducing the sense of hard-won closure. The drive lens reads as predominantly causal with a light spiritual gloss, and that lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece offers a clean single-scene causal chain: sextant acquired → repair ritual → transformation → encounter with dream → redefined purpose. Closure is solid (a reconfigured tool and mission), but the felt price of failure or success remains low and mostly conceptual. The accumulative, ritualistic pacing works, though a sharper complication in the middle would tighten the structure. Orientation is excellent, and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: return to cathedral → rediscovery of the bag → building the bridge → bloom → footprints/seed, all tracking clearly from Elara’s intention. Structure is linear and coherent, with a solid closure beat in the footprints and the planted seed (a resonant reconfiguration of her prospects with her daughter). The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyrical texture, and the ending’s cost (years of estrangement, uncertain outcome) is legible. Stakes remain small-scale and inward, but suitably so for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is clean: discovery → containment → bathroom realization → decision → research chamber activation → expanded comprehension → quiet aftermath. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each step logically following his engagement with the pistachio shell and its resonance. Closure is present as both a decisive shift (choosing to step beyond temporal limits) and a conceptual repricing of time and knowledge, though the cost remains mostly intellectual rather than dramatized. There are no orientation issues, but the escalation toward the climax is smooth rather than sharply contoured.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clean: time traveler → diary → renegotiation → entry → rescue → revaluation of “gaps.” Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure beat in her reframed understanding and vow. However, key transitions—especially the renegotiation and the extraction—are handled briskly and nearly frictionless, which softens the sense of earned turning points. The cost of success remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in a way that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: card arrival → ship exploration → ballroom memory threads → descent to garden → tree contact and redefinition of purpose. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent, with each step deepening her access to memories and culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of her role. Closure is present and legible in the emerald card dissolving and her acceptance as chronicler, with a conceptual cost in her “trapped freedom.” The piece remains mostly reflective rather than event-driven, but it stays internally consistent and anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery of the door → seal and notes → rope → braid reconfiguration → Croft’s reappearance. The piece offers proper closure via a decisive change (she successfully merges times and meets Croft) and conceptual reweighting (the “fables of absence” become literal warnings), but the cost dimension at the end is faint. Structure is basically one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored backstory shards; orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The main weakness is that the path from problem to solution is very straight, with no meaningful complications or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the energy beings disrupt, prompting the search in the Ice Sanctum, discovery of the pattern, then conjuring the bloom of hush, leading to reconfiguration with the beings and a coda of integration. Structure is essentially linear with one temporal glide into “days passed” and then “years later,” which is legible and supports an accumulative epilogue. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the caves move from disruption to a new, integrated harmony. The main weakness is the lack of visible resistance or real risk; nothing meaningfully complicates or almost derails the plan, so the structural arc feels smooth rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: retrocognitive research → revelation about the shard of hush → alignment of the prism → rekindled beacon → conceptual insight. Structure is linear and coherent with a clear closure unit (the beacon lighting and the revaluation of coincidence). However, obstacles are almost entirely offstage; the process “day after day” is summarized, and the climax unfolds without real resistance or risk of failure on the page. The result is satisfying but not structurally tense enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural progression: observatory → descent → forecourt listening → monument shadows → vow and writing. Orientation is clean and the structure is coherent, with a clear before/after in his internal articulation of purpose. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise: he claims his role as shaper of collective memory), but the lack of real obstacles or trade-offs keeps the causal pressure soft. The sequence is graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: approach → discovery of the mosaic note → ascent and performance → aftermath in the transformed fortress. Causality holds (ambient awareness → mosaic clue → specific composition → unique fireworks), and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration where the fortress’s mood and symbolic function change. However, the journey in is summarized rather than dramatized, and the central action faces no obstacles or reversals, so escalation feels mild. Cost at closure is more implied (effort, emotional weight) than concretely legible.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a difficult funding question → suspended conversation/pause → reflective realization → resumption with a new stance. As an accumulative/textural piece, causality arises from meditation on setting and heirloom rather than external events, and that throughline holds. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—Maya redefines transition and funding scarcity as the core of her research—but the cost is mostly implied, with no concrete loss or foreclosed path on the page. The drive lens stays coherent, but the stakes and price at closure feel somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: childhood setup → years of preparation → timed anomaly → ascent → trellis encounter → return with transformed perspective. Causality under a mostly accumulative/causal lens holds without notable gaps—the inversion enables the journey, her training enables perception, the vessel enables bringing the hush home. However, the journey unfolds almost frictionlessly; nothing meaningfully threatens failure, and the “hour” constraint never tightens into concrete pressure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, with only a lightly felt sense of risk/cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story forms a coherent single-scene arc: train whistle → vaulting hush → Elias’s intervention → passengers subtly changed → cyclic reset with another whistle. The accumulative/textural drive is clear and the closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, with the storm glass and clouds reframing peace as temporary. However, the causal chain lacks friction—nothing meaningfully threatens failure, and all setups pay off without complication. Structure is clean but low-pressure, which reduces the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clear: forbidden sally → waterfall gate → monolith murals → tree → elevator → throne, with a clean closure beat when she awakens the throne. The drive lens reads as Causal and holds, but most beats feel like smooth progression rather than pressured choice—each problem has an immediate, convenient solution (e.g., the earth “politely” dissolving, the ruby flake instantly providing overlays). Closure is present (mission complete, throne awakened) but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly sketched. Structurally functional and readable, but not yet tight or surprising enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: isolation → pulsing ring → remembered duty and stakes (fading threshold, trapped souls) → decision to knock and step through → encounter and offered help. The structure is linear and coherent, with backstory smoothly woven through present stimuli (ring, sanctuary) and paid off in the final beat. Closure lands as a decisive change—she abandons her ashen refuge—with on-page cost and clear before/after. The drive lens reads as hybrid with an accumulative texture but sufficient causality to keep options and stakes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: glitchy texts → decision to explore → descent to the terrace → discovery of the bolt → activation and payoff. Structure is cleanly one scene with embedded backstory, and the closure unit (she uses the bolt and redefines her role) is on the page. However, major beats unfold with little resistance or complication; dangerous instability and secrecy are told, not truly exploited for plot pressure, so the climax feels low-cost and somewhat frictionless. The “when concepts became physical” frame is intriguing but underused structurally, reading more like a rationale than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: he brings a modified gramophone, tunes it to the palace’s resonance, triggers a hidden compartment, and obtains proof to end the dynasty. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early, and the scene proceeds in a single, legible arc. Closure is decisive—he physically acquires the parchment and commits to its use—but the stakes remain mostly conceptual, with minimal on-page resistance or complication. The structure is solid and publishable but not yet intricately pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: discovery of the program → study and preparation → performance of the ritual → visionary overlap of realities → return with a new role, which gives a clear before/after. As an accumulative/textural design, the pressure builds through deepening engagement with the text rather than external obstacles, and the closure (a conceptual repricing of his withdrawal into a vocation) is legible and on-page. Causality is intact and smooth, though the stakes and cost of the ritual remain mostly abstract, with no concrete consequence that would truly bite. The structure feels complete and publishable but not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: button → dust analysis → Benjamin’s file → thematic reframing → eventual reunion, with a simple two-shard structure that stays coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Eleanor’s solitary archival work gains concrete human reciprocation in Benjamin’s visit. The months-later jump is efficient but softens immediacy, and the phone call summoning Benjamin borders on convenient rather than pressured. Stakes are modest but legible and appropriate to the length and design.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: warning → increased patrols → puddle map → lagoon vault → key/protocol → transfer and escape. The piece delivers a complete mission arc with a clear before/after (archives at risk vs. archives exfiltrated), satisfying basic closure. However, several turns lean on convenient devices (the sudden magical map, the TrueComm-key-only protocol change) that feel engineered rather than earned, softening structural rigor. Cost at the end is mostly implied future danger, not sharply dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal arc from approach → preparation → performance → resolution, with no orientation issues. The drive lens is primarily causal—he comes because of the prophecy and uses a specific musical method to counter it—and closure lands when the prophecy is hushed. Cost is present but modest, mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt. The piece avoids plot holes, but the prophecy’s external stakes remain abstract, which slightly softens the sense of before/after impact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure: annual hush → sorting → discovery of moonstone → transformation → decoding and recording the warning → placing the monument. Causal links are legible—the moonstone intensifies her powers and leads to clearer prophecy—but the escalation is gentle rather than pressured. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she ends with a new warning delivered and a slightly deepened attunement, readying for the next cycle. The cost of this cycle, however, remains conceptual and light, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: compass discovery → greenhouse → waterfall → natural clocks → changed practice. Causality is generally intact (the compass leads to the greenhouse, the waterfall forces improvisation, the chamber reweights his worldview). However, obstacles resolve very smoothly with little sense that options are meaningfully constrained or could fail. Closure via conceptual repricing is on the page but carries limited cost beyond a graceful shift in belief.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: failed search → acceptance of Lumina’s loss → conceptual pivot to kintsugi → forging the new coin → reconfiguration of purpose, with no orientation issues. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a reflective overlay, and closure lands via a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when he moves from failure to self-forged redemption. That said, the “search party” and centuries of wisdom are declared stakes that never face a concrete test on the page; the plot is almost entirely internal and procedural. The ending’s cost is implied rather than dramatized—his acceptance of Lumina’s loss is stated, not struggled with in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias tracks the child via the harp and tooth, locates the cave, elicits confession, uses laughter to catalyze release, and the tooth’s state and final vow frame closure. Orientation is solid and maintained; we always know where we are and what the immediate aim is. Closure lands as a decisive change (Thomas freed) plus a resonant reconfiguration (Elias’s method quietly vindicated, his burden incrementally deepened). The main limitation is that the middle lacks a complicating turn—once he reaches the cave, resolution unfolds smoothly without much structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: wake → orient in the forest → engage with mask strap → decode its meaning → reframe mercy. Causality is more conceptual than event-driven, but still coherent: forest stimuli trigger trauma responses, which lead him to examine the strap, which then unlocks the insight. Closure lands as conceptual repricing—he redefines mercy and his survival—but the lack of a sharper turn or on-page consequence keeps the ending relatively low-stakes. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, so there’s no structural confusion, just a quiet, idea-led arc.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly circular—childhood discovery to present unlocking—and causality is legible: fragment → study → decoding painting → opening the barrier. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a causal spike at the end, and the closure beat (histories “flood into the present”) is clear. However, most of the “plot” is summarized apprenticeship rather than dramatized struggle, so decisive turns feel inevitable rather than pressured. Cost at closure is almost entirely conceptual; nothing on the page meaningfully narrows her options or exacts a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal sequence: investigation → discovery of the mainspring barrel → timed silence at 4:17 → thinning of reality → decision to use the device to bridge worlds. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid and early, and the story builds toward a legible closure where Marcus reframes his gift and uses the device to change the status of the barrier. The closure is a conceptual reconfiguration more than a decisive external change, but it’s on-page and coherent under a mostly causal lens. Cost, however, remains lightly sketched—there’s no real sense of danger or loss accompanying the success, which keeps the structural impact somewhat modest.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is coherent: discovery of the whisper → preparation → destabilization → rupture → reconfiguration of the library and Eldon’s role. The drive reads as largely accumulative/textural, but cause-and-effect remains legible and closure lands with a clear before/after and tangible cost (sanctuary destroyed/transformed). Some turns feel inevitable rather than choice-driven (“on the seventh day… the rupture occurred”), reducing tension. Still, the story satisfies the closure requirement with a solid resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: storm approaches → Elias prepares and writes → the manuscript circulates and reframes the dispute. Causality holds at the conceptual level and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing (truth as constellation rather than artifact) with social cost implied. However, major turns—especially the reception of the manuscript—are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts immediacy. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, but the key external beat happens off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal line is clean: rust threatens music, Elias prepares ritual, amplifies through the chamber, repels the rust, and restores music citywide. The midnight deadline and the clock’s chimes provide a basic structural spine with a legible before/after. However, the “covenant of rust” originating in a broken promise is delivered as a sudden realization rather than dramatized or earned through prior beats. Resolution is swift and nearly frictionless, so while closure is clear, the pathway to it feels under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: factory closure → access to cliffs → compass visions → cave → lagoon → awakenings → conceptual reframing back home. The structure is linear, well-oriented, and lands a clear closure beat when she places the compass among the vials and re-understands her collecting. The “hinged awakenings” provide a scaffold of escalation, but they are somewhat labeled rather than organically felt turns, and the transformation is almost frictionless. Cost and constraint at the ending are subtle—more philosophical than situational—so the closure is resonant but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: GPS failure → discovery of the archway and slide → visions → sculpture → departure with a new internal compass. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “navigation” and “timewoven alliances,” but the cost of this change is underplayed; nothing significant is sacrificed. Structurally, it’s a single, continuous scene with a coherent before/after, if somewhat outline-like in transitions. The accumulative drive is consistent even if major beats resolve too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: postcards → long search → discovery of the window card → journey to the cathedral → nocturnal observation → conceptual realization → return with a new artistic mission. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing of her central question, with a before/after legible in how she’ll now paint. Cost is implied rather than dramatized—years of searching and a surrendered frame of understanding—so the ending is resonant but low in sharp consequence. Still, the piece feels structurally whole and immediately comprehensible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine (diaries → retrocognition → lagoon experiment → understanding → publication) is coherent and easy to follow, and the piece lands a clear closure beat with her decision to publish. Structure is more a compressed synopsis than a scene under pressure, with events often reported in past perfect rather than experienced. The time travel/temporal mechanics are gestured at but never complicated enough to create structural tension or constraint. Closure has conceptual weight but relatively light narrative cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: town changed by wishes → spiritual lack → Elior’s reflection on the bottle and alchemical tradition → conceived plan → posting notices and people arriving, which provides a clean closure beat. The piece leans heavily on summary and reflection rather than dramatized beats, so escalation feels more like an outline of ideas than lived pressure. Closure does land as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, but the felt cost is thin—rejecting “false comfort” is asserted, not really tested. Structure is linear and clear, but it reads closer to a manifesto vignette than a fully dramatized story.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clear: encounter with the wax shaving → immersion → accidental prophecy → redefinition of duty, with a clean before/after at the ending (archiving oaths vs. archiving a civilization’s emotions). The museum memory as portal is legible and returns conceptually at the end, and the piece achieves closure via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn. Still, much of the development feels inevitable rather than pressured; the prophecy arrives conveniently and his new mission is accepted almost without resistance, muting a sense of earned cost. Structurally sound and coherent, but not yet taut.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s structure is cleanly accumulative: seed arrangement → entropy decrease → vortex manifestation → conceptual realization, with causal links legible even in a lyric mode. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, and closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing when she understands herself as the texture of borrowed time. Stakes and cost are more metaphysical than situational, but her awareness that “her own days were numbered” gives the ending real weight. There are no orientation issues, though the explanation of entropy/time briefly edges toward expository summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present repair and setup, contextual backstory, solstice as deadline, then the bell’s autonomous ring as closure. Causality holds (his switch → bell reacts to storm onset), and the zero-hour frame gives a clear spine. However, escalation is mostly conceptual; the “most powerful storm in decades” never exerts direct, on-page pressure beyond eerie clouds. Closure is a quiet conceptual repricing rather than a decisive change with palpable cost, which is effective but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: routine → unusual sensation through the glass → decisive step into the void → reconfigured understanding and return. Causality is clean, and the closure (a conceptual repricing of falling stars and vulnerability) lands legibly. However, stakes and cost remain soft; abandoning the instruments and stepping out feels almost frictionless, with no real resistance or consequence dramatized. The piece relies on lyrical insight rather than structural tightening to carry its ending.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: discovery of ghosts → understanding of oasis history → discovery of box → learning the covenant → final ritual and opening. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens: each new layer of knowledge about the covenant narrows what the recluse can do until endurance and silence become the only viable tactic. Closure lands cleanly with a Conceptual Repricing: the single golden bee redefines the covenant as a charge to preserve unspoken weight, not to restore the past. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; we don’t see an alternative path meaningfully foreclosed on the page, which slightly blunts impact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal spine is coherent: study of the capsule → suspended moment → rediscovered messages → new understanding → decision to pass knowledge on. Structure is linear and easy to follow, but escalation is conceptual rather than situational, with stakes largely intellectual and metaphysical. The key turn—her becoming “suddenly timeless” and rediscovering messages—arrives more as a convenient anomaly than as the result of a build in pressure or choice. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing, but the cost and before/after divide could be made sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a single accumulative scene: observation → reflection → kite incident → renewed flow → departure, all coherent under a textural lens. Causality is light but intact; the snapped kite triggers a perceived inner release, which then colors her renewed writing and the closing act of bookmarking the feather. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with a clear before/after in her creative blockage. The main limitation is the relative flatness of turns—no major surprise or structural tightening beyond the kite moment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: diagnosis → discovery of diary → project to awaken the pillars → completion and death, with closure landing clearly as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The six-month structure provides temporal clarity, though much of it is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens intermediate turns. Nothing meaningful threatens failure, so the middle reads like a graceful montage rather than pressured plot. Still, the final before/after of the orchard’s awakening with his death as cost is legible and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous pilgrimage from path to tower to pedestal, ending in a clear realization, with causal beats that make sense (following footprints → reaching convergence point → offering amber → revelation). Closure is present as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: he abandons skepticism and reframes “homecoming.” However, the central turn relies heavily on the amber’s almost magical activation and an interior proclamation, with little resistance or complication en route. The result feels coherent but somewhat under-pressured for high-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: reef dies → concord broken → battlefield poisoned → coachman travels, seeds, and sings → years-later garden and reef renewal → final visit. Structure is linear with one long mission shard and a time-jump payoff; closure clearly lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the world has changed because of his actions. However, the middle lacks complications or real obstacles; once the premise is stated, everything proceeds smoothly without a meaningful turn that tests options. Cost is implied in effort and loneliness but never sharply dramatized in a way that tightens tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: leaf → riddle → decoding the grooves → journey → second phonograph → coordinate shift → reunion. The piece maintains a single drive lens (causal quest) and lands a clear closure unit: he reaches Elara and conceptually redefines “distance” and “home.” Some important beats (the physical journey and its hazards) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of cost and narrowing of options. Still, there is a meaningful mid-turn at the second cylinder where new knowledge changes his course rather than mere completion of an already-fixed path.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single, continuous ritual scene that gradually accumulates reflection, fitting an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is simple but coherent: anniversary → star chart ritual → contemplation → reframed understanding of her role. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and while it works, the before/after line is conceptually modest and low-stakes. There are no orientation issues, but the middle does not introduce a meaningful new pressure or turn beyond deepening the same notes.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow—wrong sky → climb spire → sequential chess-piece trials → confrontation with master → activation of sundial → restored sky—delivering a clear Decisive Change. Structure is linear and coherent, with each chamber functioning as a discrete, logical beat. However, escalation lacks complication or meaningful setback: each puzzle solves neatly on the first try, and the master’s arrival simplifies rather than deepens the conflict. Cost at closure is asserted conceptually (“most important undertaking”) but not strongly felt in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walking patterns → engagement with the pawn-less board → the new pawn’s appearance → her acceptance of ongoing duty. Causality is legible in the lyric frame (her “witness” pattern unbinds a memory), and the closure offers a resonant charged poise as she stands watch over the pawn, mission renewed with visible cost. However, escalation is gentle and there’s only one clear turn (the pawn’s materialization), so the overall arc feels more meditative than pressurized. The bracketed Chinese “needs correction” notes are textual artifacts that slightly fracture immersion but don’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the stone → realization of buried talents → nightly practice with feather → growing “thunder” → rotunda climax and conceptual revelation. Causality is broadly intact, but the turns happen with little resistance or complication, so the path feels smooth rather than pressured. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of “home,” legible and on the page, though the cost is mostly implied (she abandons old notions) rather than concretely dramatized. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph; no structural confusion, but also no particularly sharp structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: the four-minute lull permits action; decoding and restoring the tapestry threads opens the labyrinth; entering leads to confrontation and reconciliation with the prince, which restarts time. The dominant drive lens is Causal with a reflective overlay, and closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change in both the world (time restarts) and his internal stance (self-pardon). The forty-year constraint and the daily window are well integrated as persistent prices shaping his tactics. A slight sense of inevitability—no meaningful doubt that his final attempt will succeed—softens structural tension but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: repeated dawn sessions build toward a final act on the bone tower, and closure lands as a conceptual victory (the echoes refracting truth) despite uncertain personal fate. Causality is clean—her clandestine gatherings lead to overseer attention and a looming ritual—but most beats are summarized rather than dramatized, so we never see pressure tighten in real time. The closure unit functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains largely hypothetical. Orientation (who/where/when, what the ritual is) is solid and early.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: key charm → approach to statue → narrated memories → reframing into kintsugi. Causality is internally consistent, and the final conceptual shift (uncertainty reframed as preparation) provides a clear before/after under an accumulative/textural lens. Stakes remain primarily internal and reflective, with no strong external pivot, which limits structural impact but doesn’t break closure. The scene’s movements are logically sequenced and oriented without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: long-term nostalgia and a latent promise → restlessness at a diminished harbor → wrong turn to cave → discovery of his old shell → renewed purpose at the quay. The structure is essentially two scenes (quay/cave → quay again) with reflection woven in, and the final act of painting provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Stakes are small-scale but legible—creative and existential rather than plot-driven—and the cost (years of fading memory and grief) is implied more than dramatized in the present. The piece could escalate slightly more sharply around the discovery to heighten the sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: studies → secret method → dawn experiment → distant response → Captain’s shift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Elias’s belief is validated and the relationship with the Captain softens, and the “returning vibration” provides a satisfying echo. The coincidence of the sister’s exact reception is accepted as part of the magical premise rather than a plot hole, but the story avoids any material complication or setback once the experiment begins. Structure is solid but a bit frictionless, keeping it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is clean: a night at the station, the midnight call, and the arrival of a ship form a coherent window with a clear before/after and a quiet closure. Causality is intact—hydraulics fail → human navigation → cryptic calls → building channels → safe return—but escalation is modest and largely foregone-conclusion. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the navigator recommits to this endless work with renewed purpose. The lack of a serious complication or threatened failure keeps the arc from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: solitude → ritual with the relic → emotional relief → discovery of the second eye → conceptual reframing of the relics’ purpose. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: understanding the relics as tools for intentional navigation rather than simple shields, which reweights everything prior and motivates her decision to help others. The main weakness is that opposition is mostly theoretical—authorities and the dangers of connection are talked about but never press concretely on the scene, so escalation stays modest even as structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: apparition → object → influx of memories → investigation → interpretive closure at the dock, all under a single causal throughline. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with causal support, and the final act of placing the Edelweiss and mirroring the gesture is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration marking a before/after in his isolation. Stakes and cost are primarily conceptual and emotional but legible. The only thing holding this back from higher bands is that the investigation and its resolution unfold without any real structural surprise or sharp constraint; everything works as expected.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: chip → vision → ants → journey → cavern → symbolic doorways → choice → altered return. Closure lands as a decisive change in his relationship to solitude and purpose, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The “days passed” travel ellipsis is efficient, not evasive, and the structure holds under a causal lens with one main tightening at the cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: warning → dream urgency → clandestine departure → climb → grotto revelation → reoriented return, with no orientation issues. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure, as Elara reframes her role and the grotto as an ongoing secret refuge. However, the “final warning” and supposed danger of the ridge never meaningfully test her on the page, so stakes and cost feel under-leveraged. Structurally, it’s solid but conservative, without a particularly sharp turning point beyond the grotto’s explanation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the nexus, build-up to Leo’s secret, the moment of revelation, and Elara’s new artistic directive, all in a continuous scene under an accumulative/lyric drive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what her pocket-suns are meant to capture, and the before/after line is legible. However, the secret itself is withheld and its consequences are summarized more than dramatized, softening the felt cost of the turn. Causality is coherent, but the central beat works more as declared significance than as a fully pressured pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: cabin → engagement with scroll → visionary “soaring” → return and recommitment. Causality is soft but legible (scroll + aurora → vision; vision → renewed understanding of his role), and orientation is clean throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he returns to the same practice with deepened awareness rather than a new external situation. The main limitation is that the structural turn doesn’t significantly alter his options or impose a new constraint; the before/after is more tonal than materially different.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: loss of smell → new vocation → lost heirloom returns → conversation reframes both women’s roles. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with a clear single scene framed by the fog and the steady clocks, and closure via a resonant reconfiguration when Elara’s stance toward her loss shifts. However, the stakes never truly pinch; Lena’s problem is resolved without serious obstacle, and Elara’s internal shift isn’t forced by any hard turn. The closure works, but it feels more like a well-shaped vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: limited calm between storms → setup of ritual → memory work enabling rune-writing → platform tilt and onset of crystallization → renewed use of superstition to complete the task. The single-scene structure is coherent and the closure—a completed transformation and safely stored parchment as the storm hits—lands with a clear before/after. The tilt of the platform is a slightly mechanical-feeling escalation beat, but it still reads as situational pressure rather than contrivance. Cost is legible in the risk of bodily crystallization and the narrow timing window, though the resolution is smooth enough to feel a touch low-friction for elite-market stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: Eloise prepares the ritual, triggers Beatrice’s appearance, attempts apology/connection, and the orchard’s demolition window cuts the encounter short. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Eloise shifts from unresolved guilt to a costly, partial peace symbolized by the incomplete sheet music. Stakes and constraints (time before the trees are cut, fragility of the induced-current ritual) are legible without over-explaining. Structure is tight for a single-scene piece, with no orientation issues and a satisfying, if quiet, cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: wandering → discovery of the library’s center → altar scene → completion and reconfiguration form a clear before/after. Causality is intact at a conceptual level (because the witness gathers truths, they can inscribe them; because the hiccup peaks, the act must happen now). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/RR when library, witness, and dictionary unify into a new cosmos-seeding hush, though the exact cost of failure or success remains abstract. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the pattern of lyric accumulation holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean, single-POV structure with a legible present scene (the reverse-flow experiment) followed by a telescoped future that shows the consequences of that moment. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the counting backward and imagery of reversed hydraulics deepen the central question of what time is rather than drive a causal plot. Closure comes via a conceptual repricing: Arlo reframes time as meaning/presence and lives differently thereafter, which is clear on the page. Stakes and cost are modest and mostly conceptual, so the structure feels accomplished but not yet urgent or gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is linear and coherent: observation → experimental activation → contact → reinterpretation → new partnership. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “intrusion” into “mutual guardianship,” and that shift is on the page. However, causality is mostly soft; events proceed without obstacles or meaningful uncertainty once the device is activated. The cost of the change (what she gives up or risks) is only lightly implied and not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: present in the library, backstory of the father and heart attack, the subway discovery, and a final reframing of her mission. Causality is light but coherent—subway scrawls lead to recognition of the encryption, which prompts a conceptual shift from decoding messages to reinterpreting assumptions. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of probability and her pilgrimage, with a discernible before/after in her stance and mood. Escalation is modest, mostly reflective rather than situational, but structurally sound for a quiet, lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a lyric setup of his underground life, the first wrong-number call with Meredith as inciting/turning event, then a concise coda of his changed pattern. Causality is intact—Meredith’s call causes the reconfiguration of his “cultivated estrangement.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tunnel shifts from prison to sanctuary, his role from passive to purposefully open. The main limitation is that the central conversation—where the deepest shift would happen—is summarized instead of partially dramatized, softening structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: arrival at the jetty, preparation of the final solution, the drawing, then the decision to leave. Causality is modest but coherent—the imminent digitization motivates his final analog ritual, which culminates in a charged departure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he accepts forward motion while carrying his analog covenant at a clear emotional cost. Stakes stay small and interior, but the arc never loses orientation or meanders.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Archie conceives a hoax, seeds it through a taxi driver, and the narrative tracks outwards through rumor to a cultural phenomenon before closing back on him. Time jumps (fifteen minutes, three days, week’s end) are handled coherently and the Global Drive Lens feels Hybrid—causal scaffolding with a conceptual closure. Closure is present in his realization that the cure is the sharing, not the object, but the cost is underplayed: the ethical and personal risks of the deception remain largely notional. The piece thus feels structurally sound but somewhat low-pressure for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story uses a mostly accumulative/textural structure: Elion follows sensory cues deeper into the forest until he reaches the stillpoint, where a resonant reconfiguration occurs. Causality is simple but coherent (constellation pause → opportunity; ring + forest → trail; trail → stillpoint → inner shift), and there is clear closure. However, the journey unfolds without real uncertainty or reversal—once he begins, nothing seriously threatens his success, which flattens structural tension. The reflective backstory is integrated but leans toward exposition rather than turning present options.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: past error → motivation to fix → attempt with the pen → small but concrete correction via Sarah → renewed commitment. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear present-time attempt framed by a brief backstory shard, and the closure unit (RR) is legible. However, the story never tightens options or complicates the attempt; the history-edit works smoothly on the first try, so the sense of cost or risk in the resolution remains conceptual rather than felt. This keeps the piece from landing as structurally gripping at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: a single continuous scene in which encounters layer until the harbor “sings.” Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s voice is awakened and Elias’s forgottenness is reweighted as the conceptual cost. Causality is simple but intact (he arrives to disrupt silence → engages figures → transformed atmosphere), and orientation is clear. The arc is relatively flat in terms of turns, so the before/after line is more conceptual than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clear: tapestry fragment → archive → artistic trail → hidden message → restoration → founding a new library, and closure lands cleanly with a decisive life reorientation. Structure skews summary-heavy, telescoping “weeks” and then “years” into a montage that flattens moment-to-moment pressure. There is a meaningful before/after—arsonist to archivist—but the decisive turns (choosing to stay underground, rebuilding) are largely asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Still, the drive lens (causal with accumulative reflection) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: habitual drumming → engineered four-minute outage → corridor escape → tower performance → Theo’s manifested presence → reconfigured understanding of entanglement. The story maintains a single POV, one continuous night scene with backstory woven in, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard plot turn. Stakes and constraints (time window, security systems) are sketched but not deeply dramatized in the ending—no on-page repercussion beyond “monitoring systems flickered back to life.” That softens the sense of concrete cost but doesn’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Marlo’s plan to test whispers, use of maps/coin, timing Vance’s rounds, and the pre-whispered directions reaching security all line up. The piece has a clear beginning (decision to challenge), middle (setup and execution), and end (quiet victory and new map), with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a modest Decisive Change—Vance’s method is undercut, Marlo’s expertise subtly ascends—but the cost and stakes are quite low, more a clever demonstration than a pressured turning point. Some setup elements (like the key) don’t significantly alter outcomes, creating slight overpromising relative to payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: one continuous night on the dock, leading from patterned work to a charged, silent encounter and a quiet parting. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—the secret remains unspoken but “transformed,” and the visitor’s burden eases—but the cost and before/after line are muted. There is little in the way of escalation or structural turn beyond “visitor approaches / visitor departs more at peace,” which keeps the arc flat. Still, the guardian’s intensified work before dawn and the final star pattern provide a discernible, if gentle, cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clean: Arthur perceives a problem, consults the grotto, devises window puzzles, and the town’s mindset begins to shift. Structure is straightforward and easily followed, with a clear before/after and a satisfying, if gentle, closure. However, the plan faces no real resistance or setbacks—everything works on schedule, undercutting a sense of jeopardy or cost. This lack of friction keeps the piece from feeling structurally robust enough for a highly competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: find scrimshaw → text emerges → ritual with whale song → island appears → departure, with a clear before/after. Causal links are legible and closure lands via Mara’s decisive act of diving toward the island, foreclosing her dock life. Some middle beats are compressed (“Days passed as she studied the scrimshaw”) rather than dramatized, softening escalation but not breaking coherence. The world rule “after violence became impossible” is introduced but never structurally engaged, feeling like unused setup.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—ritual acts layered with brief mandate history—builds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration in the final paragraphs. Orientation is strong from the opening (farmhouse, turbines, performer) and never slips. Closure lands as a clear conceptual and emotional before/after: the happiness mandate’s binaries are reweighted into permitted complexity. The main limitation is that the on-page present remains largely static in circumstance; the decisive shift is conceptual rather than situational or choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: ban lifts → poet journeys to colonnade → ritual with quartz → transformation → return with new mission, and closure is a decisive change in status and purpose. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with accumulative intensification of humming/light leading into the gateway moment. However, the price of this transformation is never sharply defined, so the before/after is conceptually clear but emotionally low-cost. The accumulative drive lens holds, but the lack of friction keeps the plot from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean, causal through-line: Elara’s long-prepared arrangement triggers the courtyard’s awakening, which enables the trade that reconfigures Gideon’s relationship to his craft and unexpectedly restores her color perception. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in both Gideon’s and Elara’s inner worlds—with the bartered awakening premise paid off on the page. The main structural limitation is that almost all the “work” (weeks of preparation, prior dire consequences) is told as prelude rather than unfolding under present-time pressure. Cost is conceptual and thematic rather than acutely felt in the moment, keeping the arc from fully landing as a hard turn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens and delivers a modest Conceptual Repricing: the realization that objects are vessels of experience, not silent witnesses. Causality is extremely light—she places the lens, activates the device, listens, and reaffirms her quest—so the structural spine relies on repetition rather than turns. Closure is legible but low-cost: her understanding deepens, yet no option is foreclosed or materially reweighted. The overall arc holds together, but it reads more as a lyrical vignette than a story with robust structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece reads as an accumulative portrait rather than a scene, with a coherent throughline from loss to quiet redemption. Causality is mostly retrospective summary (“after her daughter’s passing… the observatory had found her then”) instead of dramatized turns, so there’s little sense of options narrowing in real time. Closure rests on a stated status (“she was no longer just a mourning jewelry maker”) rather than a fresh on-page shift. It lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but with low felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: a single coherent scene—visitor arrives, Elias chooses to reveal his work, they collaborate, the visitor reframes its significance—which yields a clear conceptual before/after. The drive lens reads primarily as accumulative/textural, with causal beats linking smoothly. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (this isn’t just analysis of collapse, it may prevent future crashes), but the cost of that repricing remains mostly implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the outset, with no spatial or temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene that moves from arrival to ritual to transcendence with a clear before/after: Elara enters as a seeker and leaves as the archive’s vessel. Causality under a textural lens holds: her method (pattern-avoidance) leads to activation, visions, and ultimately merger. The cost of losing her prior self is implied and legible in the closing paragraphs. Escalation is more experiential than plot-driven but still coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—observation → anomaly recognition → longitudinal study → confrontation → reconfiguration—reads cleanly and coherently. Time jumps (“In the years since…,” “Night after night…”) are legible and support the sense of long vigil rather than obscuring orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “anomaly” is re-priced as love’s persistence, with an accompanying emotional cost. The main limitation is that turns rely more on revealed information than on pressured choice, which keeps the causal pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: single POV, single location, a reflective arc that accumulates toward a quiet, internal reconfiguration. Causality is mostly emotional/reflective rather than event-driven, but the throughline from betrayal revelation → care for the chameleon → conceptual reconstruction is legible. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she adopts a new stance on trust that will guide future choices, with the chameleon’s healed tail and dawn as the cadence shift. The cost of that shift is somewhat underplayed on the page, more asserted than dramatized, which keeps the piece from feeling structurally decisive at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: wake → notice objects/patterns → decode method → open tunnel → return miracle → reframe self. Closure lands as a decisive conceptual and identity shift with a clear before/after and a legible reconfiguration of the premise. However, the journey through the tunnel and the act of “returning” the miracle are compressed and almost frictive-free, so the structural escalation feels more like a smooth revelation than a pressured choice with consequence. The accumulative pattern of motifs is coherent, but an additional concrete obstacle or cost in the tunnel would strengthen the ending’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: she prepares the film, performs the reading, has a realization, and then threads the projector with a reweighted understanding. Causality is more emotional than event-driven, but the before/after is legible—she moves from seeking where unused love is stored to articulating a specific answer. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of “unused love” and of the film itself. Still, escalation is fairly linear and smooth, without a distinct structural turn or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: arrive at threshold → engage ritual with the instrument → achieve an internal reconfiguration → depart with renewed purpose. The accumulative/lyric drive is coherent and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her relationship to input and creativity is meaningfully reweighted. Causality is soft but intact—nothing breaks, though beats blur slightly into a smooth ascent of insight rather than sharply stepped turns. The cost (lost time, psychic strain) is acknowledged enough to make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is linear and legible: train → dune → archive → renewed departure, with motifs (clock, dune, archive) stitched cleanly through. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure lands via the clock’s tick and his admission that he may now dream, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior imagery. Stakes and costs remain fairly abstract—there’s never a concrete risk of failure—so the felt price of success is more conceptual than visceral. Nonetheless, the before/after of stasis vs. movement in time is clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is legible: sixth sense → waking with moss → gear arrival → decoding tree-wind → revelation that the forest is his mind → dream-integration → renewed, intentional exploration. Structure is essentially linear with one clear transition (waking world to dream and back) and a coherent closure where his stance toward his ability reconfigures. However, the turns are low-pressure; obstacles never complicate tactics, and the “probable miracles” arrive without real friction or cost. Closure lands conceptually, but without the tightening or sacrifice that would make it feel decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: leash breaks → decision to depart → indirect traversal → cavern of dragons → return to shore with new mandate, a clean Conceptual Repricing. Causality holds within the mythic logic, and the closure is legible, but the journey faces no substantive resistance or decision-point that might tighten options or add cost. The result is a smooth, lovely arc that feels slightly under-dramatized for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is clear early: a bellhop in a cobalt fortress under snow, descending a spiral staircase to deliver luggage. Causality flows cleanly from tripping on the stair → discovering the bolt and etchings → realizing the fortress’s origin → choosing to sing, with the closure delivering a decisive change and conceptual reweighting of “safety.” The revelation that “his nerve damage had been no accident” is a mild convenience but doesn’t break coherence. The ending’s cost is more implied than enacted (no immediate consequence to breaking the silence), which limits how hard the closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: exile → research via runes → escalating messages → collapsing library → ritual → revelation. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: the “antagonist” is internal, and this reweights the entire throne-quest. The cost—the relinquishing of a royal identity and the library’s dissolution—is legible, though mostly in conceptual rather than visceral terms. The structure leans heavily on summary over dramatized beats, which keeps the arc coherent but blunts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the atlas page → investigation and comparison → sleepless pattern-hunting → conceptual realization and quiet closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each pass over data, maps, and tapping deepens the core idea of delayed revelation. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: humanity’s “paths” recast as temporary impositions the Earth is erasing, with the journal entry marking a new stance. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and emotional, so the cost is felt but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: she walks through the spaceport, discovers the stone circle, enters it, and undergoes a transformation. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative/textural lens, and orientation is clear from the opening sentence onward. Closure is present via a conceptual reconfiguration (from seeking meaning to embodying it), but the cost is diffuse and mostly abstract—there’s little concrete narrowing of options or tangible consequence to ground the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: plant-whispers → cave discovery → embryo → search for key → kite script → decoding → opening the chamber. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, with a clear before/after anchored on unsealing the embryo. However, many difficulties are compressed into summary (“eluded her for weeks”), so the on-page struggle and cost of solving the key feel underdeveloped. Closure is conceptually sound but lacks a concrete, dramatized price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: daily ritual → teaching children → anniversary at the cliff, culminating in the photo’s release as closure (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Causality is modest but sufficient; each section naturally leads into the next and deepens the same drive rather than branching out. The closure has on-page cost (letting go of the photo) and reconfigures her relationship to past and present. No orientation issues, and backstory is well anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear object-driven progression (blocked drawing → discovery of box → thread work → renewed drawing) that supports an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is simple but intact, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where she reconceives fragmentation as something to embrace. Cost is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off, which keeps the ending from feeling fully weighty. Orientation is excellent from the opening and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causality is clean: eclipse → anomalous time → research → ink experiment → temporal displacement → return and conceptual shift. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with a brief, anchored backstory interlude, and the closure beat (realization about time’s nature) is legible and tied to what just happened. Cost is present in the dangerous vitals and physical distress, though not heavily dramatized. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual coda, and that hybrid holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: power fluctuation → thawed sector → discovery of letter → ethical dilemma → decision → upload → charged waiting. Closure is solidly on the page: once the document is sent, her life’s orientation has irrevocably changed, and she sits to await consequences. The structure is linear and coherent, but fairly straightforward, with no complicating turns after the inciting discovery beyond her reflection. Cost is implied more than dramatized (no hint of concrete counter-moves yet), but the charged poise of the ending works.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: one continuous scene framed by routine with interleaved backstory. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds a consistent pattern—garden labor, world collapse context, father’s legacy—but there is minimal causal development. Closure exists as quiet earned stasis (“another day’s work complete”), yet no on-page event significantly alters options or knowledge. Stakes and cost remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → weaving/net-making → descent of the echo → containment and aftermath. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent, and the closure (he succeeds in capturing the echo, altering both himself and the cosmos) lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is more conceptual than felt—this rare, dangerous moment never quite tightens into a decision with visible sacrifice. Still, the story maintains a single throughline without orientation issues or broken rules.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal drive is straightforward: journalist’s call → retreat to observatory → analytical work → discovery → decision to call back. However, the actual investigative turn (“finally had it”) is summarized rather than dramatized, so the key structural beat is told, not shown. Closure exists—she resolves to expose the real culprit—but the cost and the investigative chain are thin on the page. The single-scene frame is coherent and temporally clear, but the climax feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present lab scene with interleaved backstory driving toward a single experiment that yields a tangible before/after (from unending cries to one restorative lullaby). Causality is strong: amber + letters → modified haunted firmware → temporal folding + tether → daughter’s lullaby → emotional reconfiguration. Closure is clear and on-page, with a decisive change in Elias’s relationship to his grief, marked by him tattooing a new constellation. The speculative leaps (time folding and firmware’s capabilities) are accepted with minimal friction, but pressure around things going wrong or partial failure is underdeveloped, softening the climactic beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival and setup of the grotto/flake, buildup through repeated mandala-making, a central confrontation with zealots, then a communal coda the next morning. Causality is coherent—his long practice enables the climactic intervention, and that intervention transforms the crowd’s stance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the unlearning and the hush are re-understood by the community, with the disassembly of the mandala sealing their temporariness. The main limitation is that the conflict resolves very smoothly, with little sense that another outcome was plausibly in play.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece functions as a single coherent scene with a clear drive: Elias discovers the tessera, reaches the central mosaic, performs the renaming ritual, and addresses the gathered survivors. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the plaza is renamed and reclaimed—is legible and on the page, with a before/after in how the space and people are framed. Causality is more accumulative than dramatic, but each step flows logically and there are no orientation issues. The cost of this act—his burden of grief and the tenuousness of hope—is implied rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the structural effect solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: ghost returns, uses coin and voice to heal a fractured timeline before dawn, restores garden, and gains rest. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change: the garden is saved and Silas dissolves, with the coin fading to mark cost and completion. The structure is essentially a single continuous ritual scene interwoven with memory, which fits the length. However, escalation is smooth rather than knotted—no real setbacks or turns complicate the straightforward “he sings and it works” progression, which keeps the plot from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal spine—telepathy pill disaster → static shock activates geode → Maya experiments → devises a protocol—is coherent and easy to follow. The piece reads largely as an accumulative montage within one night rather than a scene with a strong central turn, so escalation and payoff feel muted. Closure exists in her devising the protocol and reconfiguring her stance, but the cost is soft and mostly implied (exhaustion, brother’s ongoing suffering). Some repetition of beats (“after the static shock…”, pill recall summaries) lowers structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Maya descends because of her motivation, discovers the fossil, touches it, gains knowledge, and exits with a new purpose. The piece delivers closure via a conceptual repricing—realizing the fossil is a key to the Great Hibernation and redefining her role—but the stakes around that realization are mostly declarative. There’s little on-page testing of her goal or real obstruction in the cave, so the middle feels like a smooth passage rather than a pressured escalation. Structure is clean but a bit outline-like in its “and then” progression.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the echo jar leads to deciphering the prophecy via buttons, which leads to communal transformation of the warehouse. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after centered on Elara’s decision to reinterpret prophecy as possibility. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, but the process of “unscrambling” is narrated as almost effortless once she notices the buttons, softening any sense of difficulty or cost. The accumulative pattern of repetition (hourglasses, buttons, amber warehouse) is coherent but not especially tight or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: ritual on the bluff → engagement with pillbox/photo → internal crystallization → departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his fractures and chooses a new path with emotional cost. Causality is mostly internal but coherent, with no orientation issues. The scene remains somewhat static externally, so the structural “turn” feels more like a deepening than a sharpened hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single continuous ritualized scene that accumulates meaning cleanly and lands in a quiet but coherent closure as he completes the day’s “palimpsest promise” and moves on. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tightening comes mainly from the ticking gutters as a soft countdown and the gradual conceptual realization about crossings. There is, however, very little sense of options narrowing or stakes being tested; nothing threatens failure beyond time’s gentle passage. Closure works as a conceptual repricing of thresholds, but with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean arc: arrival → discovery of the glass → revelation of fractured timelines → reciprocal awakening of oasis → conceptual resolution about “resistance to change.” Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new phenomenon (thrum, smoke, phototropic flowers) deepening the same central inquiry rather than branching. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “resistance to change” reframed as “loyal memory of love,” plus Kael’s decision to return. The main weakness is the low felt cost—no path is truly foreclosed, so the before/after shift is intellectual rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: rose petal drops → decision → harbor journey → alcove encounter → illumination and recognition, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each move deepens the central drive to reflect light, and the closure—a charged poise in the glowing alcove at dawn—lands clearly. Causality is intact but mild; nothing meaningfully resists Mara, and there’s no hard test of her aim. The cost at closure is largely conceptual (accepting a calling) rather than dramatized as sacrifice, which keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a smooth, single-arc lyric progression from disorientation after the reincarnation memory to a new equilibrium of coexistence with the library. Causality is soft but coherent: touching the Oracular Mirror leads to the flood of past lives; the hum of the stone circle deepens as a method for coexistence; touching the reflective wall at “midnight” crystallizes closure. The closure beat—a reconfigured stance where her internal clock replaces the sundial—is legible but light on cost, with stakes remaining largely conceptual rather than pressured by concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is simple and legible: journey to temple → encounter with installation → focus on thrush’s nest → realization → decision to write differently. The accumulative/textural lens fits: the piece builds atmosphere and reflection rather than causal obstacles, and the closure moment (attention as the sought “thread”) is on the page. However, the middle is somewhat flat, reiterating her profession and emptiness rather than introducing new pressures or turns, and the final change mostly reframes her mindset rather than clearly foreclosing options with visible cost. Still, orientation is strong and the conceptual repricing at the end is clear enough for a functional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: months of analysis → recalibrated transmitter → interference → signal blackout → social easing and institutional acknowledgment. The structure (night operation plus a compressed “over the next week” aftermath) is straightforward and legible, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: Elara has altered the game and now stands at the threshold of an ongoing struggle. The main weakness is that key consequences (town tensions easing, Merrick’s reversal) are summarized rather than given any concrete scene pressure, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: secret journey → nexus → ritual → portal → choice to step through. Orientation is strong—who, where, and when are clear early, and the rules around the fallow period and Great Sealing provide understandable constraints. Closure is a decisive change (she opens a non-surface portal and crosses it), with an intelligible revaluation of what the “key” truly is. The main limitation is that the cost and consequences of this choice remain largely conceptual rather than dramatized, so the climax, while structurally sound, feels somewhat low-friction for the scale of stakes declared.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is legible: a lone ribbon fragment leads Elena to request documents, cross-reference, narrow suspects, and infer the killer, culminating in a confession. However, the leap from fabric match to “only one guest had commissioned custom masks” to visualizing the assistant as killer feels compressed and somewhat convenient, and the decisive confrontation and confession are entirely off-page. Closure exists (case solved, community reconfigured), but the decisive change is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: anomaly → journals → decoded stanza → nail-activated panel → hidden system → initiation. The piece lands a clear closure unit (Decisive Change / Charged Poise) when Eli actually initiates the ancestor’s sequence, reconfiguring the situation. Cost is mostly conceptual and implied rather than sharply dramatized in the final beat. Structure is linear and clean, with backstory woven in without breaking orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: hitchhiker vanishes → observation and glass flake → recounting triggers the scaffold map → ascent toward another dimension, with closure at his committed crossing. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens; recounting and attention seem to activate the bridge. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration, but the felt cost of this decisive change is faint—his departure reads almost frictionless. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the throughline is easy to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a clear, linear mosaic: past (rise) and present (fall) interleaved, all under Elias’s POV, and closure lands with him leaving the circus train and conceptually repricing his journey. However, most major events (startup rise, investor backlash, bankruptcy) are summarized instead of dramatized, so causal tightening is felt more as report than as lived escalation. The Marcus confrontation promises a hinge but doesn’t materially alter the trajectory—we glide from “trying to dissuade” to “as the startup unwound” without a concrete turning action. The before/after is legible, but the decisive shifts mostly occur offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: recurring dreams → telegram → telescope observation of variable stars → pattern match → collaboration with Thorne → decoding → activation of healing language. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in understanding; closure lands as a Decisive Change in knowledge and capability. However, the path is almost frictionless, with no meaningful setback, false lead, or cost, so the decisive change feels too easily earned. The “shared burden” solution arrives without serious resistance from either circumstance or character.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: failed trick → mentor trapped → vortex descent → expanding-circle investigation → seed-powered unbending → revelation and release. The expanding circles provide a clear structural spine that escalates information about the confession in an orderly way. Closure lands with a decisive change (mentor freed, glamour dropped) and a conceptual repricing (identity as confession), though the cost and danger remain relatively soft. Repetition in the middle (serial circles with similar beats) slightly dulls the sense of mounting risk.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is legible: covenant broken → visionary hears of method → ritual → maze → revelation → new understanding. The structure is essentially one smooth arc with no meaningful setbacks; everything the protagonist attempts works on the first try. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (what the covenant truly is) but the shift feels told rather than experienced under pressure. The lack of obstacles or alternatives undermines the sense of earned transformation despite a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: Elara enters with a task, invokes the card, confronts the rogue sorrow, contains it, and returns to vigil, forming a coherent arc with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Causality is straightforward—her ritual choices lead to resolution—and orientation (who/where/what) is secure early. The cost of her bargain is implied more than dramatized, so the climax reads smooth rather than tight. Still, the before/after—unbalanced vs. restored orchard and renewed commitment—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the scrap prompts technical scrutiny, which opens into layered backstory, culminating in a quiet but clear reconfiguration of self (“reclaiming a piece of himself”). Causality is intact and legible, with the foreman’s question giving the external beat that crystallizes the internal shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with a clear before/after in how Marcus relates to his work and failure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear: spirit’s departure → reflection on lineage and arbor → analogical reasoning → decision and departure, with a quiet but legible closure in the charged final boarding image (RR/Charged Poise under a largely accumulative lens). Causality is intact, and the baton-passing from spirit to Elara functions cleanly as inciting shift. The main limitation is that stakes and cost at closure remain mostly conceptual and projected into the future, so the before/after line is emotionally soft rather than sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, ritual-structured pattern early and sustains it cleanly: preparation → smelting → tidal immersion → new synthesis. Orientation is strong from the first lines and the single-scene continuity is easy to follow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where being both librarian and library is conceptually reweighted, though the cost of this stance remains largely abstract. The lack of concrete obstacles or consequences somewhat flattens the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: bunker inspection → secret passage → discovery/ritual → re-emergence with a new purpose, with a solid conceptual closure (redefining “end of the world” as disconnection). Causality is straightforward—each step follows from the previous discovery—and the global drive reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative. However, the path is almost too smooth: no serious obstacle or complication tests her commitment, and the transformation sequence feels like an unopposed ascent. Closure lands, but with limited sense of cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—research → station → bathroom graffiti → schematic comparison → descent → river ritual—is clean, legible, and accumulates toward a coherent closure. The ending offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s stance toward her guilt and grief shifts in a way that feels materially different from the opening. Structure is linear and contained; the backstory is anchored to present stimuli and does not fracture orientation. The main limitation is a lack of complication or reversal: the path unfolds almost too smoothly, so while closure is solid, the journey feels somewhat preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → watch → cipher fragments → forest → library → time-limited exploration → exit, with no serious orientation issues. The piece uses a predominantly causal lens with light lyric inflection, and the closure—leaving the library changed, with knowledge preserved only in the journal—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the library’s disappearance and the permanent secrecy of the gained knowledge. The structure is essentially one continuous arc with an effective tightening via the vibrating watch and implied second letter, though the latter remains more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: empire’s impending claim → divination → catastrophic vision → reinterpretation of “perforated destiny” → propagation ritual → hollow victory for the Empire. The piece holds a mostly causal drive with some lyric accumulation, and closure clearly registers as a decisive change plus a conceptual repricing (the violin’s “destiny” becomes reproductive rather than teleological). Stakes are introduced early and paid off without teleporting props or rule-breaking; the greenhouse, ice structure, and psychic plants all feed the solution. Cost is legible in the damaged original violin and Elara’s acceptance of a bittersweet, covert win.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: preparation, ritual, completion, and shelving of the emerald, closing on her ongoing purpose. Causality is simple but intact—each step of the ritual follows from the last, and the sister backstory deepens rather than derails the present scene. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has preserved this story and recommits to continuing. The main limitation is the lack of a strong structural turn or complication that would reconfigure options or knowledge in a more dramatic way.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: climb → grotto entry → progression inward → central chamber realization → descent, with backstory folded in legibly. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, and closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration when Elara reframes contentment as internal rather than sought. Causality holds at the scale this piece chooses, though many beats are reflective rather than decisively turned. The cost of the ending stance (what she gives up or risks by becoming the source) is more implied than sharply etched, which keeps this out of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: campfire dilemma → ascent and divination → advice → aftermath and reflection, all in one continuous causal arc. The drive lens reads as primarily Situational with an Accumulative texture—pressure is the moral situation, and the chime ritual plus reflection deepen rather than sharply turn it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elian reaffirms his role and philosophy with a felt cost (“weight of all the consciences”) and prepares for the next client. Stakes and cost are modest but coherent, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear: Elien brings Maya, stages the exercise, withholds information, then reveals the grotto to land the thematic turn. The story has a coherent beginning (arrival/lesson setup), middle (stone, ripples, trance), and end (revelation and partial transformation), with an identifiable closure in Maya’s new understanding and Elien’s gained decade. However, the cost and stakes of that closure feel lightly sketched, and some beats (“Through the patterns…wisdom emerges”) are restated rather than escalated. Structure is solid but not yet sharpened to elite-level precision or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is linear and legible: arrowhead’s call → observation of crows → movement to canyon heart → ritual placement → disappearance. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the closure—a reconfiguration where Kael vanishes and the arrowhead becomes a guide—is clear and conceptually satisfying. Causality is mostly “and then” rather than “therefore,” with external signs (crows, resonant depression) appearing conveniently rather than through struggle. The cost of the ending (Kael’s absence) is implied but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery in the archives → forbidden mist walking → finding the folly → unstrapping the Pack → keystone activation → altered stance and subtle social ripple. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the first paragraph and the single-quest structure fits the length. The main weakness is the near-absence of concrete obstacles or reversals; everything he attempts works on the first try, so tension is low even as closure is conceptually satisfying. The ending delivers a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—Elias’s relation to magic and the spire’s atmosphere are reweighted—but the lack of resistance softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: festival → key discovery → lighthouse door → sunken library → revelation → return with a vow. Closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing of his gift and a new mandate symbolized by the key dissolving into his skin and the multicolored lamplights. However, the journey unfolds with minimal complication or resistance; each threshold opens almost on first touch. The structure is elegant and legible but lacks a decisive beat of jeopardy or sacrifice that would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward: the universe is contracting, prophecy demands a choice, Loran interprets static and coins, then triggers the broadcast that aligns humanity with the rebirth. Closure is present and legible—the before/after hinge is his interpretation of the spiral and the subsequent action—but the path to that understanding feels somewhat convenient, with the “backwards prophecy” and complex method mostly asserted rather than dramatized in detail. The scene remains anchored in one place and time with no orientation issues. The conceptual cost of failure is clear (humanity’s extinction), but the price at closure is more implied than emotionally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment naming work is interwoven with concise backstory and Elara memories, all anchored in a single observatory night. Causality is modest but coherent—finding the recordings shifts him, leading to the naming project and the emotional release. Closure lands clearly with his departure at dawn lighter in step, a Decisive Change in stance that is legible and on-page. The emotional cost (centuries of pain reconfigured rather than erased) is implied but not deeply probed in the final beats, keeping it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: ruined bell → failed world → dripping pattern → obsessive study → reconstruction → restored balance. The piece holds a single scene with embedded context and pays off on-page with a Decisive Change (the bell restored, the sea reawakening). Structure is straightforward and legible; there are no orientation issues or rule-breaking conveniences. The main limitation is that the climax resolves almost as soon as he begins the weaving, with little sense of real risk, delay, or near-failure to sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the receding water and silent chime lead to the discovery of the label, which prompts archival digging, the photograph trail, the aunt’s revelation, and then his decision to act. The structure is straightforward but effective, and closure is present in his concrete choice to contact historians/journalists and petition for recognition. Cost is implied (challenging bureaucracy and his own past narrative) though not made viscerally sharp. The single reflective flashback block via photos is anchored and doesn’t break orientation or lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a simple causal spine—enter orchard → charge crystal via starlings → transform crystal over flame → leave with new state of being—without confusion. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she has successfully completed the prerequisite harmonization before the later “final transformation.” Yet there is almost no on-page resistance or risk; every step works as expected, so the before/after line is conceptually neat but dramatically low-cost. The “before the final transformation” frame hints at a larger arc but functions more as a teaser than a structural pressure inside this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is essentially linear: vigilance → anomalous message → recognition of emergency → decision to transmit, with a clear closure beat when they finally speak. This supports an accumulative, lyric drive lens, but escalation is modest and heavily told—“anomalies that contradicted established patterns” never become concrete events. Closure lands as a Charged Poise, yet the cost is almost entirely conceptual, with little on-page consequence or narrowed option space. The repetition of refrains (“After the radio static cleared…”) gives pattern but also highlights how little actually changes beat to beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Maya must vivify the duplicate before the next history rewrite, attempts the complementary-opposites method, and succeeds as the temporal wave peaks, reconfiguring both her and the brain’s status. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear escalation toward the temporal crescendo and the glow/awakening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the brain becomes an autonomous claimant and Maya embraces feeling and a new role. Some stakes (corporate battle, legal/public fallout) stay mostly in exposition rather than feeding back into on-page choices, which slightly blunts structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: storm aftermath → mysterious seed arrival → examination → reflection → planting and resolution. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds a contemplative mood more than a causal chain, but the seed does function as an inciting incident. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing—she reframes her work via the corpse flower metaphor—but the lack of tangible cost keeps it mild. Nothing breaks causality, but the arc feels more like a meditation than a shaped story.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean single scene: preparation, enactment of the “symphony,” inciting echo-giggle, and a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is straightforward—he uses the tunnel and lullabies to attack silence, which provokes the uncanny giggle and his subsequent stopping—and the closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: absence redefined as sanctuary rather than pure loss. Stakes and cost are legible but modest in scope, and the escalation is more textural than decisional. There are no major orientation or lens issues, but the plot pressure never tightens beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: long-term waiting, then the pendant’s energy intensifying, then an internalized magical act leading to a reconfigured state and departure. Causality is coherent (years of interiorizing + pendant’s residual magic → porous boundaries → transformation), and closure lands as a clear before/after shift. Stakes remain abstract and largely internal, which slightly blunts the sense of cost. Still, the structure cleanly builds to a resonant conceptual repricing of “home” and “uncertainty.”

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is clean: successive failed attempts culminate in a methodological realization and successful transformation, and closure is legible with a clear before/after. Structure is linear and coherent, anchored in one night’s work with a few backstory insertions that don’t disrupt orientation. Cost is conceptual—renouncing passive preservation and a “stifling destiny”—rather than materially dramatized, which slightly softens impact. Still, each beat reasonably follows from the last, and the ending decisively reconfigures his options and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrive, prepare, tune, succeed, depart, with causal linkage holding throughout. Closure is present—a successful attunement that yields new knowledge about cosmic rebirth—but the cost is minimal and mostly conceptual. Much of the middle is reflective and expository rather than driven by evolving obstacles, which keeps the escalation fairly flat. Still, for an accumulative/lyric piece, the before/after distinction in understanding is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: ferry transforms → spectral grotto → contact with counterpart → synchronized merging via hourglass and patterns → re-emergence in normal waters. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the first few lines, and the drive to merge timelines holds through closure. The closure beat—hourglass filling, ferries fusing, Liam redefined—lands clearly as a decisive change with conceptual cost. The main limitation is how smoothly everything unfolds, with no real structural complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is legible: architect creates dreamscape → sinew thread mutates → gallery becomes a collective unconscious → he touches it → enters fever dream → finds sister and reframes connection. Structure is cleanly linear with one major turn (the eruption/animation of the gallery) and a clear closure beat, but pressure rarely tightens; events feel more like a smooth unveiling than increasingly constrained options. The reunion arrives almost as soon as he steps through, without complication or real risk, which keeps the cost and dramatic weight of the ending modest. Orientation is strong and the chosen lens (causal with some accumulative texture) holds, but the arc is closer to a guided tour than a trial.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: Kael feels a gap, develops edge geometry, gathers circumstantial evidence, then receives external confirmation and teaches the result. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—the city’s navigation frame enlarges and Kael’s role reconfigures. However, most of this is conveyed in expository summary rather than dramatized beats, and the confirmation arrives conveniently off-stage. The cost of his pursuit remains abstract, so the before/after line is intellectually clear but only mildly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—hearing aid pulses → investigation → identification of predator pattern → security intervention → conceptual closure with grandmother’s photo—is clean and easy to follow. The piece maintains a single coherent scene with a brief, well-anchored backstory shard and lands in a genuine reconfiguration of Elena’s understanding of her grandmother’s death. That said, elements like the predator’s timely appearance and security’s frictionless response feel somewhat convenient and low-cost. Closure is present but not especially hard-won, which limits impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine (arrive at tide window → set up Codex → guide shadows → leave as tide returns) is clean and easy to follow, with orientation established quickly. The time constraint and ritual sequence give the piece a legible structure, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she completes this cycle and chooses to return again. However, escalation is mild and largely frictionless—once the setup is complete, the seven crossings occur without complication or reversal. The costs and mysteries of Thorne and her brother remain conceptual background rather than drivers of a decisive on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: radio static clears → opportunity to perform ritual properly → spilled-ink divination → realization about the defense system and their new purpose → quiet acceptance. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration of their existence, with a legible before/after in how they frame their “death certificate error.” The structure is linear and coherent, but the lack of complication or reversal within the ritual (it largely just works) diminishes a sense of cost or structural tension that elite markets tend to want.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure—decades of ritual culminating in one pattern of birds that finally unlocks the diamond—tracks cleanly and causality is straightforward. The closure (the first complete sentence emerging from the stone) lands clearly as a decisive change and conceptual repricing of the “curse.” However, much of the narrative is summarized habit and history rather than dramatized turning points, so escalation feels gently linear instead of sharply tightening. Cost at the end is mostly implied (a life spent, language mostly gone) rather than concretely tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: Aris observes, reflects, and gradually reorients their mission rather than moving through discrete plot turns. Causality is coherent (eclipse → transformations → arrowhead → research pivot), and the time jump to “by the end of their third month” is clean. Closure comes as a conceptual repricing—Aris embracing witnessing over exposure—yet the cost (what they forgo or risk) is only lightly sketched. Structural solidity is there, but the lack of a concrete, pressured turn keeps it from feeling narratively decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—locust shell → orchard → sapling → changed world—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clear before/after reconfiguration. The orchard sequence fulfills closure requirements: Elayn makes a concrete choice, secures the sapling, and this act explicitly triggers world change. However, many key beats, especially the societal transformation, are summarized in a swift epilogue rather than dramatized, softening impact. The drive lens (essentially causal with some lyric accumulation) stays consistent, and orientation is solid from early on.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: risky object → checkpoint → timed mail drop → guard entrance → successful handoff → reflective walk and future plans. The drive lens reads primarily causal with some accumulative resonance through the recurring weather/border motifs, and closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: his work is reweighted as part of a “quiet war” with tangible wins. Cost is implied (danger of smuggling under occupation) rather than dramatized at a knife’s edge, and the guard encounter resolves a bit too smoothly to feel maximally tested. Still, the structure is coherent, oriented from the outset, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the fragment leads to the impossible door, to the oasis, to the urge to sing, to the carousel’s rebirth, landing in a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. The single-scene structure with one temporal/physical shift into the oasis is easy to follow, and the backstory is economically anchored to present cues. Closure is on-page and legible, with the price being the risk of breaking silence and re-entering relationship with the forgotten world. The main limitation is that the cost and constraint of this choice stay conceptual rather than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation → hyperbolic arrangement → activation → reawakening → aftermath, all in one continuous night scene. Causality is coherent and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where Margaret completes her mission and the library itself rearranges—is on the page with a conceptual cost (the scarf’s dissolution and her exhaustion). Pressure is mostly conceptual rather than situational, and there is no real risk of failure, which limits intensity. Still, for a lyric, accumulative piece, the arc is well-shaped and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: nocturnal library work → strange book appears → revised sunrise practice → alchemical studio work → revelation/map → conceptual revaluation of the sister’s fate. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens, with each step deepening understanding rather than introducing arbitrary turns. The sudden appearance of “The Language of Light and Longing” skews a bit toward convenient magical solution but is thematically aligned enough not to break plausibility. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Elara’s understanding of absence is reweighted—with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the nexus, ritual to enter, descent into the mind, unlocking, and return, all causally coherent. The closure—idea freed, Silas leaving at dawn with the ribbon—lands clearly as a completed mission with a before/after. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the narrative drive (freeing the trapped idea) is honored without cheats or late-breaking rules. It reads as a well-shaped single arc, immediately publishable structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: years of study → key-shaped constellation → alignment with fairy ring → visions of the theft → realization that memories are preserved → physical reclamation via touching mushrooms. This yields a solid Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, with a clear before/after in knowledge and identity. Structure is linear and coherent, but escalation is compressed; decades of work are summarized, while the actual unlocking and retrieval happen quickly and with little complication, softening the sense of earned difficulty. Still, closure lands cleanly and the drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal on a modest scale: we move from receiving a difficult shard → demonstration of the method → the shard-shadow interaction → Prisha’s test moment at the door → a quiet coda about exile’s purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his global drive (making exile meaningful via mentorship) is affirmed through Prisha’s changed behavior. The stakes are largely internal and pedagogical, which fits the piece, but the “reversible exile” promise never faces much pressure or a sharp on-page dilemma, keeping the arc gentler than it might be. Orientation and sequencing are clear, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, single-ritual structure is clear: receive heirloom → recall grandmother’s teaching → perform weaving → seed transformed → assume guardianship stance. Causality is intact and the closure unit (she completes the transformation and settles into an ongoing role) reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. However, the story lacks a meaningful on-page test or credible risk of failure; nothing complicates or endangers the ritual, so the before/after carries modest cost. Structurally competent and legible, but low-pressure for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear and linear: Jacob’s revelation about the net leads to Elena’s choice to unravel it, which grounds the spirits and enables him to speak his secret. Causality is intact and the single-scene frame under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens works. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: spirits calmed, Jacob unburdened, and Elena’s stance toward her gift subtly reweighted, though the felt cost is relatively mild. The story does not attempt ambitious structural risk, but what it does is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is coherent and easy to follow: vault → months of research → rainy Tuesday breakthrough → conceptual resolution. Causality works under an accumulative/textural lens—her methodical observation leads to pattern recognition, then to the realization about the constellation and chapel. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: maps become thresholds rather than conquerable records, with the cost that the henge won’t be physically “reopened.” The main weakness is that much of the action (decades of footage, surveillance history) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of lived progression.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the sunken library that moves from setup (object + assignment) to investigation to conceptual shift and closure. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative lens: repeated attention to the snow globe and transmission leads to the “home” reinterpretation and the final image of the vanished plane. Closure via conceptual repricing—death as frequency shift—is on the page and legible. The cost is more implied than dramatized, so the ending, while satisfying, doesn’t land with maximal structural force.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent, moving from discovery of the ghost to the establishment of their communication system and then to an ongoing harmony. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: the story layers concept and imagery rather than turning on concrete reversals. Closure exists—a settled relationship and continuing “silent song”—but the decisive change happens largely in summary, with little sense of hard-earned transition. Because stakes and obstacles are soft, the before/after line is conceptually clear but emotionally low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The elevator’s ten floors provide a clean structural spine and the causal chain is legible: discovery of the diary → repeated failed attempts → inspiration with goggles → decryption → decision to re-hide the secret. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to keep the secret and reframes her understanding of service and the captain. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural rather than high-causal pressure, but the pattern is consistent. Some beats in the middle feel repetitive (multiple reminders that the diary resists decryption) without adding new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: string breaks → stranded observation → recognition of the mentor’s fatal pattern → conceptual validation and recommitment. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the narrative steadily layers sky observations and memories toward the “conversation between cloud formations” that crystallizes her thesis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and it lands: her situation is still dangerous, but her understanding and sense of purpose have shifted. The cost remains largely implicit and conceptual, though—her physical predicament never tightens or complicates choices on the page, which keeps the structure from feeling fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear and contained: she comes to finish a sky-mapping mural, discovers the hidden compartment, finds the coin, and reconfigures her project in response. The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “portraiture” and “recording people” mean. Still, the demolition clock and her original goal exert limited structural pressure—her reorientation happens almost effortlessly, and there is little sense of what she cannot now do because of this choice. The final image has cadence but the cost of that repricing is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clear: Eli observes, investigates, decodes, and reaches a conceptual discovery, all within one coherent scene. The piece does land a closure beat via his realization about mapping luminous pathways. But the path to that realization is smooth and unchallenged; no setup thread seriously threatens not to pay off, and nothing forces a hard choice. Structure is sound but lacks tightening pressure that would make the final understanding feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecies → journey to the library → mirror maze → box → heart → restoration → library awakens, with a legible before/after. The global drive is essentially causal with a lyric overlay, and closure lands via the box’s opening and the activation of ancestral magic. Structural slips are minor: the mirror labyrinth resolves quickly and the prophecies/journal are mostly summarized, reducing on-page testing of his knowledge. Still, the piece feels coherent, self-contained, and properly closed for its scale.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: ghost notices failing orchards → chalk messages → Aris reexamines fields → discovery and use of the bell → recovery and long-term ritualization. Structure is essentially linear with a late-time zoom-out, and orientation is never in doubt. However, turns are smooth to the point of low friction: there are no real false starts, complications, or consequential failures, so the “collective effort” reads as largely untested. Closure lands conceptually (crisis averted, history reweighted) but with a relatively soft sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: climb → ritual attempt → clock’s resistance → integration of the lullaby → partial reset of the world’s doom. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure (the clock accepting the lullaby and the beam continuing) lands clearly with a sense of renewed but fragile stasis. Stakes are mostly conceptual/cosmic yet tied concretely to Elias’s action at the spindle. There are no major unkept set-ups or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of nut and blueprint → assembly of device → entry into labyrinth → rescue → internal repricing of his role. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear clock (night frost) and goal (save travelers). However, escalation is modest and the resolution is almost frictionless: the device works, the birds never truly test him, and there is little cost beyond the nut’s temporary depletion. Closure is present as a conceptual reconfiguration, but stakes never feel truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: argument → flight to ravine → observations → insight → phone call → reoriented work and relationship, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she reinterprets the chrysalis and commits to a new relational and professional stance. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. The main limitation is how little resistance the resolution faces—reconciliation and professional “integration” arrive quickly and without setbacks, slightly lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: we move from preparation and reflection through a small ritual climax (opening the door) to a conceptual repricing about where stories begin. Causality is clean (parole → shop → ritual → first customer), the world rules stay consistent, and closure lands with a clear before/after shift in understanding. The cost of parole and the restriction against harming completed stories are present but not sharply tested, so the sense of risk is more implied than felt. Still, as a quiet, single-scene lyric structure, it coheres and resolves effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dream-certainty → tidal pool reading → trek → revelation of stairs → descent → labor with the pool → emergence changed. The piece holds a single POV and scene progression without orientation issues, and the pavilion sequence functions as a clear central set-piece. Closure lands through a completed task and a shifted internal state (lighter heart) with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the middle lacks a strong turn or complication; the process feels inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the weight → idea for reimagined grain talks → multilingual meetings → community reconnection and symbolic closure. Structure is mostly summary with one lightly dramatized gathering, which flattens what should be pivotal beats into reportage. Closure is present and legible—the community’s relationship has changed and the clock weight is re-chained—but the key turns (conflict at meetings, resistance, risk) are elided. The drive lens reads as straightforwardly causal, but the lack of on-page friction limits its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean causal structure: modify device → activate interface → flood of memories → emerge changed. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they accept a permanently altered identity and purpose, with the “quaking reverie” now a constant state. Stakes and costs remain somewhat abstract—no concrete failure mode or specific risk is dramatized beyond identity blur. Still, the before/after is legible and the accumulative build to dawn works structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: decipher doodle → prepare threshold effects → enter grotto → solve combinations → awaken seeds → escape before gravity normalizes. The sixty-minute window and later “exactly seven minutes” offer structural tightening, and closure is clear in her successful activation of the defenses and return. However, key beats such as solving puzzles are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens both difficulty and consequence. The cost of failure or partial success remains abstract (“approaching darkness”) rather than concretely felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the grove → reading the cracks → emotional inundation → renewed resolve, all under a single, continuous scene. Causality holds and orientation is excellent, and the closure beat—her shifting from listening to carving with “renewed purpose”—lands as a subtle Resonant Reconfiguration. Still, stakes remain almost entirely conceptual and there’s no concrete obstacle or reversal, so the final turn feels more like completion of a ritual than a pressured change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine—exile → study of nexus → realization about the covenant → ritual act at the next phase—reads cleanly, with a legible before/after. The three-day clock and the impending “next phase” provide structure, even though we largely jump straight to day three. The closure unit is a conceptual repricing of exile and covenant, with Elias’s final act and realization happening on the page. The weakest link is the “suddenly, he understood” moment, which leans on summary more than dramatized causality from the silence/patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from preparation, through the frequency ritual, to the diary’s opening and conceptual twist. Causality under a primarily accumulative lens is solid—each added frequency/emotional layer builds toward the clasp’s response and the revelation that her work mirrors the diary’s contents. Closure functions as a conceptual reweighting (her project was already articulated; now it becomes a calling to teach), but the cost of that revelation is only lightly implied (lost years, redirected purpose) rather than dramatized. Orientation is crisp from the outset, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: seed introduction → nurturing/observation → vigil/reveal → redefinition of Elara’s role, with solid orientation throughout. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural, as scents, doodles, and heritage build toward the conceptual shift that the “corpse flower” is a guardian library. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—Elara’s role and the seed’s nature are reweighted—but the cost is soft and mostly implied. Time jumps (“Days blurred”) skim past potential turning points rather than dramatizing them, keeping the arc gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Hour of Inversion begins → he navigates via rivers → reaches the First Arch → echoes reveal the origin of resilience. Structure is a single continuous scene with a clear build toward the “gathering of echoes” and a return home, and orientation is strong throughout. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—he reinterprets the arrow tip and resilience—but the resolution is almost entirely delivered by exposition from the echoes, with little on-page resistance or cost. The mission feels completed too easily for the scale of the stakes claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and clear: arrival, survey, pattern recognition, preliminary conclusion, resolve to continue. Causality holds at a basic level (she sets sensors, gets data, draws inferences), but the escalation is mild and feels like extended setup for a story rather than a full arc. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—she commits to further investigation—but the before/after difference is conceptually small and low-cost. No major option is foreclosed or reweighted enough to feel like a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: one ritual performance that builds to the promised “sculpted hush,” and orientation is solid from the opening. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression from first bell to final chord and hush functions as a coherent arc, and the closure image lands on the page. However, causality is mostly linear and foregone—nothing threatens failure, and no decision alters the scene’s options. The cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatized, which limits impact at a demanding-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival in the range → construction of the pattern → music-enabled visions → reframed understanding → renewed purpose. The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive well, with each phase of the ritual deepening his grasp of the failure and narrowing him toward acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he returns the driftwood, reclaims the flute with a new meaning, and leaves with a different stance at visible emotional cost. There are no major structural slips, and the single continuous scene suits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Elara needs data, summons Thomas, conducts the empathy transfer, and returns to her research with new information. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—she has crossed another ethical line and calmly doubles down on her worldview. Still, the sense of cost is muted: Thomas staggers and flees, but the story does not dramatize enduring consequences or a genuine risk to Elara’s project. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative with light causality, and that pattern holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine—journey along the ridgeway, encounter, shortcut, delivery, relinquishing the pendant—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in Ayla’s role. Closure lands cleanly when she passes the pendant to the elder and redefines her mission, an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change blend with a legible cost (loss of the artifact, new identity). However, the middle lacks meaningful complications or reversals; the journey unfolds almost frictionlessly, with much of the tension told in retrospect (“saved her more times than she could count”). Some of the future-legend summary distances us from present-moment pressure, softening structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is straightforward causal: she sets up an experiment, executes it, receives more-than-expected data, and reframes her life’s work. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of her theory. However, the outcome never seriously seems in doubt and the experiment’s success feels somewhat preordained, softening structural tension. The cost of the new knowledge is gestured at but not materially tested within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent and legible: silence deepens → bead activates → journey through the forest → discovery of puzzle pieces → sacrificial traversal → activation of the ancient bamboo → restoration of sound. The single-POV quest structure suits a short, mythic narrative, and temporal compression (“Time blurred strangely...”) reads as an intentional fantasy effect rather than a cheat. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive change and conceptual repricing: Elara restores sound at visible cost. A slightly more dramatized struggle at each sacrifice could have intensified the sense of narrowing options and elevated the structure further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → bargain → new ability → repairing tools → saving the arches → new social role, and orientation is never in doubt. Structure is essentially linear with a mild time jump into montage; this works but stays safe. The piece promises a meaningful barter (“magician’s silk never gave freely”) yet never specifies or dramatizes the price, so the closure image lacks the paid cost the setup demands. As a result, we get a satisfying conceptual before/after but a somewhat undercut sense of true consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative mosaic: repeated jumps, enlarging glimpses of alternate timelines, then a charged but quiet return. Causality is soft but coherent; the shard enables travel, which leads to deeper mystery and the dream-door. Closure is a modest Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: power spent, door withheld, commitment reaffirmed. The lack of a sharper turn or concrete consequence at the door keeps this from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: lamp failure → troubleshooting → discovery of sea glass and loose board → letters and stone code → emotional reorientation → repaired lamp and ritualized participation. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early and never in doubt, and the story sustains a single continuous scene with one clear through-line. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with a new understanding of his role and connection across time, with costs implied in his long solitude and his vow of protection. The main structural limitation is that the external problem (lamp outage) resolves almost offhandedly, so plot-level stakes never fully tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is coherent: she discovers her accidental prophecy, worries about it, then guides a refugee fleet through a hidden channel that confirms her role. Structure is essentially linear with light reflection/backstory interwoven; orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the opening and the drive lens reads as Hybrid (situational pressure plus accumulative mood). Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment—she recommits to guiding humanity home—but the “before/after” feels modest, as there is no new constraint or consequence that visibly reconfigures her options. The prophetic element is introduced and then largely set aside as potential rather than structurally tested, which softens the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: daily observation → experiments with dyes and light → discovery of a special mixture → conceptual realization about narrative magnetism. Causality is gentle but present (tracking sun → specialized dyes → morpho-dust mixture → “magnetic” stories), and the closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of what makes stories endure. There is no strong plot-level reversal or external crisis, but for a lyric-essayistic structure, the progression is legible and satisfying. The future-oriented ending with guests and the donor heart’s legacy closes the loop without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating toward the sextant’s flare and Samuel’s repricing of sorrow, with clear anchors of who/where/when and no causality breaks. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, with the storm, mapping, and resonance frequency building toward the singular moment when the pin’s chime aligns with the dream fragment. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing (sorrow as resilience), but escalation is gentle and the decisive change requires relatively little on-page cost or choice. The magical payoff is somewhat coincidental (ping + moonlight) rather than fully driven by tactical action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: we move from watching through the window to entering the orchard, weaving dawn via song, and culminating in the realm’s awakening and the keeper’s rest. Causality is intact—song and tending lead to brightening plants, to woven dawn, to restored connections. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: the realm shifts from endless night to possibility, and duty resolves into rest. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: discovery of the invitation, contemplation, decision, note, and quiet return to work. The drive lens reads as situational/accumulative, with the mounting social pressure of the pending gathering and her internal response leading to an Earned Stasis closure. Escalation is modest; clock chimes and distant murmurs hint at tightening, but little in-scene happens to truly corner her. Closure is on-page and legible, but the stakes feel small and the path to the endpoint relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent and linear: exploration → tea house scene → reflection on letters → revelation of the bakers’ motive → internal shift and coda. Closure is present via a conceptual repricing of the bakery’s disappearance and Eliza’s guilt, but the key revelation is summarized from the letter rather than dramatized as a pressured discovery. Under an accumulative lens the progression works, yet the climax hinges on a somewhat mechanical “explain-everything” letter rather than a more active turn.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: set-up of duty and tool, the act of measurement, revelation of partial resilience, then a decision to attempt preservation. Causality is coherent—because the vows are fading, he measures; because he measures, he discovers a reinforcement method. Closure is present in a modest Conceptual Repricing: the situation of inevitable loss is reweighted to conditional, hard-won preservation. The main weakness is the low felt cost at closure; nothing significant is lost or foreclosed on the page as the new plan emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Eliza seeds suspicion, escalates to Malachi, triggers the note, and engineers the moment of betrayal that lets the watch fob “record” the silence. The story maintains a single continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal orientation. Closure is solid: once the silence is captured and the truce breaks, Eliza’s goal is achieved and she exits, with a clear before/after in the market’s trust network. The cost is more conceptual and external than personal, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene arc: ring activates → convergence → confrontation with the storm carrier → acceptance and transformation. Causality is legible and the closure (becoming a carrier) is on-page and coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens. However, several ideas (forest elections, global carriers, ecological stakes) are introduced and resolved mostly through explanation rather than dramatized turns, which softens structural impact. The cost of the final change is more thematic than narratively pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine (cleaner finds portrait → memory returns → Rhodes goes to cave → retrieves/finishes painting → internal reconfiguration) is clean and legible. Structure is essentially one continuous present scene with compact but clear flashback, and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses to paint for himself, with felt cost in the years of suppression and the risk of disregarding critics. A touch more on-page resistance or complication in the cave would heighten the sense of earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is linear and coherent: artifact → legend → discovery of map → realization about key/lock → decision to depart. The causal chain is clean but low-intensity, with most turns reported in retrospect (“yesterday, while repairing…”) rather than dramatized as live beats. Closure lands as a clear stance crystallization—she will pursue the Repository through honesty—but the cost is mostly projected rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: established role → discovery of fragment → creation of sculpture → societal transformation → aging and death → charged final image. The structure is essentially mythic biography, which suits the accumulative/textural lens and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end with her passing and legacy. Closure lands: the world is reconfigured around silent, light-based symphonies, and her death is a meaningful endpoint. What’s missing for higher scores is any significant structural complication or turn that materially alters options midstream; events progress smoothly without much structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic shift → dome/system failure → protocol 34/miniaturization → successful but costly transformation, with closure landing decisively on the page. The drive lens reads primarily causal, with the situational pressure of the geomagnetic event forcing a single, clear response. The cost—Unit 734’s original form going inert and consciousness fracturing—is legible and tied to prior setup (box of fears, inner dissonance). Some middle beats (e.g., prior shifts, mechanics of miniaturization) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly flattening the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → curiosity → neighborhood stories → key → mailbox → letters → window display, with a legible before/after conceptual shift. Structure is mostly summary-bridged vignettes rather than scenes, but the pattern is coherent and supports an accumulative/textural drive. The key’s late introduction via Mrs. Henderson feels convenient yet not outright implausible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “ownership” and community memory, but with little felt cost or hard choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: decoding journals → ritual with dice and dance → awakening Lydia → post-climax summary. Closure exists via a decisive change (system awakening and world “renaissance”), but the turn lands without meaningful on-page cost or complication. Structurally, the piece shifts from scene into summary at the end, which flattens the climax’s impact. The drive lens reads primarily causal with light lyric accumulation, and it holds, but the arc feels too easy for the stakes claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: whale beaches → anomalies intensify → chamber readings and coffee ritual → indicated site → digging → crystal discovery → conceptual and emotional resolution. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the story maintains a single, coherent drive toward the memory question. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: she redefines “deletion” as transformation and accepts visiting rather than reclaiming, with a marked before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that the path feels a bit frictionless—she moves from plan to success without any significant structural complication or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrive in haven → prepare ritual → interface with prophecy → contain and release it, yielding a clean causal arc. Closure is present and legible—the prophecy is hushed, the crane departs, balance is restored—but the cost of success never quite crystallizes beyond a mild expenditure of effort. The middle acts mostly as a steady descriptive plateau rather than a tightening progression of tactics or constraints. The accumulative pattern is coherent, but the lack of a true pinch point or complication keeps it in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Clara’s curiosity → sugar borrowing → weekly teas → the seal → the rooftop revelation → inheritance and transfer of the seal. Structure is mostly linear summary with a clear hinge at the meteor-shower scene, and closure is present in the conceptual shift from “mystery” to “shared heritage.” The cost—living under agreed-upon lies, accepting a hidden role—is gestured at rather than dramatized, so the ending feels resolved but relatively low-pressure. Still, the before/after is legible and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: Elara comes to the garden to use the resonance structures, activates them, accesses the quarantined memories, learns the truth about her father, and accepts the archivist role. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored very early, and the single-scene structure is coherent. Closure is solid: there is a decisive reconfiguration of her role and self-conception with some felt cost in bearing dangerous knowledge. The main structural weakness is that the process feels relatively unopposed; success arrives without serious setbacks or complicating turns.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: key arrives → reveals hidden decree → he drafts an addendum → blood signature triggers the key’s dissolution and symbolic absolution → he leaves. Closure is decisive and on-page: he reverses his treasonous act and chooses to re-enter the world, with the cost of public confession and potential consequences implicitly clear. Structure is linear and coherent within a single scene and brief aftermath, with no orientation issues. The magical mechanics of the key are somewhat convenient but don’t undercut causality or the earned nature of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: she learns of a destabilizing echo, seeks it, investigates, then intervenes and reaches closure with a clear before/after in her understanding and purpose. Causality is straightforward and coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the final decision by the child’s echo provides on-page closure and cost reconfiguration. However, many beats are summarized (“Through progressive disclosure… she began to understand…”) instead of dramatized, especially the investigation and the child’s decision. The lack of concrete obstacles or reversals keeps the arc from feeling fully tested or taut.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: dive → retrieval of the globe → amplified dream-contact → uncovering sabotage → gentle exposure → captain’s release. However, large swaths of the most pivotal material (“night after night,” descendants coming forward) are summarized rather than scened, which blunts the felt turns. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—the truth changes how the wreck is understood and frees the captain—but the cost of that truth is mostly conceptual, not dramatized. The piece reads more like an outline of a novella’s plot arc than a fully pressured short story structure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: a day’s ritual, the journey to the parapet, and the closing tea ceremony build toward a quiet conceptual closure. Causality is modest but clean (whistle → moon paths → parapet → contemplative return → dawn work), and the before/after lies in the deepened articulation of his philosophy. The closure has cost chiefly in implication (his chosen solitude and unnoticed wisdom) rather than in an on-page turn with visible consequence. This works structurally but lacks a sharper decisive change or felt price that would push it higher for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: arrival at the orchard → discovery of the box → reconstruction of the letters → understanding the stillpoint → decision to guard and weaponize the truth for resistance. Closure is present via her shift from debunker to protector/organizer, and the stakes are legible. However, much of the middle is summarized (“for days, she worked...”), so key beats (the investigation itself and any obstacles) feel compressed and under-dramatized, muting structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: exile → decoding storms → appearance of parallel prophet → acceptance of translator role. Orientation is strong and the throughline (receiving and interpreting signals) is easy to follow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias watching the prophet’s rise from his observatory, aware of his indirect authorship—though the cost of that stance is more implied than sharply felt. The piece remains largely expository, with few concrete turns where options narrow or tactics must change.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is clean and causal: discovery of the music box → recognition of its potential → crafted jar → senior center payoff, with a legible before/after in the room’s atmosphere. The dominant drive is a light causal arc supported by accumulative texture; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the music shifts the intergenerational dynamic. However, the middle (his “method of capturing” and “by midday” arrival) slides into summarized process instead of pressured beats, so the turn from insight to communal transformation feels frictionless. Cost at closure is minimal: success arrives without meaningful resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: broadcast → intruders’ arrival → descent to the chamber → ritual to repel them, with the artifact’s safety and town’s protection as the throughline. The drive lens is clearly causal, and closure is a Decisive Change: protection renewed, intruders driven off, Elias recommitting to guardianship. The main weakness is cost and resistance—the intruders remain offstage and are dispatched by a single overwhelming sonic move, so escalation feels a bit under-contested. Structure is otherwise tight, single-scene, and temporally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent: night of observation → awaited full-moon moment → confirmation → dawn resolve. The inferred drive lens is largely Accumulative/Textural; detail and reflection build toward the viaduct’s hum as confirmation of theory, which functions as mild closure (RR/CR) rather than a decisive change. Causal linkage is thin—the sign arrives exactly as predicted and nothing really shifts the mapper’s options or forces a hard choice. Closure exists but the before/after line is more conceptual than dramatically felt, with minimal sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain—missing worker → body in tunnel → lantern → hidden note → corruption implications → Maya’s decision—is clean and easy to follow, and the scene stays in one continuous window. Closure lands via a clear Decisive Change: she chooses to submit findings despite risk, with the investigation widening from individual accident to systemic negligence. Some turns (e.g., the note conveniently containing both historical escape info and up-to-date maintenance rot details) feel slightly contrived, softening the sense of hard-won discovery. Still, the drive lens remains coherent and the before/after in her stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: he seeks the repair, weighs cost and meaning, then decisively chooses not to fix the heart after reframing it via the inmate’s apology and the house for the ex-wife. Backstory is smoothly anchored in present stimuli and leads directly to his final decision, giving the piece a coherent arc. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he forecloses the path of repair, accepting the heart’s silence as his ongoing burden. The structure is straightforward and solid, though escalation remains relatively gentle and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clean: arrow tip → kaleidoscope decoding → hidden chamber → bell → ring. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a legible before/after at the moment the bell sounds (closure as a small Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration). However, obstacles are essentially absent—no meaningful resistance, failed attempts, or narrowed options. As a result, the ending feels more like a completion of a task than a pressured climax with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: noticing anomalous absences → decoding the 731 pattern → breaching restricted sectors → uncovering the Stellaris truth → fleeing with evidence. Closure functions as a clear Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: she downloads what she can under alarms and disappears into the underground, with the case and conspiracy reconfigured. That said, several key beats are summarized rather than dramatized (e.g., the hacking window, the security response), which blunts the sense of mounting jeopardy. The structure is clean but feels more like an outline of a thriller scene than a fully realized one at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clear: elders’ challenge → need to fix the crystal → mirrors show fragments → orchard ritual reconstitutes it, with a legible before/after. The piece achieves closure via the restored crystal and Elena’s implicit answer to the elders, but the storm and the elders remain entirely offstage, keeping the stakes conceptual. Structure is linear and coherent; the mirror backstory is smoothly integrated and anchored. The lack of reversals or genuine doubt during the ritual keeps the arc from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative structure: marina work and conversations with Marcus build toward a reconfiguration where Elena reframes death-seeking as transformation and chooses to remain. Causality is soft but present—her exposure to natural timelines, the “fold in patience,” and the ice’s behavior all motivate the ending. Closure is clean (she forecloses euthanasia and commits to staying), though the path is largely expository and low on concrete turning points or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: one quiet night frame with repeated returns to the pavilion, the bus, and reflection. Orientation is clean, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of his solitude into vocation—is legible. However, the middle is largely a list of similar realizations and retrospective summaries, so causal or even pattern-based tightening is weak. The before/after shift is more declared than built by distinct turns, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: prophet arrival → temple murmurs → ritual of consecration → echo preserved, with a clean before/after reconfiguration. Closure is on-page (the clearing endures; the echo is stored with a cost) and the drive lens remains stable. Causality is soft but legible; the parapet and pavilion respond in understandable sequence to the ritual. The main limitation is that pressure never tightens very far, so the structural arc feels more like a beautifully rendered plateau than a climb.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: arrival, preparation, group ritual, and a quiet closing image. The inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration in the final circle and “another piece of the great puzzle” line. However, there is no meaningful turn or complication—everything unfolds as planned without resistance—so the before/after is more a gentle affirmation than a pressured change with cost. Backstory about how she discovered the arcs is smoothly integrated but does not significantly alter present options.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-moment interaction with the crystal is interwoven with reflection that progressively reframes his work, culminating in the revelation that he is translating rather than preserving. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens—the humming → discovery of echoes → deliberate use of the crystal → final pure tone and realization. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing (what dictionaries and preservation mean “after the last dictionary was printed”), but the cost is more implied than felt. Still, the scene carries a clear before/after in how he understands his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: desire → use of driftwood to navigate fog → discovery of arch → chalk drawings → activation of the sound, with the caretaker’s revelation knitting the grandmother’s art into this quest. The piece reads primarily under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where he finally encounters, then is poised to lose, the sound he’s chased—lands clearly. Cost is perceptible in the fleeting nature of the experience and his solitude at the end. The structure is straightforward and linear, with no major orientation or logic slips, but the coincidence of the caretaker’s knowledge feels a bit convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is legible: shaking → clock anomaly → days of attempts → outdoor experiment → realization → restructured perception filters → resolution. Closure is a clean resonant reconfiguration where the observatory’s understanding of reality shifts, and the end-image pays off the setup. The main weakness is that the “days” of attempts and the solution are somewhat summarized, softening immediacy and cost of the process. Stakes are conceptually high, but structurally the conflict never feels close to genuine failure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: test results → decision to stage a final musical goodbye → family arrival and ritual → death and quiet aftermath. The story follows one continuous scene with no orientation issues and delivers closure through Mr. Anders’ passing and the charged final image of the son holding the vinyl. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the ending reweights “reunification” and “space between notes” effectively. The only limit is that the structural turn from set-up to peak is very smooth, almost too gentle for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara prepares the ritual, uses the key, closes the loops, and the resulting revelation/doorway answers the central question, giving solid closure via conceptual repricing. The single-scene structure is coherent, with no orientation issues and clear because/therefore linkages. The main weakness is that the ritual unfolds without a hitch—no failed attempt, complication, or real risk—so cost at closure is largely implied (future danger, responsibility) rather than dramatized. Still, the before/after shift in knowledge and possibility is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine—substitute body and tooth → hedge maze → secret garden ritual → Arthur’s emergence → softening of boundaries—is clean and legible. The piece uses a mostly causal drive with a strong accumulative, atmospheric build, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Eleanor steps into a new stance where mystery and forgiveness eclipse certainty. However, the cost of that closure (what she relinquishes or risks) is conceptually implied rather than concretely dramatized. Structure is sound and well-contained, but the final turn feels more granted than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent: collecting sea glass → experimenting with polishing and light → creating “star maps” → grotto becoming a pilgrimage site → internal reframing at the end. Causality is straightforward and legible, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she revalues her constraint as vantage and purpose. However, many key moves—discovery of the projection effect, the arrival of visitors—are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page turning points and visible cost. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds through closure, but the escalation remains low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-time wandering, reflection anchored in setting, and a ritual act that leads to a resonant coda months later. Causality is soft but coherent: noticing the icicle spiral → mapping grief → following it to the offering point → release of guilt signaled by the hush and future moss image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with a clear before/after in her relationship to the confession and pendant. Stakes are modestly scaled but legible and not undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece works on an accumulative/lyric lens: one continuous scene at the nexus, thick with reflection, building toward a conceptual reconfiguration (broken/complete, peace with his calling). Closure is present—placing the shell and reading the last paragraph crystallizes his shift—but the cost of that shift (what he materially gives up or risks) remains largely in summarized backstory. There is little structural tightening in the present; the middle paragraphs reiterate rather than reconfigure pressure. Overall, it’s coherent and gently shaped, but not sharply contoured.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: strange vine → visions → decision to restore songs before the harvest moon → research and invention → communal ritual that succeeds. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative feel, and closure lands clearly when the villagers remember and the vine returns to a natural state. However, stakes are never seriously imperiled—her plan unfolds without significant setback or alternative path, so cost at closure is more implied effort than felt sacrifice. Structurally it’s solid and publishable, but the lack of a pressured inflection point keeps it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: preparation of the pattern → application of flash-paper → orchard transformed by captured starlight. The accumulative/lyric drive lens is consistent, and closure lands with a clear before/after (withered vs re-illumined orchard, threatened vs renewed hope). However, the ritual faces no real complication or setback; the threatened cost (“one misstep… and the starlight would dissipate”) never manifests in tactics or reversal. As a result, the ending feels somewhat preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure—observation → mapping → reconstruction → reactivation—lands cleanly, with a clear before/after at the moment the timer awakens. Causality is coherent throughout, and the “wounded season” frame gives a mild temporal arc. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the function of the timer and Elara’s work are reweighted in the final image. The main limitation is that no beat feels truly in doubt; the line from setup to success is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a ritual sequence of burden-collections building toward the ancient civilization burden and the conceptual turn at the end. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong from early on (who, where, when, what they’re doing). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the same “boundary-lessly trapped” state is revalued as connection, with others’ unnamed relief as cost/benefit. The main limitation is the relatively low sense of jeopardy or narrowing options within the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the kettle’s boil window frames one ritual of grief, escalating from intention to carving to placement on the mantel and a reweighted gaze at the rain. Causality is simple but coherent—each step follows from the last, and the closure (her decision to keep living this way) registers as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the “crystallized time” conceit holds consistently. The only limitation is that the structural turn is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping this just below elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: lagoon after the halt → scavenging → finding the wheel → preparing the harness → activating images/bridge → confronting the ghost → carousel resumes and time realigns. Closure is solid, with a clear before/after in both the world (stillness vs turning) and Cyrus’s state (unresolved regret vs integrated self), and the cost is implied in the relinquishing of the wheel and his prior lost years. Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation problems, though the negotiation itself resolves quickly and without a strong on-page price or complication. The drive lens reads primarily causal with some accumulative lyric texture, and that lens holds through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and clean: she stays → explores → finds sextant → goes to power center → reroutes → restores partial power → reads inscriptions and reframes the place. Closure is a conceptual repricing where the terminal becomes a metaphorical navigational tool for hope, and this is legible on the page. However, the plot lacks complicating turns or meaningful obstacles; everything unfolds in a smooth, nearly outline-like progression with minimal felt risk or constraint. The cost at closure is mostly implied scale (her future work) rather than something paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single pilgrimage-like scene that proceeds logically from arrival, to ritual, to realization, to decision. The accumulative/textural lens fits: the intensifying crystal song and bear’s presence build toward the offering of the watch and the decision to resume work. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in his stance toward his dream with a visible emotional cost in the decades of abandonment. What’s missing at a higher level is sharper on-page constraint or complication; the line of action is almost frictionless once the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: she arrives, searches, discovers the journal, reads, and reinterprets her tools and mission, landing in a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is straightforward with no orientation issues, but the beat sequence is low-pressure and largely accumulative rather than driven by consequential choices or complications. The grandfather’s disappearance and the city’s lies are powerful set-ups, yet they remain offstage, so the sense of cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatically felt. The closure is legible and coherent but not yet truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    Structure is clean: a single scene that moves from approach → observation → recognition → partial initiation, with a clear before/after (ignorant vs initiated into the knots’ language). Causality holds—his patience and the fulgurite prompt the fisherman to share—but the progression feels linear and low-friction, with no real risk of failure. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: he leaves with the rope and new knowledge, but the cost of this gain is almost entirely abstract. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and is consistent, yet the final turn doesn’t quite tighten stakes so much as gently affirm them.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: present-moment writing in the garden interwoven with brief, anchored backstory about the palace and his profession. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure—a decision to write his own obituary and reframe the thread as compass—is on the page with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never drifts. Escalation is modest but the before/after is legible and resonant for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and causal: prince decides to assemble the device, activates it, glimpses transformation, then faces the collapse and a revised understanding. Orientation is solid from the first lines (who/where/what he wants), and the global drive remains focused on this single experiment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the attempt fails materially but redefines his path and the terms of the problem. The arc is straightforward and lacks surprises, but it is well-shaped for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clear and linear: survey → threat → protection of the garden → quiet aftermath, with backstory cleanly anchored to present sensory cues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward legacy and scars crystallizes in the dawn-and-lagoon images, with a clear before/after in her relationship to her father’s gifts. However, causal pressure is mild—the fire arrives, she executes her plan, and the garden holds without a serious complication or cost. The ending feels thematically complete but narratively low in bite, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: Elara follows breadcrumbs → reaches empty pedestal → invokes constellations → sees star-key → finds box → imagines memories free → box dissolves → city revives. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure unit (city’s fountains reawaken and Elara’s role shifts). However, escalations occur smoothly with little resistance; each new magical aid (breadcrumbs, starlight, window-box) appears just when needed and works on the first try. The cost of releasing “dangerous” memories remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is cleanly circular: departure from the nebula garden, mission to a civilization, successful delivery of light, and return. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of transit and recording builds a sense of ongoing cosmic labor, and the ending offers a mild resonant reconfiguration (hope that generational patterns might break). However, there’s little on-page complication or narrowing of options; the mission proceeds without obstacles, and cost at closure remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Causality is coherent but the arc feels more like a vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: craft → ritual → retracing → vision → monument → communal viewing, with a clear before/after in his role and understanding. Causality is soft but legible—retracing the mentor’s path with the ribbon/butterflies leads to the idea of the collective-grief monument. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: grief refigured from individual to collective, with the depleted ribbon and mentor’s completion as quiet costs. The piece lacks any major structural surprise, but for a lyric accumulative design it holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: broken handle → inscriptions → realization of neglected community → call for help → collective repair → reweighted final image. Closure is solidly on the page as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: Alaric’s role and the town’s relationship to time are both redefined with visible vulnerability cost. The structure is straightforward and linear, with no orientation issues, but some moves (especially the highly didactic inscriptions) feel conveniently tailored to deliver the theme rather than arising organically from prior specifics. Stakes never seriously threaten failure once he asks for help, so the climax reads more inevitable than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: clock hits zero → case hums → tapestry is decoded → unexpected sacrificial intention is revealed → Elias chooses to preserve the secret and reset the clock. The piece functions under a primarily causal lens with an accumulative, reflective texture; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of what these “echoes” mean to him. The stakes and cost of the realization are modest and largely conceptual, which keeps the structural turn from feeling truly momentous. Still, the scene holds together smoothly in time and space with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene atop the spire, framed as the charged pause before beginning the map and the completion of that map at the end. Causality is coherent but low-intensity; everything important (models, prior successes, upcoming melt) has already happened or will happen off-page, leaving the present action mostly contemplative. Closure qualifies as a modest Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she commits in full to her role and finishes the map that will shape the village’s future. The cost of this choice (ongoing burden, responsibility, risk of failure) is implied but not dramatized in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clear: present-tense broadcast frame, then an explanatory expansion about the story famine and dust technology, ending in a quiet reaffirmation of her ongoing work. Causality is sound under an accumulative lens—past famine → censorship → dust method → tonight’s broadcast. However, tonight’s actions don’t markedly alter her situation or options; this reads as “one night among many,” so closure is more atmospheric than decisively transformative. The conceptual repricing (dust as quiet revolution) lands, but with modest on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece functions on an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene, anchored by the slowing rocking chair and the progression of working on the mask. Closure lands conceptually when Elena reframes safety as being in the process of becoming, tied to the chair’s final cessation. However, the structural turns are gentle; there is little sense of options narrowing or consequences shifting beyond reflection, so the before/after divide, while present, is not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and clear: discovery of cog → reflection on its meaning vs Council doctrine → decision to preserve and continue his work. As a situational/accumulative piece, it achieves a mild closure via his reaffirmed choice, but the stakes and options don’t truly shift; we end in almost the same place we began, just slightly reasserted. There’s no significant tightening beat where new information narrows his options or raises the immediate cost. The closure works conceptually but feels underpowered for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent as a life-spanning, accumulative vignette that moves from autumn to spring to “years later” and concludes with the baton/rosette handoff. Causality is broadly logical—Eleanor teaches, builds the choir, then passes on her legacy—but the beats are mostly expository rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of real turns or narrowing options. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her stance reframes from resignation toward active hope with the symbolic transfer of the rosette. The cost of her life’s work (what she has given up, what remains at risk) is gestured at rather than made concretely legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: greenhouse → celestial alignment → planting the seed → reflective close, with a clear before/after once the seed is in the soil. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causal chain is thin, with the alignment functioning more as a permission slip than a pressure that truly narrows options. Backstory and exposition (e.g., the lineage of chefs, synaptic plasticity) are inserted cleanly but don’t generate additional turns. The ending’s claim that the city’s relationship with food will be transformed is aspirational rather than earned by on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → tower access restriction → Bureau visit with riddle → discovery of damaged panel → confrontation with supervisor. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one continuous ascent providing a clear spine and a legible before/after once the supervisor’s motives are revealed. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blackout is reinterpreted from “sabotage” to “despair,” and Elara’s honesty acquires a bridging function. Still, major turns resolve quickly and without much resistance, making the climactic confrontation feel somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: the shard’s discovery, three days of experimentation, and the lighthouse scene build toward a single realization, then a quiet walk-out. Causality is clear—finding the shard leads to testing it, which leads to the glowing triad and her insight about houses and love. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she now understands the rule behind “alive” houses, and her future path (“continue to notice these creeping normalities”) is reconfigured. The main limitation is that the change, while legible, carries minimal on-page cost or lost option.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: revelation has already occurred, the diver returns, receives the ampoule, experiences the city’s memories, and leaves with a reconfigured understanding—an accumulative drive with a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. Causality is intact, with each step logically following from the last, and the closure (the diver returning with better questions) is legible and thematically aligned. The cost, however, remains largely conceptual—the loss of certainty—and is stated more than dramatized, softening the impact of the before/after divide. Still, the scene moves smoothly toward a coherent closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: missed bet → purgatorial staircase → years of proofs → exploit flaw with chipped die → rupture and reset to bar → decisive bet. The structure—a long compressed middle of accumulated effort and a sharp rupture into the bar—is legible and closure lands clearly with a before/after shift. Cost (years of “boundless confinement”) is conceptually strong but mostly summarized, not dramatized through escalating on-page turns. Still, under a Causal lens, the ending feels properly earned and the global drive holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: ascent to the greenhouse, preparation, painting, and a quiet dawn closure. Causality is simple but intact, with each step (moonlight, daydreams, symbols) naturally feeding the mural’s creation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she feels certain of humanity’s kindness before any external validation, which draws a clear before/after in her internal state. However, the arc lacks a meaningful on-page complication or reversal, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: beekeeper’s absence → cultural erosion → guide’s attempt with lens → bread ritual → metaphysical thaw. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city shifts from passive decay to a charged poise of tentative renewal, with dread explicitly persisting. Still, the solution appears rapidly once the lens is repurposed, with minimal friction or failed attempts, softening the sense of cost. Structure—a single, continuous scene—holds together cleanly without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: low tide reveals the stone, Esme applies her specialized skill to the yoyo, initiates the mechanism, and the world reconfigures. Orientation is solid from the first lines (Esme, rocky shore, lighthouse, low tide), and the piece holds a causal drive lens through to closure. Closure is on-page via a decisive change—the unlocking of latent radiance and a conceptual shift in how the world runs—but the cost of that shift remains conceptual rather than concretely dramatized. The lack of setbacks or complicating turns keeps the structure from feeling truly hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: resuscitation → entry to funhouse → paradox-reading → mirror/future-self reveal → revaluation of death → exit at dawn. The closure unit (Conceptual Repricing of death and the curse) lands cleanly with the funhouse dissolving and the clasp dispersing into light. Still, beats often feel pre-ordained by authorial intent, with little genuine uncertainty about whether the narrator might refuse or fail. Structural solidity is present, but the arc lacks a sharper hinge decision or more tangible cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: blue hour setup, storm threat, musical intervention, and a calm resolution where the community continues on. Causality is intact—her playing appears to divert the storm—and the piece lands in a clear, quiet Resonant Reconfiguration where her purpose is affirmed. However, escalation is modest and there’s minimal sense of options narrowing or failure risk; the outcome feels assured once the pattern is established. The closure works, but at low intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Orientation is crisp: we understand the turtle-city, Kael’s role, the gate, the watchers, and the immediate situation within the opening. The causal chain is straightforward and coherent—whistle → shell response → hidden chamber → artifacts → revelation → new stance—supporting a clean Causal lens. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: Kael reinterprets the watchers and his purpose, and the final image crystallizes this with the whistle and turtle’s turn. The main weakness is that the central revelation is delivered in a dense expository block summarizing the expedition’s discoveries instead of staging any part of that discovery, which flattens what could be a more charged structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: the letter leads to the station, to architectural parallels, to carved initials, to the hidden ledger, creating a clear because/therefore chain. The closure—Eleanor finding the ledger and deciding to take it as proof—lands as a decisive change in knowledge with conceptual cost. The piece does rely heavily on exposition rather than dramatized beats, but causality and orientation remain solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival, survey, discovery, retrieval of the box, cataloging, and renewed commitment. Causality is intact—finding the object leads to diving, which leads to the memory cubes and his new note—and orientation is clear throughout. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to returning and listening, with the inkwell click as a cadence. However, the decisive change is modest and low-cost, so the structural arc feels more like a well-shaped vignette than a fully compelling story.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—blackout → switch to analog methods → discovery of the matching sigil → alternative hypothesis → confirmation—reads cleanly, and closure as a conceptual repricing of his life’s work is legible. The piece maintains a single scene frame with reflective shadings and returns at the end to the changed present (lights back on, new stance). That said, the coincidence of the family sigil in an ancient city never faces skepticism or complication, and there’s little sense of options narrowing under pressure. Structure is solid and coherent but lacks a genuinely testing turn or visible price in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: workshop → preparation of final lantern → journey → basilica → release and return, with a clear before/after emotional state. Causality is straightforward—he processes the last dream, then physically brings it to the basilica, triggering his partial release—without teleports or rule breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief reweighted into “a beacon of hope” with visible cost in his tears and lingering pain. Escalation is modest and mostly emotional/ritualistic rather than sharply turned, which keeps it out of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: crystal detects pool → systems overload → window to descend → harvest → return with upgraded geode and new resolve. Structure (observatory → surface → observatory) is clean, and orientation is never in doubt. The main weakness is that the mission proceeds without complication, so while closure (he has harvested a major pool and commits to more) is clear, the lack of a real turning point or cost makes the arc feel more like a procedure than a story. Closure reads as a mild resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—pilgrim’s warning → observatory wakes → Maya flies the drone to trace star trails → observatory responds → pull sequence—reads cleanly, and the single-scene structure is coherent. The drive lens is Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and the closure beat (recognition of belonging + system completion) lands as a Conceptual Repricing. However, stakes are largely abstract and the cost of failure or success is never concretely dramatized, so the final change has limited bite. The missing-connection tension is noted but resolved smoothly, without a true crunch point.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: his longstanding trade → obsessive shore searches → discovery of the grandfather’s carving → revaluation of his life choices and a concrete decision to close the business. Structure is linear and coherent, with one main tightening at the moment he finds the unfamiliar carving. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing, with his future tactics (real histories) redefined. The main limitation is that much of the conflict is recounted rather than dramatized, which keeps escalation modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene on the parapet, with clear orientation and a straightforward progression from preparation to ritual to apology/forgiveness. Causality is intact—Lyra’s timing, the object, and the setting all lead to Rennett’s softening and apology—but the actual prisoner exchange and its practical stakes remain off-stage, which blunts narrative impact. The closure unit (apology/forgiveness as a decisive change in their relationship) lands, yet it comes with little resistance or complication. Overall, the piece reads more like a well-shaped vignette than a fully pressured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is simple but solid: job loss in the morning → decision to paddle → internal reckoning on the water → reframed relationship to her craft and past error. The situational lens (one contemplative outing under emotional pressure) holds cleanly, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration of the compass and her self-concept—lands with legible before/after. Stakes remain almost entirely internal and the on-page turn is gentle rather than sharply escalated, so the sense of cost is more implied than visceral. Structure is cleanly one scene with backstory woven in without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is coherent: procedure → mysterious ball/newspaper → deciphered coordinates → tunnels → meeting younger self → completing the loop. The story achieves a clear closure unit via conceptual repricing: the protagonist realizes they are both seeker and traveler and chooses to perpetuate the cycle. However, several important beats (the month of haze, the decoding of the paper) are summarized instead of dramatized, softening structural impact. Stakes and constraints could be tightened around the tunnel choice and the meeting to heighten the sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: phoenix event → new possibility → orchard ritual → summoning → farewell, with no orientation issues and a clear single scene. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts remaining mortal while holding a transformed understanding of love and connection. The cost of risking metamorphosis and only gaining a brief, partial reunion is legible but somewhat cushioned by the ease of her return to “herself again.” Escalation is smooth but relatively predictable, limiting the ceiling for an elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure—a ritual in the glade followed by a time-jump to the daughter’s birthday—forms a coherent arc with a clear before/after in her stance toward time. Causality is gentle but legible: she seeks the place where lost time accumulates, performs the ritual, experiences a revelation, and later lives differently. Closure functions as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing, with emotional cost visible in her acceptance that time cannot be reclaimed. Still, the path to success feels frictionless; the ritual never truly threatens to fail or backfire, softening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: lifelong preparation → cultivated rift → stitching with the tear → opening of the locked dimension → crossing over. The structure is essentially one continuous ritual scene with interwoven backstory, and the closure is decisive and legible with a clear before/after. What’s missing is any substantive on-page risk or reversal; the “one wrong stitch” danger is asserted but never tested, so escalation feels smooth rather than pressured. Still, as a causal, ritual-driven progression toward a singular consummation, it holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is legible: detour → encounter with prophesying girl → realization → release/gifting of the bugs, and the story lands a clear before/after shift in Ian’s understanding. The closure (him relinquishing the bugs and accepting himself as an agent of change) is on the page with a conceptual cost. However, tension is low because everything aligns conveniently—prophecies, dreams, cosmic timing—without real obstruction or risk, so the arc feels pre-smoothed. Ian’s coincidence power and the prophecy mechanics are asserted rather than tested, which keeps structural stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → use of the sundial to transmit coordinates → summons to the Keeper → confirmation → power returns, with the message now active in the world. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the ordinary sundial now encodes a revolutionary gathering, and the “embers” of change are lit. However, the central task is never seriously threatened—no true setback or complication interrupts or reorients the plan—so escalation and felt cost at the climax are modest. Structure is coherent but safe, with little surprise in how events unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: preparation, ritual escalation, eruption of star dust, realization, and a quiet denouement. Causality is coherent (stones → dust response → revelation), and closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration where her relationship to the curse and patterns changes. The cost, however, stays mostly abstract—her “risk everything” never manifests as a hard on-page threat or meaningful loss. This limits the impact of the otherwise well-shaped arc.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous, time-bounded scene in the observatory framed by the timer and the “when masks slip” window, with a clear beginning (ascent), middle (ritual, map, writing), and end (stepping out, resolved stance). The drive is accumulative/textural: the storm, the timer, and the map build toward a conceptual closure where she finds purpose and commits to sending her words back down. Causality is modest but coherent—each prop (timer, envelope, map) triggers the next beat—and orientation is excellent from the first line. The main limitation is that the closure carries conceptual rather than situational cost; no on-page consequence tests her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: decode the sundial → mentor the student → head to the symposium with new coordinates in hand. Causality is coherent, and the closure unit is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration in which waiting is reframed as productive revelation. However, the stakes of decoding and the symposium remain entirely off-page, so the decisive change carries little cost or urgency. The drive lens reads mostly Situational/Accumulative and holds, but without much tightening toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: we move from solitary rebuilding to a charged, almost liturgical closing image of ongoing, holy labor. Causality is coherent and orientation is clear early—who, where, and when are never in doubt. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his work is reframed as “rebuilding the world…one luminous fracture at a time,” with the cost implied in persistence and danger. Still, escalation is modest and largely expository; there’s little sense that options or risks noticeably tighten over the course of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failing compasses and impending shutdown → research and plan → archive descent → projector/film → liminal refuge. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when are established early, and the single POV holds. Closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—he steps into a space “between moments” and will return changed, with a conceptual cost tied to time and risk. The only shortfall is that the plan unfolds almost too smoothly, with minimal on-page obstruction or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: fading memory → seed + dreams → journey to waterfall → ritual in stone circles → awakening of ancestral voices as monsoon begins. Orientation is strong from the opening; time pressure and goals are never in doubt. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after—her people’s memory is restored and Elara is transformed by sudden ancestral knowledge, with some cost in overwhelm and doubt. The structure is somewhat straightforward and risk-averse, but technically solid and fully coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: daily ritual → new lace pattern → confession → reconfigured compass behavior and emotional state, with closure in the final charged image. Causality within this mode holds: the altered lace pattern and confession plausibly precipitate the compass’s transformation and the emotional repricing. The cost—facing long-suppressed truths and partially easing but not erasing the “severance”—is legible, though it remains gentle and largely interior. The piece could push further by staging one sharper present-moment dilemma or risk rather than resolving entirely within the safety of solitary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story fails the Orientation Test; it relies on iterative time ("Each day," "weeks ago") rather than grounding the reader in a single, specific scene with immediate stakes. Closure is an assertive summary of a realization, lacking a dramatized turning point or visible cost. The narrative structure is a synopsis, not a story.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot advances through unearned realization and "dream logic" (chemical plates + frost = decoding a ledger) rather than causal action. The resolution violates the cost proof test, as the protagonist arrives at the answer instantly without paying a price or facing an active obstacle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causal pressure or escalation; the protagonist attempts her method and succeeds immediately without obstacle or reversal. Closure fails the cost requirement, offering a purely positive realization ("felt lighter") without a visible trade-off or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a short story, violating the single-scene scope default by jumping across days and locations (study, cliff, submarine, library) without transitions or pressure. Causality is lubricated by extreme convenience (a captain owing a favor, finding coordinates on the frame, puzzle pieces fitting automatically), resulting in a linear "and then" progression without structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from a severe causal break at the climax: despite establishing that provisions are scarce ("would grow even scarcer"), Elias resolves the crisis by expanding distribution to an entire region. This treats willpower as a substitute for logistics, resulting in an "explain-everything" ending that feels unearned and disconnects from the established reality of the sanctions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causal tension; the protagonist desires an answer and receives it immediately through a magical object without complication. The "weeks later" epilogue deflates the scene’s intimacy by summarizing a career outcome rather than letting the closure beat resonate on its own. The story relies on a "and then" progression where success is instantaneous, bypassing the necessary deepening of the central event. Orientation is functional, but the pacing rushes past the climax (the projection) into a summarized resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates the short-story scope by summarizing weeks of time ("Days after," "Late one evening") without establishing a mosaic pattern, resulting in a synopsis feel. The narrative relies on linear "and then" progression, and the middle time-jump deflates the tension of the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on significant conveniences (an arrow doubling as a lockpick) and spatial inconsistencies where a "chained" character freely navigates a room. Closure is a "total victory" summary with no visible or felt cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a decisive change with price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central dramatic struggle (capturing the sound) occurs in backstory ("Last night"), leaving the present scene without active pressure or causal drive. The resolution relies on a magical shift in the object ("sound began to change") rather than a character choice, resulting in unearned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality is weak; the stationmaster's exit is unmotivated (filing a report immediately after a casual conversation), removing all obstacles for the protagonist. The "flower codes" are stated to grant access "exactly as planned," but the text does not dramatize how an arrangement of flowers mechanically or socially unlocks the jar, creating a logic gap. The resolution relies on a magical "light show" that solves the mystery without active deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear process description without causal tightening or obstacles; the glass does not break, and the kiln does not fail. Closure is a thematic declaration ("Thus, we thaw") rather than a reconfiguration of stakes with visible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative but lacks the pressure required to earn the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story relies on a "magic key" resolution where a seashell instantly provides coordinates and a thematic realization ("vulnerability") defeats armed antagonists without logical causality. The ending lacks a decisive on-page change with visible cost; the protagonist simply stands up and asserts victory through a mindset shift that does not address the physical threat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, utilizing the fading star effectively as a clock to drive the pacing. Closure lands via a legible Conceptual Repricing (recontextualizing night as a canvas), though the mechanism of the book glowing on its own slightly undercuts the protagonist's agency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where obstacles (protocol) are dismissed immediately, leading to a low-tension discovery plot. The causal link between cleaning and temporal transcendence relies on "magic object" convenience rather than character agency or logic taught early in the story. Closure arrives as a mystical dissolve that feels like a synopsis of an ending rather than a dramatized scene with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on summary and convenient leaps, such as a ticket doodle forming a map, rather than causal scene work. The ending dissolves into a "days that followed" synopsis that explains the social resolution ("mistrust... began to thaw") rather than showing a decisive change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear situational logic, but the closure feels like a reaffirmation of the status quo rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The looming arrival of the scientists provides a frame, but the protagonist's actions (routine placement of marbles) do not actively engage with or alter this pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural structure where the experiment succeeds without obstacle. The closure is an unearned victory lap that lacks the required Decisive Change with visible cost; the outcome is inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies on a massive convenience (a grand piano sitting "miraculously untouched" in a flooded theater) to resolve the central conflict, breaking causal logic. The closure is costless and symmetric; the problem simply dissolves into peace without sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative loop—from the fever dream to the discovered coordinates pointing back to the collapse—is coherent within the story's metaphysical logic. Closure is decisive and grounded in a physical departure, though the "hidden map in the drawing" relies slightly on genre-specific convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality relies heavily on the massive coincidence of the radio broadcasting a confession specific to this factory at the exact moment Marcus finds the wheel. The closure is a summary realization ("he'd found what he came for") rather than a dramatized change, and the "drowsy alertness" functions as a convenient plot device rather than a causal driver.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is sound with a clear situational loop of departure and return. The resolution relies on a conceptual reversal ("loose grip" becomes "anchor") that happens rapidly, making the closure feel slightly convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is functional and cohesive, with clear orientation and a complete scene structure. However, the resolution feels convenient—an external event (eclipse) triggers the breakthrough seamlessly—and the closure lacks a significant, dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension "and then" structure where discoveries (diaries in a hearth) occur via convenience rather than causal effort. Closure is a weak "soft reset" (a smile and a promise to continue) with no visible or felt cost. The resolution relies on a summarized information dump regarding the axis rather than a dramatized climax.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.8)
    The piece is a summary synopsis rather than a dramatized story; it lacks a specific scene, inciting incident, or causal chain of events. Closure is a reaffirmation of the status quo ("smiled") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is linear and lacks genuine reversals; the priest applies his method and succeeds without complication. The resolution feels mechanical, relying on a "magic system" logic rather than earned narrative causality. The orientation is clear, but the lack of resistance flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist exerts will and succeeds without a decisive turn or tactical shift. Causality is driven by "soft magic" (the shell glows simply because he focuses) rather than a grounded interaction with the setting or obstacles, leading to a symmetric satisfaction ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of prompt elements without genuine causal complications or reversals. The closure relies on a "realization" ending that acts as a soft reset, resolving the central tension through an epiphany that lacks a felt or enacted price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative fails the short story scope default, functioning as a synopsis spanning months ("autumn gave way to winter") rather than a specific dramatized scene. Causality is soft; obstacles vanish instantly (the drum maker's skepticism, the physical impossibility of the premise), and the ending is a generalized summary of success rather than a specific closure event with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on a significant coincidence (finding the tube) and a closure action that breaks causal logic. Releasing a government carrier pigeon would typically return it to its home loft (the authorities), effectively handing the evidence over to the villains rather than "broadcasting" it to a resistance network. The mechanics of the resolution undermine the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a straight line from inciting incident to resolution without meaningful complications; the technology works perfectly to solve the emotional problem. The closure is "tidy" and explains away the central conflict, offering a soft reset rather than a resonant reconfiguration with paid stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (make pattern, have epiphany) without causal resistance or a decisive turn. The closure relies on a "soft reset" realization ("Time... was a landscape") that resolves the intellectual query without demanding a price from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative structure is episodic and repetitive ("Every morning," "Each evening") until an unmotivated epiphany ("One evening... Kael realized") triggers the climax. The resolution is too tidy, lacking a "because/therefore" causal chain or any visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story follows a linear procedure without causal complications or reversals. The ending is a soft reset (routine completion) that fails the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on extensive summary and multi-year time jumps ("The next week," "Years later") that violate the short story scope, replacing scene pressure with synopsis. Causality is weak because problems are solved instantly off-page (e.g., funding found immediately), removing narrative tension. The ending is a thematic summary rather than a dramatic closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.0)
    The structure relies on a montage ("Days dissolved into nights") to bridge the gap between setup and resolution, violating short story scope by summarizing the core conflict. The climax hinges on Mira's convenient, unearned knowledge of "forgotten tales," resolving the mystery without active protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on convenient logic, such as the water slowing to form a "map" that removes investigative agency. The ending glosses over the physical catastrophe of a giant waking beneath a city, creating a logical disconnect with the established spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: ritual performed, vision received, optimism restored. Causality is soft; the magic functions conveniently to provide reassurance without requiring a difficult choice or enacting a visible price. The ending offers a tidy summary of feelings ("puzzle with a solution") rather than a closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on a significant plausibility break where the protagonist intuits complex audio content and catalog numbers from a tape fragment solely through touch and "sense memory," contradicting the established preservationist logic. Closure is weak; the protagonist defers agency by hiding the solution for a hypothetical future discovery, lacking a decisive change or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("The following days," "Weeks passed," "One morning") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short story scope defaults and dissipating tension. The inciting incident and climax are separated by vague summaries of time, preventing the accumulation of immediate pressure required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure collapses into a "fix-it" summary ending that spans years ("When visitors eventually came"), dissipating scene tension. The pivotal arrival of the old woman is purely coincidental, and the resolution lacks a causal cost, reading as a net-positive transaction without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path without pressure, relying on explanation ("she now understood") rather than tactical choice. The ending offers a tidy, summary-based resolution (Conceptual Repricing) unearned by prior struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a broad summary of events spanning days rather than a dramatized scene with causal links. There is no specific on-page closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration); the ending merely summarizes ongoing success, and plot points arrive via convenience (visions, the diary) rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression—he finds the box, enters the vault, and accepts his destiny without obstacle or reversal. The ending serves as a setup for future stories rather than providing a self-contained resolution with paid cost. Causality is driven by magical convenience rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis covering months and years rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope requirements for short fiction. Causality is weak; events unfold smoothly without obstacles (she finds it, understands it, and succeeds immediately). The "Orientation Test" fails as the timeline blurs into a generalized season/era without a concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot relies on a heavy coincidence (finding the amulet fragment exactly as the storm hits) that undermines causal agency. While the ending offers a Decisive Change (leaving the sanctuary), the realization leading to it is instantaneous and unearned ("realized... it offered answers"). The narrative bridges key moments with summary explanations rather than dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "smooth run" trajectory where every obstacle (guard, door, safe) yields immediately to preparation. The lack of an on-page complication or "micro turn" flattens the dramatic arc; the climax is a task completion rather than a narrative peak.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative structure is a static procedural loop, describing a daily ritual without a deviation, inciting incident, or decisive change. The ending returns to the status quo without a visible cost or a reconfiguration of meaning, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative fails to establish a specific scene window, relying instead on iterative time ("Each morning," "By day") that prevents causal momentum. There is no dramatized closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration); the piece ends with a static thematic assertion rather than a structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on convenience, as Evelyn stumbles upon the exact tools needed and uses them with instant proficiency to solve the riddle. The resolution is an "explain-everything" realization that resolves abstract stakes without personal cost, and the typo "Evelyncompleted" disrupts the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates as a synopsis or montage ("For three nights," "As the carnival continued") rather than a dramatized scene. The climax is anticlimactic and distanced, occurring via a notice posted on a bulletin board rather than an on-page confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes outline ("symmetric satisfaction") where the protagonist waits, succeeds without complication, and leaves. The causality of the central device is forced; using a dissolving sand grain to time a visual event that she is already watching is logically fragile and exists solely to integrate the prompt object.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.2)
    A fundamental causality break undermines the narrative: a "completely blind" protagonist uses a visual method ("watching how light bent... reflecting") to diagnose the drone. The ending is a "Soft Reset" where the problem is solved perfectly without cost, and the prompt's logic regarding the disability is ignored for convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary ("For three days...") to bypass the actual journey and discovery, violating the scope default of a continuous scene or distinct shards. Causality is weak; he succeeds because the plot dictates it—following a bird and a dream—rather than through problem-solving under pressure. The closure creates no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative structure (diagnose, walk, fix) that is coherent but devoid of causal turns or setbacks. While the closure (restoration) is clear, it feels inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist encounters no significant resistance from the magic system or the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a convenient "lock-and-key" progression where the artifact functions perfectly on the first attempt, removing mechanical friction. The ending utilizes a deus ex machina rescue that arrives exactly on time, negating the survival stakes and resulting in a "symmetric satisfaction" closure with no visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative structure is a mechanical loop of three identical cycles, repeating the same beats and phrases without causal progression. The "before they find the bodies" stake acts as a static refrain rather than a driver of plot or escalation. Closure is weak, merely restating the initial condition of wanting to tell the truth without an earned turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative momentum stalls significantly in the middle third (paragraphs 7-12) for a heavy backstory dump that explains rather than dramatizes. The closure relies on an epilogue with a new POV (the groundskeeper) to explain the significance of the bloom, rather than letting the ghost's final action stand on its own strength.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis of a fable rather than a dramatized story, violating the default scope of a continuous scene or shards. Causality is magical and inevitable rather than driven by consequence; events unfold without resistance or distinct turning points. The closure is a summarized realization of success without an on-page cost or decisive change in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis or montage spanning "seasons" rather than a dramatized scene, which prevents the accumulation of tension. The premise relies on a severe credibility break—archaeologists permitting an untrained stranger to reconstruct a primary find—which undermines the causal chain immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear vignette (observe, draw, reflect, mail) rather than a causal story; the "climax" is merely completing a chore without an obstacle. The closure relies on a shift in perspective ("begun to understand") that feels asserted rather than earned through the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies on a "magic wand" causality where stitching a map inexplicably causes real-world accidents without established rules or costs. The ending functions as an "explain-everything" summary that resolves the conflict via montage rather than a dramatized pivotal moment. The mechanism of resolution (embroidery affecting reality) is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative follows a linear wish-fulfillment path with no causal pressure or cost; the protagonist asks for a message and receives it. The presence of a "large, smooth window" standing unexplained in the center of a mangrove swamp breaks setting logic and orientation. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction ("I forgive") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is statically observational, relying on reflective backstory rather than active pressure to generate volume. Closure is a "soft reset" (a comforting lie) that lacks a visible, felt cost or a decisive change in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative relies on broad summary rather than dramatized scenes, compressing what should be a complex process (discovery, research, persuasion, execution) into a synopsis-like list of successes. There is no scene-level causality or resistance; obstacles like the town council are dismissed in a single sentence, and the "perfect" resolution lacks earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative structure is a linear checklist of magical events ("first awakening," "second awakening") without causal friction or necessary obstacles. The plot lacks a drive lens that forces a difficult decision; the closure acts as a conceptual upgrade rather than a resolution with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis or backstory summary rather than a dramatized scene, failing the scene-anchor requirement. The timeline drifts through "five years ago" and general habits ("Kaelen remarked") without establishing a concrete "now" until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the short-form scope default by summarizing "centuries" of action instead of grounding the reader in a single scene or two-shard sequence. There is no structural tension or causal chain of events, only a linear chronicle of success ("transformation began," "centuries passed," "poet reached the end"). Closure is a thematic fade-out rather than a decisive change earned by on-page tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative arc is a linear procedural (find crack → fix crack → success) with no complication or deviation to generate narrative drive. The closure is a return to status quo without a felt price; the resolution feels inevitable and unearned because the preservation process faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot is a linear progression of effort leading directly to success, lacking a decisive pivot or causal twist. The resolution feels convenient—finding the perfect text just in time—rather than earned through a difficult trade-off or tactical shift. Closure is prospective (anticipating the meeting) rather than a realized change on the page with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot hinges on a jarring causality break where complex chemical analysis is performed on a mossy ruin floor with a "specialized solvent." The resolution is unearned; the protagonist discovers a convenient answer left by a predecessor rather than engaging in a decisive change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative structure fails the scene test, relying on broad summary ("span of days that grew into weeks") rather than a continuous dramatized event. Causality is weak; the protagonist follows the dictates of a magical object without skepticism or agency, leading to a frictionless resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where the resolution—the logbook code magically rearranging into the word "Home"—is an unearned *deus ex machina* rather than a causal result of the protagonist's struggle. The ending offers a "soft reset" reunion that erases the established separation without exacted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, tour-guide structure with no resistance or causality; Maya simply moves from room to room until an epiphany occurs. The lack of obstacles turns the plot into a sequence of events rather than a story. Additionally, the physics of removing a glove in a flooded, deep-sea environment breaks plausibility without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure, but the resolution relies heavily on a deus ex machina (the bird's seeds) which instantly solves the central mystery. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (disappearance is metamorphosis), but because there is no visible or felt cost paid by the protagonist to achieve this, the structural weight is light.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where the protagonist's plan works perfectly without obstacle, resulting in a lack of narrative drive. The causality is brittle; the specific coincidence of the quartet playing the exact right song relies on implausible omniscience rather than narrative logic. The ending provides closure but fails the rubric's requirement for a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies heavily on a coincidence (finding the speck) to resolve the central tension, functioning as a Deus Ex Machina that instantly enables the "fledging" process. The closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no active opposition in the scene, and the "sacrifice" is negated by her immediate acceptance of it, failing to register a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak, relying on an "inexplicable force" to initiate the scene rather than character choices. The closure is a conceptual realization ("soft reset") that feels unearned because no narrative price was paid. The narrative arc is linear but lacks the pressure required to make the ending feel inevitable or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static reflective vignette lacking causal pressure or a decisive turning point; the protagonist arrives, thinks, and leaves without a shift in options. Closure serves as a "soft reset" where internal peace is declared without a visible, paid cost or structural reconfiguration. The orientation is clear, but the lack of external friction renders the narrative drive inert.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of competence without complication, lacking a decisive turn or obstacle that forces a change in tactics. The closure represents "Symmetric Satisfaction"—the ritual simply works as intended—missing the required felt or conceptual cost to give the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes discovery chain that relies heavily on convenience (finding the exact diaries and film needed in a random fireplace). Closure is achieved through intellectual summary rather than a dramatic turning point with visible cost. The causality is functional but lacks tension or unexpected shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    The structure is a static procedural: arrival, ritual, and departure, with no causal turn or decisive change. The ending returns to the status quo ("familiar melancholy") without a legible cost or reconfiguration of values.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from severe "telling" in pivotal moments; the central negotiation—the story's climax—is summarized in a single sentence ("By midday... Elian had successfully navigated"). This elides the causal struggle entirely, leaving no dramatized arc, only a setup and a retrospective resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a functional linear progression with clear physical movement and closure. However, the climax relies on the convenient coincidence of the drought breaking exactly at the moment of release, which feels mechanically orchestrated rather than causally earned. The narrative orientation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with low causal density; actions (dancing, untangling) lead immediately to results (opening, liberation) without unexpected obstacles or complications. The ending is a predictable transcendence that feels inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist faces no meaningful setback or failure condition during the attempt. Orientation is stable, but the plot lacks the tension of genuine uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear summary of a successful evening with no causal resistance or cost. The ending creates no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; it merely resets to the status quo with a "next project" plan. The "epiphanies" act as unearned plot coupons rather than causal turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure that functions as a vignette but lacks a decisive turning point or high-stakes causality. Closure provides symmetric satisfaction—a ritual completed—without a visible cost or a reconfiguration of the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the central resolution relies on a massive coincidence: the street organ card’s pattern perfectly matches a centuries-old ceremonial rope. This convenience removes the need for trial, error, or adaptation, flattening the narrative arc into a simple execution of a pre-ordained solution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where a nap and a dream sequence solve a lifelong disability without tactical trade-offs or sacrifice. The climax lacks external pressure, as the storm functions as a convenient battery rather than an antagonist, dissolving all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot is linear and low-tension, proceeding from preparation to success without significant obstacles or reversals. The ending ("covenant with the unknown") lacks a legible cost or decisive change; the ritual simply works because the protagonist wills it, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot relies on magical convenience rather than causal progression; the "cellular memory" mechanism functions as a shortcut to resolve deep-seated trauma without effort. The ending introduces the brother via a "shifting reality" Deus Ex Machina, bypassing the need for Marcus to take concrete action in the real world.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear path with a clear Cause/Effect chain: repair leads to vision, vision leads to decision. The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing, shifting the sextant's purpose from capture to navigation. The logic of the magic system is consistent, though the reliance on repeated phrases to explain the mechanism makes the causality feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Returning the next day," "Days later") that dissipates tension and violates the single-scene default without earning it. The resolution—a magical seed appearing to solve the estrangement—lacks causal weight or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a frictionless linear progression with no obstacles or reversals; the "bathroom breakthrough" serves as a convenient deus ex machina rather than an earned turning point. The ending asserts a "decisive change" (enlightenment) but fails to dramatize the process or the cost, resulting in a low-impact resolution that relies on abstract assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the climax (the negotiation) resolves too easily without sacrifice, and the actual rescue is summarized ("delicate process of extraction") rather than dramatized. Closure is achieved through possession of the diary rather than a difficult decision or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: arrival, exploration, use of magic key, epiphany. There is no causal deepening or tightening of options; Elara faces no resistance from the environment or her own limitations, making the resolution a "soft reset" where she simply accepts a new purpose without paying a visible cost. The inciting incident (receiving the card) is stuck in backstory, reducing present-action momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, obstacle-free path: find door, enter, fix rope, succeed. There is no meaningful tightening or deepening of the situation; the "puzzle" is solved instantly with "practiced precision," robbing the climax of tension. The closure lacks cost, offering a tidy "happy ending" that ignores the established danger of the "fables of absence."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure that dissolves into a summary-heavy epilogue ("Days passed," "Years later"), violating the short story scope. Closure fails the cost requirement; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the problem transforms into a benefit without the protagonist paying a visible price (e.g., losing the stone, sustaining injury, or sacrificing tradition).

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a dream ("shard of hush") and a convenient meteor sighting to solve the central problem, undercutting agency. The closure is a "success state" without a legible felt or conceptual cost; the limitation that the light "would not last forever" reads as mitigation rather than a price paid for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory (observe -> descend -> record) that lacks a decisive turning point or causality gap. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the character simply fulfills his established role without facing a complication, surprise, or meaningful cost, resulting in a static ending.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear progression without obstacles; gates open automatically, the recipe is found immediately, and the performance succeeds perfectly. The closure resolves the abstract problem of "hopelessness" without any visible cost or complication, resulting in unearned symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story builds to a climax that is summarized rather than shown; the pivotal response to Aris is narrated ("resumed not with a direct answer... but with Maya's observations") rather than dramatized in dialogue. The resolution feels like a soft reset where a practical funding crisis is solved by a metaphorical insight without logical causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, following a clean Voyage and Return pattern with a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure (doll plus vessel). However, the plot lacks a strong causal pivot or obstacle; the gravity inversion functions as a ride rather than a test, and the success feels inevitable once the ascent begins. The ending brings closure but the cost—the reluctance to descend—is told rather than dramatized through a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "process" structure (plan, execute, succeed) without an inciting incident to disrupt the status quo or a moment of risk. Closure is a "Mission Accomplished" beat that lacks the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; success is inevitable and unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative is a linear checklist of tasks with no causal friction or reversals. The closure acts as a "soft reset" (task complete) rather than a reconfiguration with cost, failing the cost proof test entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal arc with a legible Decisive Change at the ending (opening the door). However, the progression is mechanical; the external signal (ring) immediately overwrites the internal goal (isolation) without significant tactical maneuvering or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is linear and reliant on convenience, specifically the "pressure plate she had noticed earlier" which functions as a deus ex machina to resolve the climax instantly. Closure lacks the required cost; the protagonist achieves a "miracle" and wealth without sacrifice, trade-off, or risk, resulting in an unearned "happy ending" that violates the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the solution (finding the paper) is achieved without complication or cost, failing the closure requirement for a paid price. The causal link between the gramophone and the secret compartment relies on "technobabble" convenience rather than logical progression. The ending resolves the central conflict off-page ("council meeting tomorrow"), resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear acquisition path: find object, perform ritual, succeed instantly. The closure (becoming a guardian) lacks a felt price; the transformation is presented as a pure gain, missing the "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" needed to validate the arc. The lack of complication or setback flattens the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on a significant time jump ("Months later") that dissipates immediate tension and bypasses the process of the search. The resolution depends on the coincidence of the button's owner walking in to deliver closure, rather than the protagonist forcing a result through agency in the dramatized moment. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a significant deus ex machina—the puddle reflection spontaneously forming a map—to resolve the central obstacle, breaking causal logic. The climax is mechanically resolved by a key fitting an "unexpected slot" without requiring a hard trade-off or ingenuity. The escape is too tidy, lacking the friction or cost expected in a high-stakes rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a flat, linear trajectory (arrival, setup, performance, success) with no meaningful turns or complications. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the conflict is resolved by a single action without resistance or consequence. The pacing is mechanical, moving from point A to point B without causal density or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without causal disruption or meaningful stakes; Elara finds an object, uses it exactly as intended, and succeeds immediately. The ending is a soft reset (a smile and a sense of satisfaction) lacking the required closure unit (Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing) with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving efficiently from the attic to the greenhouse. However, causality relies heavily on the "magic compass" to bypass narrative friction, and the resolution comes too easily via observation rather than a decisive, pressure-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: despair, idea, immediate success, happiness. The "failed attempts" occur off-page, leaving the on-page action devoid of causality-driven struggle or setbacks. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved on the first try without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with no meaningful reversals, orientation debt, or complication. The resolution is inevitable ("The spectral confession would eventually come"), removing tension from the pursuit. The ending lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, reading as a routine success ("job done") rather than a changed state.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    The climax hinges on a convenient, unearned mechanism where a torture device physically fits a pattern on the forest floor, breaking causal logic. The resolution—an abstract epiphany about mercy—feels triggered by this magical interaction rather than a hard-won character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the solution (lens + painting) works immediately without complication or cost. The closure is an "easy win" that resolves the premise without requiring a sacrifice or meaningful adaptation from the protagonist. Causality is soft; the magic works simply because the narrator wills it, lacking mechanical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience; Marcus finds the crucial mainspring barrel "half-buried" simply because it "glinted," acting as a teleporting prop. The closure is tidy and unearned, resolving a lifetime search with a single, low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and resolution, though the "seven days" transition relies on summary that dilutes tension. The closure effectively reframes the premise (preservation to flow) with a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from a "magic art" resolution where a complex societal conflict is resolved instantly by a single manuscript, bypassing necessary causal steps. The climax ("Hours later... astonishing") is summarized rather than dramatized, removing all tension from the actual turning point. The ending is a "soft reset" that dissolves the problem without earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" summary structure without genuine causal turns or setbacks. The resolution relies on a convenient conceptual leap (rust equals dishonesty) that solves the problem via magic without exacting the required on-page cost. Closure is "symmetric satisfaction," resetting the world without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (hike, cave, water, epiphany) with negligible resistance. The "hinged awakenings" structure feels artificial and prompt-driven rather than causally earned. Closure offers a conceptual reframe ("connected all along") but lacks a visible or felt cost; the protagonist gains wisdom without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure sequence where obstacles (dead GPS) are trivialized and solutions (magic slide) appear conveniently. Closure is achieved through a thematic summary of feelings rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the inciting incident (a postcard) leads to immediate travel without complication. Closure arrives via a convenient epiphany that incurs no visible or felt cost; the caretaker's lack of opposition removes necessary causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a developed story, violating the scope default of a continuous scene or shard. Causality is soft; the captain agrees instantly to a detour, and the "parley" mechanism functions via unexplained magic without established rules or cost. The ending summarizes weeks of subsequent career success rather than landing a specific closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is essentially a summary of a thought process rather than a dramatized scene; the epiphany arrives without an on-page catalyst or obstacle. The resolution (townspeople immediately arriving) feels like unearned convenience rather than a causal result of the protagonist's internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is functional, moving from stasis to vision to resolution, but the causality relies on a magical object mechanic ("accidental prophecy") that just happens to the protagonist. The closure acts as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of his duty, but the path there lacks necessary friction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the protagonist attempts a complex ritual and succeeds without complication or setback. The resolution relies on an abstract assertion of understanding ("texture of herself") rather than a dramatized shift in the character's state or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a linear path to "symmetric satisfaction," where the protagonist's belief is confirmed exactly as predicted without complication or sacrifice. The climax—the bell ringing itself—blurs mechanical plausibility with magical realism ("no human hand touching it") in a way that undermines the "science vs. digital" premise. The ending offers vindication but lacks a Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist simply goes to a place and receives wisdom without obstacle. The climax lacks causal density, relying on a convenient "call" rather than a pressure-driven decision, and the resolution arrives as a declared epiphany rather than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on summary ("years before," "day after day") rather than a continuous dramatized scene, violating the scope default for this length. Causality is soft and dreamlike; the resolution arrives through the accumulation of time rather than a pressure-driven decisive change in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot advances through convenience and unearned epiphanies—specifically the "suddenly timeless" moment—rather than causal protagonist agency. The closure fails the "visible cost" requirement, offering a symmetric satisfaction where Elara gains purpose without sacrificing anything or facing a difficult trade-off. The narrative arc lacks a decisive turning point, reading more as a linear accumulation of information than a story of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure functions as a linear vignette with weak causality; the central event (the kite string snapping) is a convenient metaphor rather than a consequence of the protagonist's actions. Closure is achieved through a soft internal realization ("beginning again") that lacks a visible, felt cost or a genuine reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the short-form scope default (single scene or two shards) by summarizing six months of action, reading more like a synopsis than a dramatized narrative. There is no specific onsite pressure or closure unit; the ending is a summarized arrival rather than a decisive, earned moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: walk, enter, place object, enlightened. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist gains understanding without paying a visible price or making a difficult trade-off; the resolution relies on the "fly amber" acting as a magical key rather than character agency. The drive lens is weak, as the "revelation" feels inevitable and unearned by the walk itself.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "Years later" epilogue is a structural failure, deflating tension by summarizing a perfect victory rather than letting the on-page closure resonate with cost. Additionally, a severe text generation glitch ("ttk duelersi") in the second paragraph interrupts causality and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative fails the short story scope constraints, operating as a synopsis of a months-long journey rather than a dramatized scene. The linear "fetch quest" structure lacks causal pressure or pivotal turns, resolving through summary rather than earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a story; there is no inciting incident, rising action, or causal chain. The ending offers no structural closure or cost, merely a reiteration of the initial state with a summary of emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot operates on video-game logic (insert item A into slot B) without causal pressure or unexpected complications. Closure is a "magic button" reset that lacks cost, and the Master's arrival functions as a deus ex machina to deliver exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic: walk, spell, unbind, result. However, the causality of the magic system is vague (how does walking spell words that manifest pawns?), and the flow is severely disrupted by the foreign-language artifact near the climax, which creates a stutter in the narrative reality.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis spanning weeks rather than a dramatized story, violating the single-scene expectation without establishing a functional mosaic pattern. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist realizes the answer perfectly with no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a logical contradiction: the backstory claims the prince "died," yet he is merely "suspended" and alive at the end, creating a "soft reset" resolution where the central tragedy is undone by magic without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—total forgiveness and restoration—which undermines the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal turns or active obstacles; the "climax" is a solitary recitation shadowed by passive antagonists, resulting in a theoretical outcome rather than a dramatized shift. A significant foreign-text glitch ("hadтайное") disrupts the reading flow and signals a lack of basic proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure from stasis to ritual to epiphany, providing legible closure via Conceptual Repricing. However, the causality is soft; the transition from recounting trauma to the profound realization about kintsugi feels like an intellectual leap granted by the author rather than a necessary consequence of the workshop tilting or the ritual itself. The orientation and drive lens are stable, but the turning point lacks mechanical grip.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution relies on an implausible coincidence (finding a specific 20-year-old artifact via a random wrong turn) that undermines causal agency. The survival of a painted shell in a tidal cave for two decades strains physical credibility without establishing a magical realism frame. Causality is broken; the environment gifts the solution rather than the protagonist earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" with no causal resistance; the experiment succeeds immediately without cost or failure. The omniscient jump to the sister removes all narrative tension and ambiguity, validating the magic instantly rather than earning the realization. Closure lacks the required "visible or felt cost"; the protagonist gains everything while paying nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where instructions are received and executed with immediate success. The ending offers a thematic summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a major coincidence—finding a second perfect glass eye immediately after the ritual—to provide resolution and thematic validation. This undermines causal agency; the ending functions as a reward for "worthiness" rather than a consequence of the protagonist's choices or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on a middle-section summary ("For days Elias experienced...") that dissipates tension and violates the short-story scope default without earning a mosaic structure. The resolution is unearned; the realization arrives not through a dramatized breakthrough or consequence of the investigation, but because the narrative declares the story complete.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge (&quot;Days passed&quot;) to span the middle, which diffuses the tension expected in a short story. The logic of the &quot;promise&quot; and the arrival of the chip is convenient and unexplained. Closure lands, but the shift from physical journey to metaphorical realization feels disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails the closure requirement by dissolving into a "Years later" summary instead of landing on a concrete scene beat. Causality is weak, driven by convenient dreams and a mentor who appears exactly when needed, removing narrative tension. The narrative arc resembles a synopsis rather than a fully dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central plot mechanic—the secret—is a black box withheld from the reader, breaking the causal chain; we see the result (artistic change) but cannot trace the logic of *why* this specific secret caused it. The closure is a "net gain" epiphany without visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magical aid" structure where the scroll and aurora resolve the protagonist's confusion externally. The transition from struggle to clarity is caused by the environment acting upon Elias ("symbols beginning to glow," "began to soar") rather than his own agency, leading to a low-cost return to stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative structure is linear and functional but suffers from "Symmetric Satisfaction," where the problem (lost screw) is resolved immediately with no complications. The closure is purely additive (gain-gain) without the required "visible or felt cost," rendering the dramatic arc flat and the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear success arc where the protagonist overcomes the obstacle without a felt price or resonant reconfiguration; the resolution (success signaled by the quill tip) feels tidy. The "breath between storms" provides a ticking clock, but the causality of the solution (remembering a knot ritual) feels like a soft reset of the magical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, establishing the archive and the orchard clearly. However, the structure lacks a complication or decisive turn; the ritual succeeds immediately, and the resolution is a straight line from intent to satisfaction. The closure is legible but feels unearned due to the lack of causal obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative tracks a linear, frictionless path where the solution perfectly matches the problem without complication or failure. The closure relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—an "explain-everything" ending where a magic book resolves cosmic fragmentation instantly. The "hiccup" timeframe provides a theoretical window but generates no on-page urgency or pacing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the shift from scene to summary epilogue ("As the years passed") dissipates the immediate tension. The causality follows a fable logic where an action leads immediately to a total philosophical realization without significant resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on an unearned realization—identifying strangers as "predecessors"—that dissolves the central conflict without cost or logical groundwork. The ending offers a symmetric satisfaction where a potential threat creates a partnership, lacking the required felt or conceptual price for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc; the central turning point relies on a massive, unearned coincidence (a random subway scrawl matching her private encryption work). Closure is a "soft reset" to peace without visible cost or consequence, and the lack of active scene pressure flattens the trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot follows a linear, low-tension path where the inciting incident immediately resolves the central conflict without complication. The closure is a summary of emotional state ("no longer felt haunted") rather than a dramatic event, functioning as a "soft reset" that erases the problem without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative traces a clear, linear path to a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression is ritualistic and lacks causal density. The closure lands via a predictable completion of the drawing; the "regenerated covenant" serves as a static concept rather than a mechanism that forces a difficult trade-off or unexpected turn.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative violates the scope defaults by relying on outline-like sequencing ("Fifteen minutes later," "By week's end") to summarize weeks of action instead of dramatizing a specific scene. There is no causal pressure or resistance; the plan succeeds instantly without complication, failing to meet the requirement for an on-page cost or decisive change born of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative is a linear fetch-quest with no obstacles, reversals, or meaningful cost; Elion wants the stillpoint, walks to it, and receives it. The resolution relies on a "magic healing" trope where touching the ground resolves complex grief instantly. The ending is an "explain-everything" summary that asserts a change in state without earning it through narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure with no meaningful obstacles or escalation. The resolution—a magical fix that works perfectly "the next morning"—bypasses the requirement for on-page cost or consequence. The story explains the theory of the solution rather than dramatizing the tension of its execution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story functions as a vignette without a causal drive; events happen sequentially but lack a "because/therefore" chain that narrows options. Closure is a thematic summary rather than a dramatic consequence of the protagonist's actions. Head-hopping between characters (woman, fisherman, child) without section breaks diffuses focus.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing years of action rather than dramatizing a single scene or shard. Causality is weak, relying on a convenient "invisible thread" message to resolve the central mystery. The closure is a synopsis of a life path rather than a felt, on-page shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    The plot relies on convenience: Elena's ability to disable monitoring systems by "drumming on diagnostic panels" is a "magic key" solution that bypasses plausible obstacles. The escape lacks friction, and the climax—while visually resonant—feels inevitable rather than earned by a struggle against the facility's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.8)
    The climax relies on a causality break: Marlo whispers instructions "five minutes earlier" that travel through channels to a security post, yet the physics of sound delaying for five minutes is implausible without established magic rules. Additionally, Vance is shouting for directions at the exact moment the whisper supposedly "accomplished what shouts never could," creating a contradiction in the timeline of the resolution. The logic of the trick—the story’s pivotal moment—is unintelligible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is static, relying on an accumulated visual description rather than causal progression or complication. The closure is a "soft reset" where the conflict (the secret) is resolved by looking at light patterns, lacking a decisive change or paid cost. Causality is replaced by atmospheric assertion; the ending feels unearned because the pressure was never tested.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("The next three weeks became a dance...") to bridge the inciting incident and resolution, bypassing scene-level struggle. While the closure is legible, the lack of obstacles or visible cost makes the "success" ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure relies on sequential "and then" plotting ("The next dawn," "Then came the evening") rather than causal pressure. The ending offers a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply vanishes into a dream world, dissolving all tension without a paid price or meaningful complication. The inciting incident (finding the scrimshaw) leads linearly to the conclusion without unexpected obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story functions as a static vignette or character portrait rather than a narrative with causal drive. While the "Conceptual Repricing" at the end is legible (restoring emotion), the lack of a specific incident or rising pressure makes the closure feel like a restatement of the opening stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot follows a linear "and-then" progression of a ritual enactment without causal pressure or deviation. Closure fails the "felt cost" requirement; the ending is a "level-up" moment of pure gain where the character acquires power and wisdom without sacrifice. The narrative relies on convenience, with the environment welcoming the protagonist rather than testing them.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a summary of events rather than a causally linked plot; obstacles are nonexistent as the glassblowers and Gideon comply immediately. The resolution relies on a "happy ending" reset where everyone gains ability without cost, directly contradicting the premise of "bartered" awakenings and violating the requirement for closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    The structure is a linear demonstration of success with no complications; the ending is a soft reset ("picked up another artifact") rather than a closure unit with visible cost. The narrative lacks a causal chain that forces a change in state or perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=2.1)
    The piece fails the fundamental requirement of narrative: it is a synopsis or generalized summary of a routine ("Every night," "Visitors often arrived") rather than a specific dramatized scene. Without a concrete "when" and "where" anchored in time, there is no causality, no sequence of events, and no closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on summary and convenient dialogue ("You must be the mathematician") rather than dramatized causality. The resolution—a massive discovery made over tea—feels unearned because the process of discovery is asserted rather than shown through struggle or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path with minimal resistance; the solution (randomness) works immediately upon application. While a conceptual change occurs at closure (merging), the ease of resolution and lack of orientation detail rob the ending of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure driven by observation rather than causality or rising pressure. The reliance on watching silent video footage acts as an exposition delivery system rather than a source of conflict or tactical change. Closure lands with a resonant image, but the "understanding too late" cost is dampened because the relationship was not established earlier in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a static vignette of reflection lacking causal pressure or a decisive turning point. The resolution—a declared balance of self-respect and compassion—feels unearned by the scene's low-stakes interaction with the chameleon.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot advances through massive coincidences and assertiveness rather than causal logic; coffee stains perfectly matching ancient stone walls disrupts suspension of disbelief. The narrative relies on "explain-everything" realizations where the protagonist simply "understands" the solution without testing or failure. Closure is achieved through abstract affirmation rather than a decisive change in the world or a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful actions with no obstacles or causal density. The closure (projecting the film) is a foregone conclusion from the first paragraph, lacking any twist, resistance, or cost. The structure feels like a checklist of required interactions rather than a driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a "soft reset" ending where the central problem vanishes due to a magical realization without any paid cost or complication. The resolution relies on a convenient ancestral fix ("stardust in her veins") that removes the obstacle instantly, failing the closure requirement for a decisive change with felt cost. The orientation in time and space remains abstract and dreamlike, lacking grounding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on "magic wand" causality (e.g., using "wave functions" to bypass all obstacles instantly). There is no resistance, complication, or cost to the mission; he arrives, succeeds without setback, and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear progression of events with no causal friction or obstacles; success is immediate and unearned. The closure relies on a "Gift" ending—a realization that solves everything without extracting a visible price or foreclosing any options. The "it was all in his mind" resolution deflates rather than reconfigures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and tour-like: departure, arrival, acquisition, and return, without causal complications or rising stakes. The inciting incident (the leash breaking) opens a door, but the subsequent events lack resistance; the solution (stamping the air) is immediately available and works without cost or risk. Closure is present as a change in status (acquiring dragons), but it feels unearned due to the lack of prior obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.5)
    A significant causal break occurs when finding names on a bolt grants immediate, detailed knowledge of an ancient magical ritual. The resolution feels rushed and unearned, as the fortress yields to a single note without the expected resistance or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Weeks turned to months") rather than a pressurized scene, distancing the reader from the inciting action. The closure—a "Scooby-Doo" unmasking of the self—feels unearned because the antagonist (fear) was not dramatized, only stated at the end. The causality is abstract; writing in books somehow breaks a magical illusion without a clear mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, moving from observation to realization. While the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing (accepting Earth's reset), the climax relies on summarized intensity ("third night without sleep") rather than dramatized scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies on a Deus Ex Machina; the sudden appearance of an ancient stone circle in a spaceport repair bay breaks causality and suspension of disbelief. The narrative is linear with no complications or tightening of options. Closure is achieved through magical intervention rather than protagonist agency or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies on summary ("For three days," "decades fighting") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope defaults for short fiction. Causality is broken by a massive coincidence—the kite blowing exactly to her feet with the necessary key—which removes protagonist agency. Closure is achieved without cost, offering a tidy, unearned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.8)
    The structure violates the short story scope by summarizing years of history ("generations," "just last spring") rather than grounding the reader in a single, pressurized scene. The "present" action is confined to the final moments on the cliff, rendering the majority of the text as exposition. The timeline is diffuse, preventing the accumulation of immediate narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality is symbolic rather than dramatic; the solution (sorting threads) is convenient and lacks a visible, paid cost on the page. The "descent into necessary darkness" is summarized as a metaphorical process rather than a dramatized event, reducing the closure's impact to a tidy, unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear success path (setup, action, success, explanation) without meaningful reversal or complication. The orientation is stable, but the closure relies on a lecture to a drone rather than a dramatized consequence of the "dangerous fluctuations."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story functions as a coherent synopsis but lacks scene-level causality; the protagonist finds the letter and uploads it "in seconds" without obstacle. The resolution relies on the convenient appearance of "dormant networks," a Deus Ex Machina that removes the need for tactical ingenuity. Closure is a Decisive Change, but the lack of resistance makes it feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece functions as a vignette or mood portrait rather than a narrative with a functional arc; there is no rising pressure, and the ending ("another day's work complete") offers cessation rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. The drive lens is unclear because causality is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural structure: the fisher waits, performs his technique perfectly, and succeeds without setback. The inciting window ("timeframe when patterns broke") leads directly to a guaranteed success, lacking a "try/fail" cycle or a moment of genuine jeopardy. Closure is a symmetric "happy ending" that confirms the premise without exacting a visible cost or forcing a reconfiguration of the character's world.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies on a "magic solve" resolution where the protagonist looks at papers and suddenly deduces the entire truth without showing the logical steps. The causal link between charitable donations and innocence is weak—many corrupt figures donate to charity—making the "proof" unconvincing. Closure is achieved without cost or sacrifice, lacking a true decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a "magic button" resolution where the protagonist achieves his desire without complication or cost, violating the closure requirement for felt price. The causality is weak—the discovery of the letters "yesterday" is a convenient backstory patch that removes narrative pressure from the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative suffers from a "magic wand" resolution where the central conflict is solved instantly by the protagonist's art without struggle or earned causality. The "unlearning" and the zealots act as low-stakes window dressing for a plot that lacks resistance or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear procession of events without causal pressure or obstacles; Elias finds the tile, places it, and succeeds immediately. The closure relies on a "magical fix" where the environment shifts in response to a ritual, lacking a sense of earned change or consequence. The sequence feels like a parable or outline rather than a dramatized scene with cause-and-effect weight.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without causal deepening; the inciting incident (timeline unraveling) is abstract and resolved instantly by the protagonist's specific skill without complication. The connection between the "fractured timeline" and the "song" is asserted via magical logic rather than earned through narrative friction. The ending is a soft reset that resolves all tension without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where a magical object simply solves the central problem without logical causality or setback. The closure is a "magic feather" resolution—the protocol works immediately because the plot demands it—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost. Causality is replaced by technobabble ("interaction with human energy fields") that feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no causal complications or meaningful tightening of options. The ending fails the closure requirement as it provides a success outcome ("renewed purpose") without a visible felt or conceptual cost; the protagonist simply acquires the object and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where organizing buttons magically unscrambles a mist prophecy, lacking causal rigor. The closure fails the on-page requirement, dissolving into a summary montage ("Visitors... soon heard") rather than a dramatized scene with a decisive change. Causality is abandoned for a "and then it worked" progression.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scene is structurally coherent but static, relying on internal reflection rather than active causality. The closure works as a change in stance (Decisive Change), but the inciting drive is low-pressure and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette depicting a routine ritual rather than a story with causal progression or stakes. Closure is merely the cessation of rain and the completion of a task, lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The sequence of events is linear but devoid of tension or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path of observation without causal complications or obstacles. The resolution—healing the land via pottery movements—feels like convenience magic rather than an outcome earned through tactical choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience and coincidence; finding an unlocked, seaworthy rowboat in a modern city harbor is implausible, and stumbling upon the one man (Jim) who knew her grandmother resolves the tension via chance, not agency. The causal chain is weak, driven by the need to hit prompt targets rather than logic.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis or outline rather than a scene; it lists internal states without causal linkage or external pressure. The ending is a "soft reset" where the protagonist "finally understood" the solution without paying a visible price or facing a test. Cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: protagonist arrives, looks at object, has realization, leaves changed. The causality is weak; looking at a bird's nest triggers a total worldview shift without intervening complications or resistance. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" where she decides to write for herself, but the ease of this shift makes it feel unearned. The "thread" logic feels circular and convenient rather than a hard-won discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem-solution-success" path without significant obstacles or reversals during the scene. The ending dissipates tension through an "explain-everything" summary of the following week, validating the victory via external news rather than a resonant closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but lacks significant obstacles; the "fallow period" functions as a convenience to remove external conflict. Closure is a Decisive Change, but the path to it feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    Major credibility gaps undermine the procedural plot. A silk ribbon would not survive twenty years of exposure in a quarry, directly contradicting the "evidence disappears" constraint. The climax relies on "magical" forensics (matching a body frame to rock indentations from a 20-year-old struggle), resulting in unearned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution hinges on high convenience (a nail acting as a precision key for a 50-year-old system that works instantly). Heavy expository blocks in the first half stall momentum, and the closure is a decisive act that feels unearned by immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causal drive; the environment accommodates the protagonist ("the world seemed to listen") rather than resisting him, removing all tension. The conclusion is a "magical solution" where he simply ascends, offering a dream-logic ending that lacks a legible, earned cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative dissipates tension by summarizing the "unwinding" of the startup rather than dramatizing the decisive moment of failure. The time jumps dilute the central scene's pressure, and closure relies on a stated realization rather than a causal consequence of the meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on extreme convenience; the telegram arrives exactly when needed, and the variable stars instantly transform into legible glyphs without trial or error. The resolution is an "explain-everything" ending where the solution is handed to the protagonist rather than earned. Closure lacks any visible or felt cost; the "burden" is shared with a smile, bypassing the required price for a Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a mechanical list structure (circles 1 through 7) that kills tension and causality. The resolution is too easy—the plant simply eats the obstacle—and the "glamour" twist lacks sufficient setup to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence ("and then") with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The ritual succeeds immediately upon execution, and the resolution relies on a convenient magical shrinking mechanic without established rules or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure: arrival, confrontation, and immediate success. There is no moment of doubt, failure, or meaningful resistance that jeopardizes the outcome. The closure is a tidy restoration of status quo without a felt cost paid within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear situational arc with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist revalues the object and his own history. The pacing is steady, though the inciting incident (looking at a scrap) is low-pressure. The orientation is solid, establishing the "who/where/when" effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis or prologue rather than a dramatized story; it summarizes a sequence of actions (researching, packing, boarding) without a distinct central scene or pivot. The ending is a "threshold crossing" (boarding a vessel) that promises future action rather than providing a structural closure to the specific arc of the seed or the mentor's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a descriptive loop of a routine ritual rather than a causal story; there is no inciting incident to disrupt the status quo. Closure is circular ("the cycle continued") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or legible cost paid on the page. The piece functions more as a vignette of world-building than a developed narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where obstacles are non-existent and solutions are immediate. The causality operates on dream logic—the protagonist finds a magical object that instantly grants understanding and superpowers—bypassing the need for narrative tension or earned resolution. The closure is a "happy ending" unearned by previous choices or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on significant coincidence; finding precise hydrographic data regarding a lost river in random bathroom graffiti strains credibility. The narrative progression is linear and lacks resistance—Elena enters, finds the exact clues needed immediately, and proceeds to the resolution. Closure is present (playing the accordion) but feels unearned due to the convenient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest ("and-then" sequencing) lacking a causal gap or decisive turn. The inciting incident (the letter) and the climax (entering the library) are connected by compliance, not struggle. Closure is soft; the protagonist leaves simply because a deadline is mentioned, not due to a meaningful reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—reconfiguring the violin’s essence into the plant—lands with a distinct conceptual cost (destruction of the original). However, the resolution relies on convenient, pre-identified magical mechanics and a time-jump ("Hours later") that bypasses the procedural tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending merely concludes a routine task. Mechanical contradiction undermines causality: Elara "infuses" memories into the body's cells yet simultaneously captures them in the stone to store in a vial.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, tour-like structure (climb, enter, realize) with adequate orientation but weak causality. The resolution relies on a convenient epiphany triggered by looking at an object, lacking a visible cost or a moment where the outcome was genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure where an external tool (chimes) resolves the conflict, bypassing protagonist ingenuity. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction—the client simply accepts the advice—without the required "decisive change" or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear lesson plan without causal complications, risk, or meaningful turns; the outcome is never in doubt. Closure relies on a magical assertion of success rather than a result earned through specific character action or wit.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procession of compliance: Kael waits, sees birds, walks, and succeeds instantly. There is no resistance or causal pressure; events occur because "today was different" (convenience), and the closure is a foregone conclusion without cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary, compressing the journey and the subsequent societal shift into montage rather than fully realized scenes. The ending lacks the required cost; Elias achieves his goal, gains wisdom, and transforms his society without sacrificing anything or facing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fable structure is coherent and the closure (magical transformation of the lamps) is legible. However, causality is soft, relying on "pulls" and "waiting" figures rather than active progression, fitting a Situational lens with low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the protagonist simply realizes the answer without earned causal struggle. The "backwards prophecy" is introduced as a complex constraint but resolves via a simple visual pattern (a spiral) without utilizing the "backwards" logic, leaving a gap in causality. Closure is achieved through a sudden, low-cost realization that resets the stakes to a happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the problem (eternal heartbreak) is solved instantly by a symbolic action (naming) without causal friction or cost. The reversal of the map to reveal star realms is a convenient prop contingency that removes difficulty rather than complicating it. Causality is replaced by assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is weak; the solution ("weaving reality's threads") is an abstract convenience that resolves the central conflict without visible cost or setback. The "happy ever after" closure feels unearned because the "brittle devotion" supposedly expended carries no felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence; discovering a specific photograph of the protagonist's aunt "slipped between pages" is a convenient device that resolves the mystery without agency. The narrative lacks causal density, moving from discovery to resolution without obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a checklist structure with no causality or obstruction; the birds appear "as if summoned" to solve the only technical hurdle. Closure is a soft reset—success without cost or consequence—rendering the ending emotionally flat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure stalls significantly due to severe looping, where the same three beat sequences (radio clear -> inventive thought -> muscle memory action) repeat verbatim. While a basic cause-and-effect chain exists (anomaly -> interpretation -> transmission), the repetition drains all momentum. Closure is achieved through the transmission, but the journey there is circular and mechanical rather than progressive.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative momentum is stalled by a hefty exposition block regarding the "custody battle" in the middle of a high-stakes crisis. The climax relies on abstract magic ("channeling limited vitality") rather than a logical progression of tactics, rendering the resolution convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story operates as a vignette rather than a causal narrative; the protagonist reflects on a package but faces no significant obstacle or pressure. The orientation is clear, but the closure—a decision to design a room—feels inevitable rather than earned, as no alternative path was ever viable. The lack of a visible cost or risk reduces the narrative drive to a series of observations.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear accumulative logic, building sensory pressure until a resonant reconfiguration occurs with the heard giggle. The ending lands a legible closure (Earned Stasis/Acceptance) with emotional cost, though the "giggle" itself functions as a slightly convenient magical realism device to force the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.4)
    Causality is weak, relying on the coincidence of the pendant activating "today" because "magic had reached a critical point" rather than character agency or pressure. The inciting incident is external and arbitrary. Closure is achieved without a legible cost; the guardian simply leaves, framing the exit as a philosophical victory rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a mechanical "rule of three" structure (shimmer, glow, success) without genuine causal complications or distinct costs between attempts. The climax relies on an internal epiphany ("penny dropped") that lacks an external trigger or pressure, resulting in a resolution that feels convenient and low-stakes. The ending provides closure but lacks a felt price for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where the primary obstacle (noise) is instantly dissolved by a convenient tool (shard of hush). The climax relies on an internal "soft reset" without setup or consequence, failing to meet the requirement for a closure unit with visible cost. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through causality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with zero obstruction; the plan is executed exactly as intended without failure, adaptation, or cost. The inciting incident (midnight crossing) leads directly to success via button-pushing, lacking a crisis or climax where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot proceeds via unearned magical coincidence ("memories altered... something peculiar") rather than causality; the resolution is a Deus Ex Machina where the gallery grants his wish without cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Weeks passed," "Then came breakthrough") rather than dramatizing a specific, continuous scene with immediate pressure. This synopsis-like structure dissolves tension and reduces the climax to a reported event rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    The plot relies on a strained coincidence where a decades-old photo identifies a currently active predator, which resolves the central mystery too easily. The timeline logic regarding the predator's age and the protagonist's sudden access to crime data undercut the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is anecdotal—arrival, procedure, departure—lacking a decisive change, reversal, or felt cost. The ending resolves as a routine success with the protagonist feeling "purpose," which fails to deliver the required closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on a convenient epiphany where spilled ink instantly reveals complex system schematics without causal logic. The resolution acts as a soft reset, offering total understanding without obstacle or cost, resulting in an "explain-everything" ending that deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot resolves via the coincidence of the birds' new pattern rather than a decisive protagonist choice, failing the causal drive lens. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where success is total and costless, lacking the required felt or conceptual price for valid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative fails the scope requirement by offering a synopsis of three months rather than a grounded, continuous scene. The absence of a specific inciting incident or crisis on the page dissolves tension, resulting in a summary rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on convenience—finding the shell, knowing the statue's secret immediately—which drains tension from the inciting incident and climax. The ending dissolves into a "happily ever after" summary ("From that day forward") rather than landing a specific closure beat with visible cost, violating the short-story scope of focused dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "mission accomplished" path where the central obstacle is bypassed without complication. The closure lacks a legible on-page cost, as the protagonist succeeds completely and leaves feeling "lighter," resulting in a flat causal trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a linear "magic feather" structure where a found object instantly resolves the central deficit (silence/decay) without setbacks or consequences. The "wrong turn" functions as a convenient portal rather than a causal navigational choice, and the restoration ending lacks the "felt cost" required for a high-band literary close.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path from intent to success without significant obstacles or reversals. While closure is achieved through the scarf's dissolution, the causality feels mechanical—magical inputs lead directly to magical outputs without complicating friction. The drive lens is Accumulative but lacks a deepening of stakes before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality is severely undermined by a deus ex machina; the solution—a book that "hadn't been there before"—appears magically to resolve the central mystery. The closure offers no earned change or visible cost, relying instead on this convenient discovery to explain the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" procedure without a pivot point, reversal, or meaningful cost to the protagonist. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved by applying a magical key, lacking the required felt price for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain relies heavily on coincidence; the ring pulses and the stars align "tonight" without a clear trigger from Elara's actions after decades of waiting. While the closure is legible, the "why now" factor is weak, making the resolution feel unearned by immediate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure is solid, moving from instruction to demonstration to a test of the student's internalization of the lesson. The closure—Prisha standing her ground instead of walking backward—effectively dramatizes the transfer of resilience, satisfying the prompt's causality requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of magical success with no resistance, turning points, or cost. The plot lacks a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" because the protagonist never faces a risk that would make the outcome earned. Causality is replaced by convenient magic that functions perfectly on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the climax relies on a "False Box" conceit: the secret "tumbled from his lips" yet remains hidden from the reader, hollowing out the emotional payoff. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist faces no obstacles to her success.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative reads as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, skimming over months of work without a concrete anchor. The central plot device—continuous surveillance footage of a remote field dating back to the 1920s—strains plausibility and breaks causality. Closure is a conceptual realization ("Conceptual Repricing") but feels unearned due to the summary delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure depends on a convenient epiphany rather than causal progression; Elara simply looks and "finally understood." The climactic shift—the plane vanishing from the snow globe—is a supernatural event that resolves the ambiguity without requiring the protagonist to pay a price or take a decisive action. The ending explains the mystery rather than dramatizing the cost of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative fails to provide a scene; it is a synopsis of a situation ("This was the domain," "She would ascend") without a specific anchor in time or an inciting incident. There is no causality or decisive change, merely a description of a static routine that lacks an ending or earned closure. The orientation is abstract and "ethereal," missing the concrete grounding required for a story.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure is mechanically repetitive, using the elevator floors as a scaffold ("At floor two...", "At floor three...") that reads like an outline. The resolution relies on convenient adventure-game logic—holding the goggles to light—without establishing why this specific encryption method existed or requiring trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is static; the protagonist observes rather than acts, and the transition from peril to epiphany feels unearned by any on-page struggle or cost. Closure relies on an assumed rescue ("knowing that when rescue came") and an internal assertion of connection rather than a demonstrated change in the character's situation or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.0)
    Causality breaks when the protagonist intuitively identifies the coin as an "algorithmic key" without evidence; closure lacks a visible cost as success is total and unhindered.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot advances through convenient coincidences (a hopscotch board mapping perfectly to starling flight and a phrasebook) rather than causal logic. The narrative lacks a true inciting incident or rising action, skipping straight to an unearned resolution. Closure is a simple success state with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a flat line of events with no causal resistance; obstacles like the frozen doors and the lock yield immediately to the protagonist's touch. Closure arrives as a generic restoration of magic without any visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a meaningful price paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.5)
    The piece functions as a synopsis or historical summary spanning generations rather than a dramatized story with a distinct scene. It fails the orientation test by lacking a specific anchored moment, and the resolution is a broad timeline of success without a closure unit carrying felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear process description of a ritual, coherent but lacking causal surprise or deviation. Closure is a valid Earned Stasis (maintenance of the beam), but the cost is generic ("exhausted"), making the resolution feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is driven by extreme convenience; the protagonist finds the exact blueprint and power source needed for a specific crisis moments before it occurs. The narrative is a linear checklist of "and then" events with no genuine obstacles or logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "fix-it" epiphany where staring at river foam instantly resolves a complex interpersonal conflict and a scientific problem. The causality is weak; the insight feels unearned by the preceding action. The ending devolves into a summary ("weeks later") that dissipates tension and bypasses the actual work of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a low-tension vignette describing a lull and a ritual rather than a story with causal pressure or escalation. The "climax" (creating the door) is a procedural step in a scheduled opening, not a decisive change forced by conflict. While orientation is clear, the lack of an inciting incident or rising stakes leaves the story feeling like a prologue.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where obstacles are summarized ("journey... was treacherous") rather than experienced. The resolution—finding the pavilion and performing the task—feels inevitable and effortless, lacking the "felt or conceptual cost" required for effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing weeks of events ("The next day," "By the fourth meeting") rather than dramatizing a single scene or shard. This synopsis-mode approach prevents the accumulation of scene-level tension or causality. The closure is a "happy ending" montage rather than a earned structural shift, lacking the required scene-level pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the central obstacle (the broken mirror) is immediately revealed as a beneficial feature, negating conflict. The ending relies on a declared "permanent change" rather than a consequence derived from a pressurized causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks a dramatized climax; the central challenge—solving the puzzle—is summarized ("As Elara worked through each puzzle") rather than shown, stripping the scene of tension. Closure is a standard "mission accomplished" beat without a Decisive Change or felt cost, merely stating a "weight of responsibility" that isn't earned on the page. The pacing is steady but lacks the requisite tightening or deepening for a high-stakes short story.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (arrival, preparation, execution) that lacks a causal turn, reversal, or complication. While the closure achieves the character's goal, it arrives without a "Decisive Change" or significant cost, reading more as a vignette than a complete story structure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative suffers from a "suddenly" realization that breaks causality, offering a solution without an on-page trigger. The timeline is rushed via summary ("The third day arrived"), skipping the necessary escalation of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a circular convenience where the reward (instructions for the method used) merely validates the action without revelation or cost. The narrative lacks a pivot or setback; the obstacle yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on summary ("Days blurred," "seasons would change") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short-story scope defaults. The ending is a convenient realization without a decisive turn or causal snap; obstacles are mentioned ("danger," "mists") but never manifest as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails the closure gate: the resolution offers a "free win" where the protagonist gains total success without paying a visible or felt cost. The climax relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the glowing necklace) to provide exposition and solve the central mystery, stripping the narrative of causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story lacks a valid closure unit; the ending ("settled into her portable station for the night") is a soft stop that defers resolution and cost. The central mystery is solved via a sudden, low-stakes realization facilitated by a tablet, bypassing meaningful narrative tension or causality. Orientation is adequate, but the drive lens fails to escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a successful ritual without meaningful complication, deviation, or causal turn. The closure is a pre-ordained success state ("wonder made manifest") achieved without cost or trade-off, lacking narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the scene is structurally coherent, the causality is weak; the resolution depends on a "magic feather" mechanism where the ritual works perfectly on the first try without complication. The closure arrives via visions that explain the theme to the protagonist, removing the need for a decisive, high-stakes choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no meaningful tightening of stakes; Elara plans the experiment, executes it without resistance, and ends in the same position she started. The closure is a weak promise of future success ("would be cracked open") rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the present with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks causal pressure; obstacles like the "perilous" journey are smoothed over instantly by the pendant's magic, removing all tension. A logic error occurs at the climax where Ayla hands over her "mentor's last letter" but the tag reads "she wrote," creating confusion about authorship. The ending is a thematic summary rather than a dramatic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear success path with no obstacles; the protagonist tries the experiment, it works immediately, and she is happy. The mechanism linking the car window frost to the prism is arbitrary magic lacking causal logic, and the closure—while conceptually a repricing of her theory—carries no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative progression relies on dream logic where a "rummage sale box" inexplicably appears in an ancient forest, breaking causal immersion. The resolution is mechanical—touching an object to a bamboo shoot—rather than a result of ingenuity or distinct character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=2.6)
    The piece fails the basic requirement of a short story, functioning instead as a synopsis or fable-like summary spanning generations. There is no single continuous scene or dramatized "now"; events are narrated from a zoomed-out distance ("The first days," "When the village elders came," "To this day"). Consequently, there is no structural tension or on-page closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure relies on a summary montage of alternate realities rather than a causal chain of events, preventing tension from accumulating. The ending acts as a "soft reset" (waking up to try again) without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or paid cost, leaving the narrative static. The pacing stalls in description rather than advancing through beat-by-beat pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.7)
    The climax is resolved via summary ("repaired connections restored") rather than dramatized technical action, undercutting the physical stakes. The discovery of the loose floorboard relies on convenient coincidence immediately after finding the sea glass.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where the protagonist faces a genuine obstacle; the resolution (guiding the fleet) is achieved through established routine without visible cost. The ending offers success without sacrifice, failing to land a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story relies on summary ("Three weeks after," "Each dawn") rather than a continuous scene, preventing causal pressure from building. The resolution is a low-stakes realization without a distinct "before/after" cost or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, building toward a moment of alignment, but the climax relies heavily on coincidence (the condensation drop) rather than protagonist agency. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of sorrow) is legible, the causal chain leading to it feels mechanical and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear process of success without a decisive turning point or meaningful setback. Closure is achieved through task completion, but the ending lacks a legible "felt cost" or sacrifice required by the rubric; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative lacks a genuine causality arc; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains connection without sacrificing solitude or paying a cost. The ending fails the closure requirement of "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" by offering a "have it all" conclusion where the society member instantly validates her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on the "explain-everything ending" anti-pattern, where a letter conveniently resolves the central mystery and emotional arc. Causality is weak; the decision to read the letter now, rather than when it was found, lacks pressure or distinct trigger. The resolution is performative for the reader rather than a character-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with weak causality; the pivotal discovery—that vows can be reinforced—arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than a result of specific struggle. Closure is soft, relying on a promise of future "painstaking" work without an immediate, felt cost or decisive change in the current scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.9)
    The climax suffers from opaque causality; the text asserts that the note proves the lieutenant's betrayal without establishing the logical link for the reader. The narrative structure is mechanical, explicitly labeling structural devices (e.g., "her first false start") within the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory: wait, meet, accept, transform. There is no complication or deepening of the dilemma; the "revelation" is handed to the protagonist by a mentor figure rather than discovered through struggle. The closure feels inevitable and unearned, as the "choice" to converge is presented without a visible alternative or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.9)
    A severe continuity error breaks causality: the portrait is described as being hidden in the cave "after that terrible criticism" years ago, yet the protagonist also recalls the cleaning woman finding it in his studio "this afternoon." The narrative attempts to have the prop in two places simultaneously to serve different flashbacks, confusing the timeline. Closure feels unearned because the central obstacle is resolved by a simple decision without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative structure is a "packing the bag" prologue rather than a complete story; it ends where the actual conflict should begin. Causality relies on convenient discovery (finding the map "yesterday") and video-game logic (artifacts glowing when placed together) rather than character agency or earned insight. The closure creates a promise of future action but fails to resolve a present-scene tension with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece is a synopsis of a life rather than a dramatized story; it violates the scope default of a scene-based narrative. Events unfold in a linear "and-then" sequence with zero causal friction or resistance. The ending is a foregone conclusion from the moment of discovery, lacking a distinct closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure is distinct (singular to swarm), but the causal mechanism connecting the "box of fears" to "miniaturization" relies on poetic assertion ("fueled the transformation") rather than narrative logic. The transition feels rushed and slightly magical.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and coincidence (the convenient arrival of the locket, the survival of the key holder) rather than causal pressure. The logic of a "locked mailbox" remaining untouched in a "defunct post office" for thirty years strains credibility, and the resolution feels unearned by the protagonist's low-stakes inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks causal friction; Elara attempts the solution and succeeds immediately without complication or cost. The ending dissolves into a summary of future success ("renaissance of discovery") rather than landing a specific, resonant closure beat within the scene. The causal link between "random dice rolls" and "deciphering complex algorithms" is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear "Symmetric Satisfaction" arc where the protagonist wants X and finds X without complication or twist. The discovery relies on convenient absence of authorities and soft magic (coffee grounds) that yields immediate results, lacking a "Decisive Change" or structural cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual procedure without causal friction or deviation; the outcome feels foregone from the start. Closure is achieved through assertion rather than a dramatized turning point with visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary ("weekly ritual") to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and the climax, flattening the dramatic arc. Closure is achieved through explanation rather than a decisive change with felt cost; Clara gains knowledge without sacrificing anything, resulting in a low-impact resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence where magical interventions resolve the plot without protagonist agency or ingenuity. The closure is purely asserted; the "archiving" happens because the story says it does, not through a causal chain of earned breakthroughs. The prompt-driven structure is visible, leading to a mechanical resolution that lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the key arriving with "yesterday's supplies") and unclear causality; it is illogical that modifying a hidden document in a cave would legally restore water rights in the capital. The mechanism of the key dissolving and opening solid marble is unexplained magic that resolves the central problem without earned effort.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on summary and convenience rather than causal progression; the protagonist faces no genuine obstacles and the resolution is immediate. The ending lacks a felt cost, offering a tidy "moral of the story" conclusion that feels unearned. The piece reads more like a synopsis than a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis rather than a story, relying on broad summary ("Night after night," "One by one") instead of grounding the reader in a single, pressurized scene. This summary mode creates a complete lack of immediate causality or orientation, violating the scope requirements for short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on iterative summary ("Each evening," "When firefly season arrived") rather than a specific anchored scene with causal drive. Closure is absent; the story ends in a loop of status quo without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative breaks the scene window with a massive summary bridge ("For days, she worked"), effectively turning the piece into a synopsis rather than a short story. Causality is weak, relying on convenient discovery (the box behind the pipe) and a mental leap ("began to intuit") rather than pressure-driven action. Closure is asserted rather than earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative violates the default scope by summarizing years of history ("year became decade") instead of grounding the reader in a single, high-stakes scene. Consequently, there is no specific "now" where causality operates; the ending is a symmetrical restatement of the beginning rather than a consequence of a specific on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" path where a magical object resolves a complex social issue without resistance or failure. The inciting incident (finding the box) occurs in backstory, and the climax (playing the music) lacks an obstacle. Closure is achieved, but the lack of significant cost or sacrifice makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where a threat is introduced and immediately neutralized by a pre-existing, perfect solution (the tuning fork). The resolution relies on a "magic button" mechanic rather than protagonist ingenuity or sacrifice, resulting in a weak closure that restores the status quo without meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a vignette rather than a causal story, lacking a decisive change or felt cost; the "revolution" is declared rather than dramatized. The ending relies on the confirmation of a pre-existing theory with no obstacle or complication, failing to generate narrative momentum or closure urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe logic break occurs with the discovery of the note, which inexplicably contains both 19th-century Underground Railroad secrets and modern-day maintenance logs on the same paper. This conflation acts as a convenient Deus Ex Machina that resolves the mystery instantly without plausible causality. The coincidence of a fresh corpse clutching an antique lantern in a functional subway tunnel strains suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure relies on a contrived premise where the protagonist visits a repair shop seeking a quote he cannot afford, only to deliver a prepared monologue about why he won't fix the item. The closure (leaving it broken) is valid, but the causal path to get there is logically flawed and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction outline where obstacles are solved immediately by convenient tools (kaleidoscope translating symbols instantly). Closure is achieved mechanically ("No one heard it, just as predicted") without a felt cost or decisive change in the protagonist's stance. The causal chain is weak; events happen because the plot requires them, not because of character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers from heavy summary and convenience, particularly the "subtle lie" that instantly grants access to high-security areas without complication. Orientation debt is significant; the physical location of the protagonist is vague until the final paragraph, leaving the action floating in a metaphorical "digital" void. The ending transitions too abruptly from discovery to escape.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: problem presented, magic used, problem solved. The causal mechanism—using memories of mirrors to fix a crystal—is asserted rather than grounded in the story's reality. Closure is a simple success state lacking the required Decisive Change with visible cost; the ending feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure path where the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by hard choices. The closure (deciding to stay) relies on a conversation and a gentle realization rather than a decisive action taken under pressure; the "euthanasia tourist" premise dissolves too easily into a standard healing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story is a static vignette with no causal progression or inciting incident; it functions as a looping list of reflections rather than a narrative arc. Closure is an unearned conceptual shift ("rediscovering purpose") with no visible cost or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: preparation, execution, and departure. The closure reads as "task complete" rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending creates no new constraints or meaningful changes in the character's status beyond the successful checklist completion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a ritual that succeeds exactly as planned, lacking causal friction or unexpected complications. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where magic resolves the undefined "tragedy" without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist. The mechanism of the "arcs" functions as a black box convenience rather than a dramatized causal tool.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is static, lacking an inciting incident, rising action, or genuine pressure; it functions more as a vignette than a story. The closure—a conceptual realization that his work is translation—feels unearned because there was no prior obstacle or cost to overcome, merely a sequence of thoughts in a vacuum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "tour guide" character who appears conveniently to explain the central mystery (the arch's purpose) and then vanishes, a classic "explain-everything" anti-pattern. This interaction resolves the plot through external information rather than protagonist agency or deduction. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without a felt cost or decisive change in the character's status.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality breaks at the climax; retuning perception sensors should not physically stop seismic foundations from shaking. Orientation is muddled by contradictory cues: viewing the moon implies an Earth location, yet the "silence" and "lunar observatory" title imply space, while placing a clock "outside" ignores atmospheric reality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with no causal tightening or meaningful reversal; the "broken record" setup resolves instantly without cost or difficult trade-off. Closure is biological rather than narrative, lacking a decisive change in stance or understanding earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without tension or reversal; the protagonist uses a key, closes loops, and receives an answer immediately. The ending functions as a "Part 1" setup rather than a closed story unit with cost, offering a "press button, get result" causality that lacks narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical success without complication. The mechanics of the ritual are smoothed over by narrative assertion ("bone setting must work across realms"), lowering the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative fails to establish a specific scene, relying instead on habitual summary ("Every night," "would climb," "would weigh"). Without a concrete "now" or specific incident, there is no causal arc, only a synopsis of a routine and a generalized timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is functional but linear, lacking significant resistance or causal density. The closure relies on a "Months later" flash-forward that explains the outcome rather than letting the immediate scene carry the weight of the transformation. The connection between the icicle pattern and the specific location feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or a distinct inciting incident within the scene; it functions as a static tableau of reflection. The closure—placing the shell—feels like a ceremonial gesture rather than a hard-won decisive change, as the "peace" is declared rather than earned through on-page friction. The orientation is vague, relying on abstract concepts ("feral nexus") rather than grounded coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative is a linear summary of success lacking a dramatic scene; the "magic vine" functions as a convenient deus ex machina that both initiates and solves the problem. There is no on-page closure cost; the ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved perfectly on the first attempt. The structure relies on "and then" sequencing rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural describing a ritual without a causal turn, complication, or felt cost; the "success" feels inevitable from the start. The ending offers a miraculous resolution that does not require the protagonist to sacrifice or change.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies heavily on summary ("Days turned to weeks") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—the broken machine is fixed—without a Decisive Change or a felt cost that alters the protagonist's stance or world.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative structure is strictly linear and repetitive, adhering to a checklist-like accumulation of beats without complicating pressure. The closure relies on a "soft reset," where the protagonist's internal struggle dissolves instantly upon seeing a vision, lacking the "felt cost" or decisive change required for a resonant ending. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the escalation feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.0)
    A severe causality break undermines the story’s "practical" premise: carving a hardwood ash blank into a detailed lion with a "broad mane" and "serene eyes" within the five-minute boil of a kettle is physically impossible. The narrative arc lacks resistance or a pivotal turn, relying on this magical leap to reach closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on convenient magical solutions where metaphors (a bridge of words) become literal without established causal rules. The resolution is unearned, as the ghost accepts the offering immediately, stripping the climax of necessary friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.9)
    Causality is broken by "magic engineering"; rewiring dormant transformers in a disconnected facility cannot generate power without a source, shattering plausibility for an engineer protagonist. The ending relies on unearned convenience, where the sextant inexplicably reveals equations under the lights, functioning as a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative provides a clear beginning, middle, and end with a legible closure act (offering the watch). However, the inciting incident for the change—the bear’s arrival—is a convenient coincidence that resolves the conflict for him. The plot moves via atmospheric drifts rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest lacking causal complication; Elara arrives, finds the item immediately, and leaves without hindrance. The closure is a "realization" ending that feels unearned because there was no obstacle to overcome, resulting in zero narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is linear and lacks genuine causal pressure; the protagonist succeeds by passivity (sitting) and the reward is handed over rather than earned through active ingenuity. Closure is a soft emotional summary ("felt infinitely patient") with no legible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the pivot to self-reflection at the end provides legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the inciting incident and climax occur smoothly without significant obstacles or causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct climax and reversal (success then failure). Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing (the realization that beauty must grow, not be built), though the "quaking" serves as a convenient externalization of internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot lacks genuine causality; the resolution is achieved through external factors (the "migration of clouds" passing and other firefighters gaining control) rather than the protagonist's agency. There is no decisive change or cost; the ending returns to stasis without a meaningful reconfiguration of the character's world or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a friction-free fetch quest where obstacles are resolved immediately by innate traits or "patience," lacking earned causality. The climax involves a logic-breaking convenience (a window turning into a box) and ends with "symmetric satisfaction" where everything is fixed without the required closure cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and then" structure with no causal friction or obstacles to force a turn. The ending is a soft reset that returns the character to the starting point without a Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Days passed with the measured pace...") to bridge the gap between intent and resolution, skipping the actual dramatic struggle of the carving. The closure is a "success state" without visible cost or a decisive on-page turning point; the monument is simply completed as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot hinges on a causality break: a found rake handle bearing prophetic instructions that conveniently solve the central dilemma. The narrative lacks a logical inciting force for the solution, and the resolution arrives without meaningful obstacles or setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with arbitrary causality (e.g., the chess clock controlling reality is asserted but not grounded). The ending is a "soft reset" that returns to the status quo without the required Decisive Change or felt cost, failing the closure requirement. The magic system operates on convenience rather than established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure without meaningful reversals or causality-driven turns. The closure—writing the map—is a foregone conclusion established in the first paragraph, lacking any felt cost or surprise. The plot acts as a container for required elements rather than a pressure cooker for change.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative suffers from severe orientation confusion; the protagonist appears to be in her apartment in paragraph 2, yet broadcasts from a hillside alcove "outside the city" in later paragraphs without a transition. The story operates as a generalized summary of a habit rather than a specific causal scene, ending in stasis with no visible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a linear, accumulative structure (chair stops, work continues, realization occurs), but lacks a causal engine or rising pressure. The closure is a conceptual repricing of "safety," but it feels intellectually asserted rather than earned through a dramatized struggle or cost on the page. The narrative reads more like an artist's statement than a dramatic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with a situational lens but lacks meaningful tightening or escalation. The inciting incident (finding the cog) leads directly to a resolution (keeping the cog) that reaffirms the status quo without imposing a new visible cost or risk. Closure is an Earned Stasis, but the lack of pressure makes the "choice" feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=1.9)
    The narrative fails to anchor a specific scene, functioning instead as a chronological summary of a career spanning decades. There is no inciting incident or causal progression in a unified timeframe; the closure is a generalized legacy statement rather than a resolution of a specific on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of planting a seed, lacking causal turns or obstacles. Closure relies on a "promise of future change" rather than an earned, on-page shift in stakes or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on weak contrivances, such as a bureaucrat presenting a cryptic riddle to solve a technical crisis, and the saboteur surrendering immediately without resistance. Closure is a soft reset where the mechanical problem resolves itself off-screen after a conversation, devoid of visible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a linear, accumulative structure that resolves via magical convenience (objects glowing and humming) rather than character agency. The closure explains the mystery through this supernatural mechanism rather than an earned deduction or reconfiguration of the initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a lecture-style information dump followed by a magical vision that resolves the central tension without active struggle. The climax is transactional—receiving and opening the ampoule—rather than a result of causal pressure or a difficult choice. The story operates more as a philosophical vignette than a dramatized plot.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.5)
    The resolution relies on narrative convenience ("magic math" rupturing stone) rather than causal logic established in the world. The ending is a reset without a legible felt or conceptual cost; Elias escapes his confinement merely by completing a task, lacking a decisive trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear process description lacking a decisive change, obstacle, or cost-bearing closure. The ending is cyclical ("begin anew") and relies on a lack of pressure, offering no reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a "magic wand" device (the lens) that instantly solves the central problem without earned causality or significant cost. The connection between the lens, the bees, and the dough is asserted rather than logically developed, reducing the climax to convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect path, but the resolution feels unearned given the cosmic stakes. The protagonist alters reality with "adjustments" rather than a significant sacrifice or trade-off, making the closure feel like an easy win without a commensurate price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a linear "Simon Says" structure where the advisor commands and the protagonist complies, removing all causal tension. The resolution is unearned, dependent on a "magic book" (dream dictionary) that provides exact riddles to solve the conflict instantly. Closure is achieved through this deus ex machina rather than a decision with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure ("competence porn") where the obstacle is removed by a magical skill without complication or cost. The resolution is a soft reset—the storm simply diverts—depriving the story of the necessary tension or a decisive change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from an "explain-everything" ending where a discovered journal resolves all ambiguity via exposition dump. Causality is weak; a convenient tool (whistle) instantly solves a generational mystery without forcing the protagonist to overcome resistance or make trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear, resistance-free scavenger hunt where the protagonist simply follows instructions to a convenient discovery. There is no causal turn or earned climax; the resolution is handed to the character without deduction, risk, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a causal turn; the discovery of the box relies on coincidence rather than agency. The ending (Earned Stasis) feels circular and low-impact, as the character simply returns to his routine with a vague philosophical addition.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence—stumbling upon specific family scrolls in a "rarely visited" section immediately after the lights go out—which undermines causality. The narrative lacks a true crisis or decision point; the protagonist observes, confirms, and accepts without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is linear and frictionless: intention leads immediately to execution without complication or deviation. The closure—a feeling of peace—feels unearned because the preceding "ascension" lacks a dramatized cost or obstacle. The structure relies on explaining the backstory ("shadow detached") rather than using it to create active pressure in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless path (calculate, descend, harvest, return) without meaningful complication or reversal. The "circuit breakers" constraint functions as artificial urgency; it is declared but never forces a difficult trade-off or deviation from the plan. Closure is achieved mechanically but feels unearned due to the lack of prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the central obstacle—"unexpected variables"—is resolved immediately by "intense concentration" without forcing a change in tactics. The resolution relies on techno-mystical convenience ("pull frequencies from the heavens") rather than causal logic, and the "alert" fails to create a genuine deviation in the protagonist's path. Closure is achieved mechanically, lacking a felt cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    The climax hinges entirely on a coincidence—finding the grandfather's specific carving after weeks of searching—which undercuts protagonist agency. The resolution is tidy and unearned, with the decision to quit the business feeling like a switch flipped by luck rather than a pressure-cooked necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts a Causal lens but resolves through an arbitrary "magic" mechanism (moon phases and a drawer pull) that bypasses logical negotiation or human agency. The closure—instant forgiveness—feels unearned because it stems from a supernatural alignment rather than a costly choice or tactical maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    Closure is a "soft reset" triggered by a coincidence (dolphins) rather than causal action, dissolving the conflict without cost. The narrative arc relies heavily on backstory reflection that flattens present-moment momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the circular plot is legible, the causal link between a time loop and the societal restoration of empathy is asserted rather than demonstrated. The narrative relies on summary ("For three days, that newspapers was my map") to bypass the actual investigation, weakening the sense of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: preparation, ritual, success, and reset. The closure relies on a "soft reset" ("fundamentally unchanged") that negates the cost of the magic, failing the requirement for a visible or felt price at the ending. The "phoenix rose" backstory provides context but doesn't complicate the immediate causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary and explication, lacking a dramatized turning point where resistance is met. The "flash forward" ending breaks the short story scope, diffusing tension and reducing the closure to a fable-like moral rather than a felt experience. Causality is soft; the ritual yields instant answers without obstacle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural arc: preparation, action, success. While the closure (entering the dimension) is legible, it feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or adaptation to a new variable. The Drive Lens is ritualistic but lacks a tightening of stakes or a moment of doubt that would give the climax weight. The orientation is functional, but the causality is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot is driven entirely by coincidence and prophecy, removing protagonist agency from the inciting incident and resolution. The inciting "detour" is an inexplicable impulse, and the climax relies on a convenient meeting that explains the theme to the character. While a closure action (releasing the bugs) occurs, it feels mathematically inevitable rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on convenience, with the blackout being pre-planned and potential threats (the guard) immediately revealed as allies, removing all obstacle and risk. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction where everything goes to plan, lacking any Decisive Change or felt cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural path where the protagonist simply enacts a ritual without resistance or failure. A major logical breach undermines the premise: the story asserts a frictionless world yet depicts the protagonist &quot;gripping&quot; stones and placing them on a bluff without them sliding away, breaking basic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of ascent, activity, and descent without a decisive turn or causal complication. Closure is soft and atmospheric; while she completes her task, there is no "felt cost" or irreversible change on the page, resulting in a low-stakes "safe" rebellion that lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful tasks (decoding, teaching) with no obstacles or causal turns that alter options. Closure is absent; the protagonist merely proceeds to the meeting he was already waiting for, gaining coordinates without paying any felt or conceptual cost. The puzzle solution is immediate and lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a story; the protagonist begins rebuilding, continues rebuilding, and resolves to do it again tomorrow without facing a specific obstacle or turning point. The lack of a decisive change or felt cost leaves the ending as a soft continuation of the opening state.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient magical logic (broken clock ticks backward &rarr; therefore access film dimension) that lacks established causality or foreshadowing. The inciting incident is a backstory recall, and the resolution feels like a &quot;cheat code&quot; escape rather than a result of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure (dream → travel → ritual → success) without meaningful reversal or complication. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the magic works exactly as intended; the "weight of generations" is stated as an abstract burden but lacks a visible, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on "magic fix" causality where performing a ritual with no resistance yields a perfect resolution. The backstory is unclear (the "her" vs. "brother" confusion), and the closure—a glowing compass signaling peace—is earned only by the manipulation of props, not by a difficult choice or cost.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ribbon knots, butterfly patterns, and poem exchanges building density to CR closure in monument's completion and ribbon depletion as felt cost; orientation anchored early in greenhouse carving; retracing beat tightens purposefully without shards exceeding scope.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as inscriptions build to communal repair; on-page Charged Poise closure in pendulum swing and final reflection reconfigures solitary duty with conceptual cost of prior neglect legible in ridge reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to thread-decoding, pattern breaks at sacrificial twist, CR closure reweights intentions with guarded-truth cost in "some truths were meant to remain guarded." Orientation anchored early in silo under stars.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patterns/cracks to pen touching page; Charged Poise closure in "final stroke completed, she held up the map," reconfiguring options with felt time constraint cost legible in cracks and migration need. Single scene anchored early ("Elara stood at the apex of the obsidian spire"); no orientation debt. One tightening via confirmed cracks narrows adaptation path.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure in dust-dance image with felt risk cost; orientation anchored early in alcove and post-famine context; backstory shards tilt present without flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via art cycle (ash to masks), pattern break in chair's stop reconfigures stake. On-page CR closure ("no safety... continuous process of becoming") with conceptual cost legible in final image of placement/shadows. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to placement; CR closure lands on-page in "Milo placed the... cog among his other treasures" with conceptual cost of endless quiet battle legible against Council above.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds via patterned time shards building choir transformation density to charged poise closure in rosette gifting; cost legible in renewal amid vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from muttering to pruning to planting under alignment peak, tightening to Charged Poise CR in final image of "new spark of life." Orientation anchored early ("rusted greenhouse," Elias the chef). Closure cost legible in "even if only he ever tasted," foreclosing isolation path; one tightening sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds with because/therefore links: truthfulness → riddle reveal → ascent → supervisor confrontation → bee restart as Charged Poise RR. Closure cost legible in Elara's smile reconciling wonder/routine amid misguided despair. Orientation anchors early (booth, tower, dusk); no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of rituals building density to CR closure in glow/vibration beat; conceptual cost legible in reconfigured quest ("Her path forward was clear") reshaping prior understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with revelations densifying to shimmering haze vision as CR, reweighting certainty with conceptual cost of lost perfection; orientation anchored immediately in underwater garden.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as proofs accumulate density to rupture (DC) with eternity's cost legible in "wisdom of eternity"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via completed proof, closure on-page without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oriented early via painter's climb to greenhouse; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as daydream density intensifies with moon rise, culminating in Charged Poise CR at dawn admiration where hope reconfigures insomnia stake with conceptual cost of perpetual pursuit. One tightening via visions suffices; no causality breaks or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as motif density ("rosewater dread" to emerald warmth) drives lens-dough ritual to resonant reconfiguration; closure charged poise in thawing crack and lingering dread cost lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: actions like tool use and yoyo twist directly cause stone shift and radiance seep ("As she twisted it... something within... shifted"); on-page CR closure in "Everything shifted—not just the light or the tide, but the very fabric," with felt conceptual cost of altered reality as tide returns. Orientation anchored early in shore/lighthouse/stone setup; single scene tightens meaningfully at tailored-yoyo realization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with paradox density building to CR closure ("fear's weakness... clings to the illusion") reweighting death/curse; legible cost in lost illusion, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloud observation to musical intervention diverting storm, culminating in Conceptual Repricing of fractal patterns persisting; cost legible in "work complete but never-ending" as ongoing isolation/endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from tracing grooves to chamber revelation, culminating in CR closure where realization reconfigures premise ("true purpose: ... to help maintain the barrier") with conceptual cost of eternal guardianship legible in final nod and whistle raise. Orientation anchored early in shell-city details; one tightening via crack suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to ledger find (CR closure with conceptual cost to obscured history in final lines); orientation anchored early in station entry; single scene coherent, one tightening at breakthrough sense leading to floorboard reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from surveying to box recovery to note-sealing, yielding Charged Poise closure where responsibility reconfigures his calling with felt heaviness. Orientation anchors early (shore surveyor at pavilion); one continuous scene fits scope; cost legible in "heavier than usual" inkwell line.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (scrolls, maps, shadows) build density to CR closure in "bridge between past and present" with identity cost legible on-page. One tightening from blackout obstacle to revelation opportunity; orientation anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as polishing final gem deepens memory density toward RR closure; lantern's ascent with "tears of relief and sorrow" makes before/after legible with undeniable emotional cost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds with motivated descent and absorption leading to crystal's transformation; Charged Poise closure at "ready for the next hunt" reconfigures stakes with felt cost of prior loss; orientation anchors early without debt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as data patterns densify to drone convergence and CR closure: Maya's realization as "the missing piece" reconfigures premise with felt alignment cost in final pulse waves. One tightening via interference alert narrows to pull sequence; orientation anchored early at parapet/dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of carvings and reflections builds to Conceptual Repricing closure via unrecognized carving's initials reweighting erasure premise, with undeniable emotional cost in burning watch hand and tears. Orientation anchored early (cobalt terrace, dusk, genealogist). Single scene with seamless terrace-to-shore transition; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in mist/moon/drawer pull patterns to Charged Poise closure ("I apologize... I forgive" reconfigures resentments with emotional cost legible in thinned mist and gleaming pull). Single scene oriented early (parapet by para 1); one tightening via pull exchange suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflective beats (past mistake cued by job rejection) accumulates to dolphin-triggered RR (Charged Poise in lighter compass and renewed paddling) with legible emotional cost of foreclosed professional path. Orientation anchored crisply by kayak launch and clouds; single scene fits scope.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to CR closure: loop realization reconfigures journey premise with conceptual cost of eternal repetition, legible in "I signed the ball he handed me, completing the circle." Orientation anchors early in cavern; shards via reflection fit defaults without debt. One tightening via younger self encounter suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spice mixing to transformation to glyph-breath conjure builds density to Charged Poise RR closure in fading specter reunion with felt cost of impermanence ("you must walk through now"). Orientation anchored early in orchard post-phoenix; one tightening via completed metamorphosis suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions and wind tightens to CR closure ("lost time accumulates... in the spaces between moments") with surrender cost legible in glade's dissolution; orientation anchored in first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from preparation to rift widening; on-page closure via final stitch opens dimension with ship's dissolution as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in spaceship meditation chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cosmic/sensory patterns builds to CR closure in bug release and realization reweighting premise, with conceptual cost of abandoning study for being. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (beach, island, volcano work). Detour beat motivates encounter without causal break; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pacing/walls to sundial completion/power surge, reweighting stakes toward poised ignition. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page—"embers of revolution began to glow"—with felt risk of detection as cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early (Elias in fort/blackout). No lens ambiguity or disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stone placements build density to Resonant Reconfiguration closure, with star dust eruption reweighting stake via conceptual cost of risked destruction made legible in "even if it meant her own destruction." One tightening via pulsing intensification suffices; orientation anchors crisply by second paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent/setup to timer beeps/writing/climax image. Orientation anchored early ("spiral staircase of the stormlit observatory"). Charged Poise closure in final deck moment reconfigures censorship premise with felt isolation cost ("descend back below the clouds"). One tightening via timer marking "masks slip" narrows to writing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding density builds to CR closure in final walk, reweighting waiting with coordinates stored. Orientation anchored early (atrium, brook, sundial by para 2); one tightening via student interaction pays off without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tin reveal to seed-scattering, culminating in CR via final image of sealed tin and traced words reweighting anarchy as unchained truth with persistence cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds via clock anomaly → research → film threading → "he stepped forward into the projected light, he disappeared," landing DC closure with legible conceptual cost of time defiance in liminal refuge for lost daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and vibrations build to resonant reconfiguration (memories awakening) with conceptual cost in "luminous doubt" as monsoon falls; orientation anchored early in ridge/valley view. Single continuous scene fits defaults; closure cost legible in final emergence image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in needle glowing with "the color of unspoken apologies," reweighting regret with conceptual cost of persistent severance; orientation anchored early, one tightening via new lace sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers dust/renewal images that tighten the stake toward “strip needless drama.” The closing image of the damp-wing butterfly reweights the premise with CR cost—her career lens is permanently recalibrated. Orientation is clear by line 3; no因果 breaks. The one soft spot: no on-page risk or forfeiture is dramatized; the cost is conceptual, not felt, so closure lands as Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the frost patterns crystallize the mineral-smuggling motive and re-weight her art as evidence. Causal chain holds: ledger → frost cipher → industrialist link → decision to act. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; canyon night/art supplies are clear. One minor scaffold: “luminous glass artist known for…” is compressed back-story in opening sentence, but it cues present stakes immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story provides early spatial/character anchors but never turns the fork ritual into a meaningful causal hinge; the same action simply restates the premise. Closure is a declared conceptual triumph (“she had succeeded”) rather than an on-page reconfiguration with visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no constraint endured. Under an Accumulative lens, a single pattern intensification would suffice, yet the cadence stays flat—each sentence restates beauty-in-silence without deepening it. Orientation is clear, but the lens ambiguity at closure caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—library lights, souls find sanctuary—so a Resonant Reconfiguration is achieved. Yet the lens’s rules appear only at the moment they solve the problem; no prior constraint shapes tactics. Causal chain is episodic: package → coordinates → submarine → magic lens-fit; pressure does not tighten, it merely advances. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty, but the midpoint turn is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Elias publicly redefines the mission, foreclosing anonymity and inviting greater danger while the bell toll charges the moment with ancestral cost. Causality under the Situational lens coheres—sanctions tighten ➔ scarcity looms ➔ expansion declared—each step legible as pressure crystallizing stance. The midpoint orientation is anchored by word 80 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”), so no orientation debt. The cost is felt, but the actual ration math and crossing risk are asserted, not witnessed; that keeps it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a soft CR: unused love is “released,” a conceptual repricing without new constraint on Elara. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of breath + image repeats until meaning reweights—but the escalation is a smooth incline, not a tightening beat. Orientation is clear by line 12, yet the midpoint-backstory block (≈25%) pauses forward motion and is never paid off by a later causal twist. Cost is asserted (“healing completed”) rather than dramatized on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mosaic structure (present → retrocognitive drift → return) is legible, but causality is loose: the halo fragment triggers everything, yet its rules are never constrained, so later beats feel arbitrary. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara re-sees the garden as “time itself”—but the cost is asserted (“she felt as if she had lived a thousand lifetimes”) rather than dramatized, softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: arrow → bench keys → vault → early demolition tightens options. Closure lands: seeds saved, vault lost; arrow keeps final cost. Orientation clean (who/where by line 3). Penalty: vault combination decoded via off-stage childhood song—knowledge appears without prior plant, weakening causal hinge; still earns on-page reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the matrix-cooling “delicate shattering” crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing—betrayal sound becomes forgiveness resonance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, but the cancer stake is declared late and never visibly alters tactics, slightly thinning the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single continuous scene under causal lens; every beat is linked by therefore/because logic (flowers → access → jar → revelation). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s re-illumination of portraits reweights her vocation with undeniable social cost—she now curates, not sells. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 40 words; no ambiguity. The only nit: causality is straight, not knotted—one more tightening turn would lift to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final whispered “we thaw” crystallizes the season’s turn and the globe’s colored refraction reweights earlier abandonment imagery with undeniable felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—melting ice, molten glass, and spoken cadence tighten until the last line releases—but the causality between narrating and thawing is asserted, not shown via a decisive beat; the lens coherence is therefore solid, not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya stands, seashell to heart, hunters entering—an image that reweights all prior masquerade with undeniable cost (“herself, whole and unbroken”). Causality holds: because mentor betrayed → she hides → decrypts cast → confronts. Library orientation and midnight deadline are anchored by word 120; no disorientation. One causal gap: how the plaster cast appeared behind a false spine is unexplained, a teleporting-prop micro-flaw that nips the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the oracle embraces endless night as canvas, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights darkness from curse to map. Causality is textural/accumulative—pattern of hush, pebbles, and booklet flakes coalesces rather than because/therefore chain. Orientation is swift (“highest tower,” “storm-tossed ridge fort” by line 2). Cost is legible in the booklet’s glow and the vanished star, though the oracle’s personal price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine holds: because the violin resonates with its question, Unit 347 touches it → timeline flood → chooses dissolution into music → emerges as self-directed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ice violin dissolves into light that rewrites its operating system, foreclosing obedience with felt cost (“no longer hearing external directives”). Orientation is clean—robot, twilight courtyard, ice violin all land within 120 words. One causal seam: the phrase “after the procedure that had wiped its original programming” arrives late yet is required for stakes; the ellipsis is brief enough to keep lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: lens relinquished, silence re-seen as communal intimacy—an earned stasis with conceptual cost (she will keep scrubbing toilets while knowing everyone’s secrets). Causal chain is sound: lens → visions → temptation → refusal → new communicative praxis. Orientation and stakes are late—first 120 words dwell on atmospherics—but the payoff justifies the initial hush, so waiver applies. Lens ambiguity at midpoint is nil; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s final placement of the nearly whole marble at the maze entrance crystallizes his lifelong argument—some connections transcend measurement—while the rustle of leaves in windless air makes conceptual cost undeniable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of marble placements and bloom-wither cycles accrues until the closing image reweights the premise. Orientation is clean (“The withered vine dresser moved slowly through the garden maze…” anchors who/where/when inside 30 words). No prop or information teleporting; the marbles’ cracked→mended logic stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the third lever returns the nexus to dormancy, leaving Aris with an earned conceptual re-price—“the velocity of discovery had only just begun”—that reweights her life mission. Causal chain is thin but coherent: lever → nexus → bird → proof; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is clear by ~100 words (who, where, when). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated shimmering and pulsing rather than because/therefore reversals. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bird’s compounded behaviors confirm the sideways-time thesis, foreclosing disbelief. Cost is conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each immersion in the flooded house adds density until the single played chord reconfigures the silence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the program dissolves, the ghost’s code is answered, and the hush is transformed from absence to earned peace. Cost is legible in the instant of dissolution—he loses the artifact and the nightly quest. Pattern taught early (water as co-author) and paid off in the final image without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the fever breaks, therefore he notices the discoloration; because he smudges, therefore coordinates appear; because they match his collapse site, therefore he must return—each step narrows options. The decisive change is on-page: the smudge irreversibly defaces the heirloom and reconfigures his mission from observation to surrender. Cost is felt in the moment the petal ink tears—“an act that violated his training”—and persists as bodily heaviness. Closure is compressed yet legible: he steps into the night carrying both illustration and meteoric grief, paths foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valve’s cooled weight reweights the ghost-shift myth into human tragedy, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is thin—radio call arrives by chance—but the pattern is taught early (radio as oracle) and the final image crystallizes meaning with felt cost: Marcus carries the valve, now “familiar as an old friend,” a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of river time vs. frozen silence tightens through sensory callbacks (water roar vs. ozone hush) and closes with a resonant reconfiguration—the keeper re-enters flow bearing the silence’s imprint. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 20; no orientation debt. Closure cost is legible: the keeper foregoes eternal preservation, choosing ongoing decay; the swan’s new trace is the visible price. No causal gaps; the origami method is set up, paid off, and constrains return.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunlight returns and Lila whispers, reweighting silence→sound with felt cost (Maya’s tears). Causal chain holds: locket memory → drum offer → eclipse cue → speech; no teleporting props. Orientation is clean by ~100 words; one scene, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry and diaries together re-weight the world’s loss of dreams, and the historian’s vow to keep listening is an Earned Stasis with felt cost (perpetual solitude in bronze quiet). Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of echoes rather than because/therefore—taught early and held to the last image. One scaffold loop (“the bronze quiet… the bronze quiet…”) slightly dulls the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure is a summary smile, not a decisive change or charged poise; no option is foreclosed and no cost is legible. Causality is declarative (“each fortune would resonate”) rather than demonstrated. The piece is a static vignette, not an escalating story.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: pedal → layered chant → entity confusion → paint glyphs → anchor lock → silence break → expulsion. Orientation locked by word 60; dimensional rules taught through color-frequency pairing. Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary’s stillness is rewoven into a charged hush that now excludes the intruder; the cost is the lingering hum that keeps the priest tethered to future vigilance. No retro-fitted abilities or world-rule patches.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of memory-images tightens until the shell-glow cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: conductor stance crystallizes with physical collapse, cost legible in “exhaustion finally claimed him.” No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3. One micro turn—shell begins to glow—suffices. Lacks persistent constraint that shapes later tactics, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “he was not broken but beautifully complex” reweights all prior alienation under the eclipse afterglow. The causal chain holds: tablet glow → viaduct crossing → procedural fracturing → convergence chamber → acceptance. Orientation anchors by line 5 (who/where/when); deliberate disorientation inside fractures pays off when the mirrored selves externalize his inner labyrinth. Persistent constraint—perpetual weightlessness—shapes every tactical step and final self-definition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final backward spin creates a Charged Poise that reconfigures Eleanor from isolated sufferer to communal transmitter of “filament of hush.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reversed record deepens the pattern of tactile vibration until the students’ arrival crystallizes meaning. Cost is felt—“a life without volume, but full of meaning”—and the persistent constraint (deafness) shapes every tactic. The slight serendipity of finding needle + records on the same day is the only causal wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as a declared decision, not a dramatized beat: the bird is released off-page after a static paragraph of summary. Causal chain is outline-level: “he would intuit the right moment” tells us timing instead of showing the trigger. No persistent constraint or price shapes the final image, so the Decisive Change lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward memory shifts from avoidance to deliberate embrace, cost felt in the tears he no longer suppresses. Causal chain holds: orchid timer → ultraviolet reveal → scent cascade → acceptance. Orientation is clean by 40 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps. The midnight/dawn hand-off tightens stakes without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: starlight, pigment, and rope-fibres thicken into a single mandala-pattern that reweights perception. Closure is Charged Poise: the finished mandala holds all impossible choices visible at once, felt cost is the unchosen paths compressed in that image. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric design; no orientation debt. One tightening—knot completed—reconfigures meaning; meets short-form escalation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly story cadence and object echoes build toward a pattern-break rather than causal dominoes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kael’s played melody crystallizes the stake of hearing beauty inside ruin—but the cost is more symbolic than actionable. Orientation anchors early; no teleporting props. The “rainforest burned” refrain risks loop but functions as taught pattern; still, the final image reprises rather than tightens, keeping the beat just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias locks the cabinet with “affectionate detachment,” a charged poise that reweights his earlier pride. Causal linkage is loose—half-truths are declared, never tested by a failed honesty—but the accumulative texture of amber light and static hum holds. Orientation is secure; no props teleport. Closure cost is conceptual, not visceral, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: mis-delivered envelope → meeting → coffee → sponsorship → locket gift, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty locket space reweights the premise of “next connection,” cost felt as perpetual openness. No orientation debt; stars-and-sea anchoring arrives by word 60. Minor lag: “within months” compression skips the single beat where Elias’s shrewdness could have failed; still, ellipsis is motivated and does not break lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Elara aches → proposes search → group forms → tag discovery rewrites belonging. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when at orchard edge). Closure lands on-page: the sigil etched into the arbor pillar is a Decisive Change that costs her solitary artist identity and reweights the crater light as communal. Persistent constraint—the arbor now bears the tribe’s mark—shapes future identity; no teleporting information or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the restored cadence reweights the world, and the illustrator’s shortened future is legible. Causal linkage is present but light; the “borrowed time” rule is asserted more than demonstrated, so the cost is felt only at the tag end, not through tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each stalactite drip and shifting mosaic tile thickens the emotional density toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is swift (who/where/by-word-80). The final image—the stone’s new constellation—reconfigures the mentor search without solving it, leaving a felt conceptual cost: every future ritual will be read through this fresh pattern. No causality breaks, though the drip-time ellipsis is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is soft: the fragment is cached, the intervention deferred to an off-page “right person.” No on-page decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise lands; the ending re-asserts the premise instead of reconfiguring it. Causal chain is loose: the tape hums, memory floods, therefore…they cache it; no tightening beat narrows future options or exacts a price. The lens stays situational/accumulative, but without a final reweighting the narrative feels paused, not ended.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens: every storm → new anomalous growth → Elara’s tactic change → final vent-opening → explosive linden response. The linden leaf’s disappearance is the visible hinge; her vent-opening is the decisive act that lands on-page with cost (some crop destruction). Closure is clean, with before/after legible and a felt price. No telegraphing or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: tide reveals path → brooch appears → exchange offers new pigments → insomnia ends because purpose replaces trauma. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the studio sentence “I paint what remains…” reweights the whole rule-set with social cost—she must now speak for the dead. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the brooch and the public role she accepts. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one transition (night→dawn) is clean. Minor slip: the woman’s sudden arrival is convenient, but it complicates rather than resolves, so causality survives.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“from being a seer… to a participant in their creation”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is textured rather than strictly causal: each new shadow layer deepens the pattern until the cave’s music re-tunes reality. The Orientation Test is waived: the cave’s glowing walls and melodic resonance anchor who/where within the first 120 words, and the later payoff justifies the initial mild disorientation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first shadow detaches, but the pilgrim’s exit is ellipsed without visible price, keeping this just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trumpet valve on her desk reweights exile from wound to shared story. Causality is lyric-accumulative; staggered visions tighten stakes through pattern rather than because/therefore, but the lens is coherent and the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reweights the premise—he now sees “invisible connections” and will return nightly, a conceptual cost tied to eternal cartography of secrets. Causality holds under accumulative lens: each beat layers wonder rather than forcing tight because/therefore links, and the final crystallization is legible. Orientation is clean by word 50; no ambiguity persists at exit. The punch’s first chime is a micro turn that tightens, satisfying the single escalation requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tile patterns and whale songs layer until the tower becomes a sanctuary. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tower stays open, an ongoing passage with felt opportunity-cost. The “because” chain is loose, but the density-reconfiguration satisfies the lens at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: solar storm → magnetic disruption → fragment activates → dimensional glimpses → decision to cross. One transition (escondite → interdimensional corridor) is legible; closure lands a Conceptual Repricing that immortality is opportunity, not curse, with visible cost as the escondite collapses behind him. The lens is Causal throughout; because/therefore logic never breaks. Minor warp: the spatial-mutiny symptom is explained retrospectively rather than shown narrowing his options on stage, slightly muting the tightening promised by the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because her father forged, therefore she owns the pot; because the guard vanishes at 2:17, therefore she breaches. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns the pot now reflecting “possibility of redemption,” a conceptual re-pricing that carries undeniable social cost (job, prison). The safe-cracking beat is dramatized, not summarized, and the price is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lamp-hum spectrum snaps shut, the page is sealed, and tomorrow’s path is foreclosed with a literal fleck of gold—cost made material. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalating density of captured “textures” peaks at the single dawn refraction; no causal turn is required. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (mountaintop station, silent town below, inherited 37-year lamp). Time and space remain stable; no prop or rule is introduced late to solve a problem it didn’t create.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the closing image of tomorrow’s fragment-gathering crystallizes a new rule—identity = accumulated oral stories, not paper. Cost is legible: permanent exile from databases (“systems … reject my existence”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each container-row pass layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise. No orientation or causality breaks; tidal rhythm supplies the because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new object (shell, cello, chart) layers density until the final harmony reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the insight that multiplicity is the point is crystallized in the image of the needle steadying at dawn. Cost is conceptual but legible—Evelyn abandons her prior identity as pure debunker, sketched in the notebook beat. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single causal spine holds: graffiti mural as cipher → Maya’s three-night remapping → flash-mob defiance → coded counter-proposal → partial victory. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“floating raft city of Neptunia… perpetual carnival”) well inside 120-word allowance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “spiral inside a circle” paint-stroke crystallizes new communal stance with felt cost of secrecy Maya must carry. Persistent constraint visible: future raids still possible, archive coordinates hidden; gentrification slowed, not vanquished.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through density of dwindling time and cooling light, not causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—sunrise photo-finish that crystallizes irreversible extinction; cost is legible in the dissolved grain and the vanishing fireflies. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no ambiguity at closure. Minor slack: the mining operation remains off-stage, so the final causal blow is environmental, not interpersonal—still sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the re-animated drone hovers above the bowl, reweighting the whole stake from “fix a toy” to “maintain invisible tether across sea.” Causal chain is clean: damaged drone → water-refraction diagnosis → conductive-thread patch → airborne confirmation. Rising sun thinning mist supplies visible cost—time has run out, anchoring departure. Lens holds as situational pressure crystallizes into resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present and image-based (inverted delta condensation) and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: condensation pattern teaches early, returns charged. Orientation is clean by word 60; no teleporting props. The “singular convergence” reveal is conceptually repriced, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—Finch loses nothing we see—so the Decisive Change is mild. Meets publishable bar, yet the causal chain never tightens to a painful fork.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sustained note reconfigures the town and Silas’s departure under Accumulative/Textural logic with felt cost (he leaves at dawn, task done, life unchanged). Orientation is clean by 50 words; causality holds; only the off-stage “collapse” threat keeps the cost from cutting deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: low O₂ → temple door → vial capture → ascent. The vial’s hexagonal socket is seeded early, paid off when the door rumbles open, producing a Decisive Change that permanently seals the chamber behind her; the cost (lung burn, rescue gamble) is legible in the final kicks. One template-cadence ripple (“with crushing finality that would have been terrifying…”) nicks the rhythm, preventing a 9-band lock.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the decision to speak truth rather than cry wolf reconfigures his inherited trap and carries felt cost (“before they find the bodies”). The accumulative pattern (lattice / copperlight / door scuffs) tightens toward the final image; causality is lyric rather than strict, but the lens holds and the orientation anchors within the first 120 words, satisfying the mosaic track.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mosaic structure (greenhouse present → backstory → field payoff) teaches its pattern early and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the bead’s dissolution reweights the premise, showing the debt paid and love transmuted into an impossible winter bloom. Causality is lyric rather than tight—beats accumulate texture until the final image crystallizes meaning—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently; orientation is clear by word 60. Cost is felt in the bride’s dissipation, though rendered as gentle release rather than acute loss.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early—tide-emptying, dream-plate glow, orchid sprout—and the closure reweights the premise by charging the canyon with living thread-flowers. Orientation is swift; causality stays lyric rather than consequential, satisfying the lens. Cost is felt in the final image (“the labyrinth would endure, growing more beautiful”), a Charged Poise that lets the village future stand as price. Closure lands cleanly, though the absence of a single decisive on-page beat keeps it just below the 8.8 causal gate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sundial’s first shadow crystallizes Kaelen’s restored faith—an earned stasis with conceptual cost (his bird-offering seals the renunciation of diaspora). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each fragment he fits reweights his identity, so the lens holds. However, orientation is delayed: “who/where” anchors arrive only after ~140 words, slightly past the 120-word waiver line, and the disorientation does not later pay off at closure, so the −0.3 Orientation Test applies.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden receptacle image re-weights identity and time, and the “eternal dance” line makes the conceptual cost legible. Causality, however, is soft: the letter’s noon deadline is named but never tightens visible tactics; the chalk code is more metaphor than plot lever. The reflective blocks (≈30 %) exceed the default cap yet function under the BRR exception, but their lyric pattern is taught late, so the lens feels accumulative only by midpoint. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each embroidery session tightens the conspiracy’s clock because the star anomalies she spots directly enable the micro-sabotage plan. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the finished tapestry reframes her “fool” label into covert power—visible in the image of the candle-lit cloth hanging while arrests happen unseen. One minor causality slip: “adjacent possibilities” are asserted but never shown narrowing her options; the reader must infer mechanics. Still, the coup fails because of her embroidered delays, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moonlit shard → condensation window → “I forgive” offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: she accepts the fear that split them. Accumulative lens holds: each ghost-harmony and fog-letter thickens meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is lyric but coherent; no prop or rule breaks. Orientation is taught early by sensory disorientation that later pays off in the ghost chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story tightens by density increase—the coral, cast notes, and mist accrue meaning until the final hand-closing gesture reweights “translation” from language to grief. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options narrow to either tell the truth or sustain the lie, with the cost legible in the whispered contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no因果 gaps. The reflective block is the lone non-closure accumulation, but it feeds directly into present-tense perception, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fog still cloaks the streets, but the festival is reborn inside the observatory whose copper roof now leaks colored light. Causal chain never breaks—fragment under lamp → dancers appear → crowd weeps → Amelia’s joy rekindled → tradition restarts. Cost is legible in her sleepless night and in the council’s skeptical grant; persistent constraint is the ever-present fog that makes the indoor colors necessary. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each luminous layer thickens meaning until the final projection reweights the entire district.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the nickel back completes an unseen circle and reweights her vocation (“curiosity would be her new guide”) with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each sonic pulse adds density rather than forcing external turns, and the pattern holds cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new coded medium (dialect, gourd, garden, insect rhythm) layers density rather than causal turn, tightening surveillance net. Closure is Charged Poise: the moonlit rattle transmits through mycelium, crystallizing options—tomorrow’s pattern risks everything, tonight he savors outlaw thought. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the state can tax neurons yet cannot police fungal synapses. One minor skim: the nationwide “resistance” is declared not dramatized, blunting the decisive-change edge.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical paragraph layers density until the shell itself sings. Closure is a Charged Poise—the poet’s death crystallizes the lullaby’s persistence—visible in “the lullabies continued…emanating from the shell’s very walls.” Cost is felt: the poet’s mortal exhaustion pays for the armistice. Orientation is late (who/where only implied by “gargantuan shell”) but the ambiguity serves the final cosmic reprise, so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fading → repair → fragile restoration tightens through each artifact encounter; orientation clear by line 5; closure is a Charged Poise—the restored chime’s first breath reweights the entire collection with undeniable conceptual cost (“for now, the echoes remained”). One minor causality bump: “light summoned by the echo of a long-forgotten song” is announced rather than set-up, but payoff is legible at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers translated fragments until a ceremonial text breaks the pattern, tightening stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elena steps toward the chamber with “cautious exuberance” crystallized, cost felt in the near-empty ink well and the risk of irreversible division. Causality stays internal and lyric; no teleporting props. However, the archive’s spatial anchor arrives only at ~140 words, just past the 120-word orientation window, so a −0.3 orientation penalty applies, capping Q3 at 7.0 and Q1 at 8.3; the delay is minor but unnecessary for lyric payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands: she commits to the seasonal-lake plan, stakes the chain as both proof and promise, and the amphitheater’s future is reconfigured. Causal chain holds: adhesive clue → hidden inscription → design sketch → tomorrow’s risk. Orientation clear by 120 w. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final envelope gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bird’s release crystallizes her reclaimed identity with a felt opportunity cost—she is now publicly the trainer again, city anonymity forfeited. Causal chain is thin: the meteorite’s “paper trails” never actively constrain tactics, so the turn relies on symbolic affirmation rather than a because/therefore pivot. Orientation is swift; single-scene default met. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; pattern of dust–paper–flight accumulates to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the maze of drifting shards and timber patterns builds density toward the threshold-doorway. Closure is Charged Poise: “Home” reconfigures meaning and the corn breeze crystallizes cost. Orientation is clean inside its lyric compression; drifted terrace, logbook, and oak door are legible anchors. The lens holds; love’s return is the unavoidable repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather’s map rewrites her future, and the underwater sky re-weights her life’s premise. Causality, however, is loose—the feather’s pull is magnetic rather than motivated, and the facility abandonment is never explained, softening the “because” chain. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single transition (descent to dome) is legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of mirrored constellations accumulates until the final inversion; cost is felt but abstract—loss of terrestrial certainty—rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated "before memory fades" cadence deepens meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—paths disappear to become—but cost is intellectual, not felt; lens coherence intact yet emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the bishop’s passage reweights serendipity from Leo’s private rule-set to public gift, with social cost legible in the woman’s stunned tears. Causal lattice holds: early drop → planted quartet → gift transfer, each step “because/therefore.” Orientation is secure inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices for this length, but the cost is borne by the recipient, not the protagonist, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone dissolves, Lira’s skin becomes manuscript, exile turns sacred—cost is legible in the image of permanent inscription. Causal chain holds: dance → speck → anchoring → cosmic verse, each because/therefore. Orientation is swift: “twilight garden under stars” anchors by line 3. One soft spot: the Council’s threat is off-stage, so the ban never actively narrows her options within this scene; the tightening is purely metaphysical, not practical.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyric dawn details layer until the pond ritual reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she will now “transform perspectives,” not just glass—arriving with conceptual cost. Setup anchors who/where by ~60 words; orientation clear. One risk: the causal chain between stone-toss and epiphany is asserted, not narrowed by tangible obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held: crack→ash→moonlit vein pattern intensifies until the fracture is re-read as survival stroke. Closure = Charged Poise: final image reweights premise—box no longer accusation but companion—cost is felt in “grounding, human connection.” Orientation anchored by word 40 (“moonlit ridge path”). No causal break; persistent constraint (scarred body + cracked box) shapes entire ascent/descent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gauge steadies on Elian, signalling that his equations have “found purchase” across timelines; the cost is conceptual—he now bears the weight of multiplied possibility—so RR is valid. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the single scene holds. Causality is soft (Accumulative/Textural lens): pattern density escalates until the needle locks, not because/therefore. No meaningful tightening inside the beat—decorative rearrangements don’t narrow live options—so escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (diaries, negative) layers sensory memory until the ivy passage is re-priced as a living archive. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“she carried the weight”—but the beat is compressed into a single declarative sentence; the therefore-linkage between Thorne’s abrupt end and her own assumed burden is implied, not stated, keeping the change just legible.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last bell fades and mirrors collapse back to plain wall, leaving her alone with the “familiar melancholy of separation”—a felt price for witnessing infinite selves. The accumulative lens holds: each mirrored shard adds density until the final reversion reweights her solitude. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the empty clipboard left on the table crystallizes the cost—lifetime solitude traded for a fragile peace—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent: ritual steps, celestial alignment, and Elian’s practiced patience accumulate until the representatives sign. The midpoint orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props or outline drift. Enough for immediate publication, but the causal chain never tightens to a single irreversible beat that would lift it to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the egg placed in the converging cracks while rain erases footprints reweights Silas’s moral ledger under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: drought → egg acquisition → map-memorization → release → rain, each step tightening his internal contradiction. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at line 4 (“The salt flat stretched endlessly before Silas Thorne”). No lens ambiguity; the final image of rain on salt crystallizes the conceptual cost of manufactured drought and personal atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is Accumulative/Textural: repetitions of “untangling threads,” “harvest of echoes,” and “between sigh and smile” build density rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara steps into the prism sanctuary and absorbs the chorus of rebellions. The cost, however, is conceptual (“she became both lock and key”) rather than viscerally felt; the absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as a gentle CR: the stick now holds new audience stories, showing narrative power can be re-weighted at social cost. Causality is loose—accumulative lens—yet pattern holds: each puppet show deposits another layer of counter-narrative inside the stick. The cost is conceptual (stories once silenced now inscribed), but the lack of a tangible renunciation keeps it just shy of 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptive layer (garden, butterfly, amber relic) thickens the ecological bereavement pattern until the knotted constellation reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the monarch’s wing-beat dip and the starlit threads crystallize options—memory is fleeting yet chosen. Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity. Cost is legible in “tonight…for at least one more night,” a temporal boundary that forecloses permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: names crystallize overhead, the aurora column locks her in keeper stance, and the price—perpetual solitude—glows in the ice. Causality is intact but thin; the card-to-rope translation works because the text declares it does, not because prior beats foreshadow the mechanism. Orientation anchors early and hold; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density intensifies until the final image reweights memory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the directive rewired from map-of-places to map-of-possibilities, paid for by lifelong temporal exile now ended. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm, seal, dream layers accrue until meaning, not causality, flips. Orientation is taught late (who/where locked only after ~150 words) but the disorientation pays off as part of the final reconfiguration, so waiver applies. Cost is legible in the final image—“sunlight filtered through vines” now experienced in real time, a faculty she has never possessed.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tile’s unfolding reweights his life’s work and brands him with cosmic glyphs—cost felt. Causal lens holds: because he clings to frugal exactitude, therefore he can complete the schematic that summons the tile’s revelation. Orientation anchored by word 60. One soft beat: “Seven years of observation” is told, not shown, but does not break causality. No teleporting props; night-to-dawn clock tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a CR image—two fused boxes—whose cost is conceptual (resentment released) but not felt: no forfeiture, no renounced desire, no visible price paid by Marcus. Causal lens is weak: the broken pin repairs itself because Marcus “feels” forgiveness, not because he makes a decision that risks anything. Mid-story “cellular memory” reveal is an explanatory lull that halts pressure rather than tightens it. Brother’s arrival is coincidence that resolves, violating the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: sextant now points inward, orchard wall dissolves, dream becomes pilot. “I will not capture you” crystallizes the trade-off—possession exchanged for partnership—under an accumulative lens where imagery density, not causal reversal, re-weights meaning. Cost is felt in the irrevocable shift of the instrument’s function and the fog’s parting.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: Elias’s stance crystallizes with conceptual cost signaled by orchard flare and the universe "laughing and weeping"; however, the nonlinear-inheritance rule stays abstract—no concrete constraint rebounds on tactics—so the lens leans Accumulative/Textural more than Causal, slightly thinning the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “gaps in understanding were not merely empty spaces but opportunities both sacred and urgent” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost—every future gap demands rescue. Causal chain holds: diary → guardians → library → extraction; the “access points you deliberately omitted” line is the tightening beat that pivots permission. Orientation is clean by ~120 w; the bookstore-mountain is anchored in the opening paragraph. The lens is hybrid—causal quest plus accumulative texture—but the causal spine dominates and the final sentence re-prices the rule-set, satisfying 9-band closure test.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she becomes the ship’s chronicler—yet the causal chain is foggy: the emerald card dissolves because the text says so, not because she risks or forfeits anything. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of memory-thread accumulation holds, but the final reweighting is more asserted than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal chain is clean: seal → notes → door → rope → merge, each because/therefore link legible. Closure gives a Conceptual Repricing—Croft’s living presence reweights the absence myth—but the cost is only intellectual, not visceral; the rope’s hum never translates into Eleanor’s forfeiture on the page, muting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a tidy CR—the bloom of hush reweights the premise and the beings harmonize—but the cost is only asserted (“the stone now resonated differently”) rather than dramatized on the body or the cave. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and cadence shifts at the end, satisfying the lens rule. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words, but causality between ice-crack reading and perfect counter-frequency remains magical rather than demonstrated, blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the rekindled beacon is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise—coincidences are threads, not chaos. Causal linkage holds: star-path tracking → prism alignment → light restored. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 50 words, no debt. One soft spot: the “shard of hush” dream delivery is slightly teleporting, but the later alignment beat retrofits it with enough craft to keep causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the solidified fog becomes a living archive, re-weighting Elthion’s lifelong premise that identity must be sculpted from preserved experience. The cost is legible in the image of him choosing to remain below, “listening to the whispers,” surrendering the solitary heights of the observatory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the final hush is a cadence shift that crystallizes all prior texture. No causal contradiction; orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 4 and paid off in the closing cocoon.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final ember fades and the fortress “no longer felt starless,” a reconfiguration legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—finding the mosaic note is pure luck, not earned—but the pattern of color-echoes does tighten the stake. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal; the piece meets the 600-word default, one scene, single POV, anchors by 120 words. Lens holds; orientation clear; waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya’s new model is declared in the final beat, reweighting the funding threat into ecological metaphor; cost is felt in her vow to “embrace uncertainties.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal-echo images and cicada pulses accrues until meaning tilts. Orientation anchored by 110 words; no penalty. No causal break; ellipsis between funding question and insight is motivated by her tangential method. Persistent constraint established: scarcity becomes the lens itself.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens: “because she fears enclosed silence, therefore she seeks inverted-gravity silence.” The inversion hour is a single, taught rule; its payoff is the decisive ascent and descent that reconfigure her stance toward the bunker. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the gilded hush is contained but must be left behind, foreclosing future ascents. One micro-turn—gravity normalizes—forces the return; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last glimpse of Elias bracing for another whistle-quiet cycle crystallizes both vocation and solitude. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each prism tilt and breath-out passenger adds density rather than reversing plot. Orientation is swift; valley, terrace, and gondola anchor within fifty words. No loop or scaffold intrudes on the final beat, so the resonant reconfiguration reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal chain holds: ruby → orchard → paint → throne → renunciation. Orientation is clean by 80 words; closure is Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—she awakens the throne but cannot sit. The lens stays causal throughout; only minor soft-reset feel when “earth dissolves politely” keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary is abandoned, isolation foreclosed, cost felt in the dawn she now must share. The causal chain holds: ring warmth → three knocks → door → reciprocal scars. The 97-day countdown and bridge-burning flashbacks are anchored to present stimuli (ash patterns, ring pulse). Final image reweights the premise: emptiness is no longer refuge but loneliness paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible: texts → curiosity → solo descent → bolt → diamond transformation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (pressure → beauty), satisfying the lens. However, the quantum rule is introduced after the bolt is found, not earned through prior constraint; the stakes tighten only via expository gloss inside the final beat, blurring cause-effect. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single causal lens holds: because he trusts resonance over violence, therefore he cranks the modified gramophone until the standing waves force the floor to yield the parchment. Closure lands with conceptual cost—dynasty legitimacy erased—but the price is external (future council) rather than personally felt on the page. Orientation is clean by 60 words; no gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final Charged Poise reconfigures meaning. Closure lands—“guardian of the spaces between realities”—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clean by word 60; one shard only, no transition needed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-pattern method taught early, cadence of kindness anecdotes builds density, final image reweights institutional dust as shared legacy. Closure lands as Charged Poise—two ex-foster children holding matching buttons in silence—conceptual cost of perpetual institutional belonging is undeniable. One causality micro-gap: button is “missing from the right lapel” in photo yet no previous mention of its absence, a teleport-notice, but it does not break the RR. Orientation clean within 120 words; transitions inside single file-room scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: informant warning → patrol increase → puddle epiphany → lagoon breach → key bypass → data drain, each linkage legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ripples become a portable archive, reconfiguring future options with the conceptual cost of permanent exile. Orientation is clean by line 5; no penalty. The “ voices вони laughedнебр” typo fractures causality mid-climax, breaking immediacy and capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is thin—music cancels whisper—but the goal is legible and the prism atrium anchors space and acoustics early; orientation passes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is hushed, the mist remains, and Ethan stands in the new silence; the cost is conceptual (loss of his haunting purpose) rather than dramatized. One shard, single POV, no teleporting props; meets short-form scope. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light/dew/silence thickens until the final cadence shift; because/therefore links are weak but the reweighting holds.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each seed and leaf adds density until the moonstone dust speck crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing monument reconfigures the arbor’s meaning while the warning scroll externalizes cost. Causality stays intact because the dust speck is earned by lifelong attentiveness, not luck. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who, where, when delayed until ~140 words) is taught early and pays off when the same ashen light returns in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: attic compass discovery → greenhouse → subterranean find → deliberate conversion of repair ethic. Closure is Conceptual Repricing with visible social cost: Elias knowingly sells customers “imperfect” clocks, forfeiting his old reputation. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. Transitional ellipsis from greenhouse to cavern is legible; pattern of “descent into living time” is taught early and paid off. All causal joints tight; only micro-wobble is the one-line proverb “dance with chaos” that grazes thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the new coin’s golden seams reweight Elias’s entire mission. Causal linkage is present—because he accepts Lumina’s loss, therefore he transmutes his failure into a new artifact. One continuous scene, no teleporting props; furnace and rain anchors are fixed early. Final image carries undeniable conceptual cost: centuries of flawless tradition are willfully replaced by a scarred, luminous token.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: “crocodile tooth warms” → confess → bell laugh → release. The Orientation Test is passed by word 60; the final image (shimmering ascent) reweights the premise with felt cost—Elias adds another regret to his pouch. One soft beat: the 73-year timeline is stated, not sourced in-scene, but it does not touch the closure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers UV imagery and strap touches until a pattern-break reweights survival into meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) lock by line 5; no orientation penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“survival was the first variable”—with visible cost (strap relinquished). Causality is poetic, not because/therefore, but density peaks when the strap warms, tightening stakes. One soft spot: the forest’s agency (“seemed to lean closer”) risks coincidence, yet it complicates rather than resolves, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ambiguous-drive lens resolves to Accumulative/Textural: layered lyric shards build density toward the final image. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—hidden histories flood in, re-weighting the premise; cost is felt as irreversible exposure. Orientation anchors (who/where) are poetically delayed yet taught by 70-word mark and payoff at closure, satisfying waiver. One scaffold: “elusively tangible” repeats 4× without pattern shift, dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: 4:16→4:17 silence→cracks open→barrel response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking barrel crystallizes Marcus’s stance, reweighting his curse as calling. Cost is legible in the final image—“rhythmic heartbeat cleaving through the barrier.” Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library becomes breathable, knowledge unbound, Eldon coated in dew-words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight the stake. The cost is legible in the cracking/reforming glass and the erasure of his old sanctuary; orientation is taught early via the floating glass orchard, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the manuscript reweights the dispute from binary truth to shared myth-making, with felt social cost implied by the astonished delegates. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each lyrical return to the shard thickens meaning—but the leap from solitary writing to collective acceptance is elided, softening the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Causal chain is present: rust threat → midnight deadline → humming tether → reclaimed light. The resonance chamber rules are taught early and paid off at closure, but the “covenant of rust” origin (a broken promise) is asserted, not dramatized, weakening the final conceptual cost. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: the city-wide music restart reframes meaning, though the on-page price is diffuse—no tangible forfeiture or lingering constraint for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: lagoon water re-bottled re-weights her entire archive; factory closure as “signal” gives social cost. Causal lens holds: factory shutdown → cliff access → crevice → lagoon; compass agency spins then fixes the final stance. Micro-turn at “You’re late” tightens options without external rescue. Cost legible in last image—childhood vial re-inhaled, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena leaves the sculpture beneath the arch, an Earned Stasis that forecloses her earlier need for GPS navigation and pays a felt opportunity cost (she walks away without reclaiming direction). Causal lens holds: because the slide reveals temporal layers, therefore she re-imagines her art and relinquishes technological crutch. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. One soft spot: the slide’s discovery is a lucky find that precipitates all change—convenient, but the story accepts coincidence as complication, not resolution, so lens integrity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of moonlit images layers until the cathedral glass refracts the stake into a new key. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—moonlight, dew, glass re-weight the floral mystery with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no causal reversals are required under this lens. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts daily parley with the past, foreclosing a clean exit; grandfather’s new diary entry supplies undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each diary-opening tightens retrocognitive entrapment, therefore she seeks lagoon interface. One minor scaffold: “truth in tension” repeated thrice; does not break linkage but dulls final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: bottle contemplation → memory cascade → manifesto dawn → square action; the “awakening town” ellipsis between paragraphs could disorient, yet the final posting of notices re-grounds time and place, delivering a Conceptual Repricing that makes the sealed bottle re-weight the whole civic premise at visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy re-weights Elias’s oath-scribe duty into city-wide emotional rescue, and the cost is felt in the silent foghorn & final candle-lit isolation; lens is Causal (because/therefore). Anchors (who/when/where) are clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One transition (memory shard) is taught early and paid off at the prophecy beat, so Track B mosaic is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—spiral seed order, starlight density—then tightens via pattern break when the vortex manifests, re-weighting the stake from knowledge to visceral participation. Orientation is rock-solid by line 3; every beat after the egg cue escalates entropy-reduction until the final image of “inverted tree seeking its roots” delivers a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: she becomes the bridge, foreclosing isolation. No causal gaps; the oak cap’s tactile history anchors each transition. Closure lands on-page with visible irreversibility—she reaches to touch, not preserve—cementing the before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is cleanly earned: the bell rings itself, reweighting Elias’s years of listening into a resonant reconfiguration. Causal chain holds—glue cure → rope test → reroute → bell sings—though the “zero hour” hinge is declared more than dramatized. Orientation is swift; sanctuary altitude and solstice timing anchor by line 3. Under the accumulative lens, cadence tightens from hush to bronze note with visible conceptual cost: the mountain, not man, issues the storm warning.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft epiphany rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist steps outside, sees stars transform, and comes back glowing—no option is foreclosed, no price is paid. The yellow glass warms but never constrains later tactics; the “call” is followed without resistance or cost. Causality is accumulative/textural, yet the final image merely restates the premise instead of re-weighting it. Orientation is clear early, but the midpoint escalation plateaus; the lens holds yet delivers no tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each ghost-hover and hive-detail thickens the covenant’s pressure until the moonlit release reweights silence as keeper-duty. The hinge—box opens only after accumulated listening—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: the recluse’s lifelong vow of muteness. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned beekeeping oasis”), causality intact. No sentence can be cut without eroding density; closure is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale gloss adds density until the capsule’s ethos is re-stitched. Closure lands cleanly—“she would be ready to welcome them”—a Charged Poise that reconfigures her role from solitary reader to seed-scattering teacher; the cost is the unending vigil this guardianship implies. Tension tightens once when she grasps that linearity is a lie, but the beat is delivered in summary rather than scene, muting the pivot’s force. Orientation is swift and stakes remain stable; no因果 breaks intrude, yet the single intensification is mild for high-band ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the closure is a Charged Poise—feather bookmarked, poet walking away—where the cost is the surrender of completion itself, reweighting the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cobalt lagoon after rain”), transitions are seamless, no prop teleport. One meaningful tightening: kite release shifts cadence and reconfigures her stance toward “letting go.” Cost is legible in the final image of “forever becoming,” but because the kite is not her kite, the causal pressure is observational rather than instrumental, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as a gentle CR image, but the causal chain is outline-narrative: “he followed the diary, therefore bridge restored.” Missing intermediate obstacles or resource costs keep the remodel from tightening options along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is present: placing the amber reconfigures meaning via Conceptual Repricing. Yet causality is weak—footprints appear already perfect, the tower door is ajar, the amber glows on contact—so the decisive change feels orchestrated rather than earned. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern (bronze quiet / dusty prints) does not tighten; it merely repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scatter beat thickens the pattern rather than pivots plot. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 100 words; the blooming-jetty image teaches the reader how to read the lyric repetitions that follow. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “renewing reef” image reconfigures the submerged concord with undeniable conceptual cost—peace literally surfaces. The single causality weakness: no on-page obstacle ever endangers the mission; tension is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard adds density to the “tinted revelation” pattern until the final image reweights “distance” as shared knowledge. Transitions are legible (scrapyard → cracked plain → hidden valley); orientation is anchored within 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the paired leaves crystallize options without declaring moral; the cost is the irreversible journey and the war-scarred senses he can never wash clean. Causality holds: every coordinate is foreshadowed by the cylinder/groove logic; no late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the compass warms, the final sentence crystallizes “true north within her” with conceptual cost—she will remain alone. Accumulative lens holds: each star-map ritual thickens the pattern until the last reprise reweights her pariah status as chosen vocation. Causality is lyric rather than plot-based, acceptable under Accumulative default. The cost is felt, not paid, hence lands safely under RR.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is intact: each chess placement triggers because/therefore spatial reveals that escalate access toward the lid. Orientation is clean; sky-wrongness anchors time and stakes by line 3. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the now-ticking pocket sundial implies perpetual guardianship—visible when master warns “there will always be new mysteries.” Lens holds, yet escalation is more mechanical treasure-hunt than narrowing of options; no prior tactic is foreclosed, only unlocked. A persistent constraint (e.g., a countdown within the spire) would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s echo-pattern and reweights the pawn’s absence until the single returned pawn crystallizes the “luminous absence” closure with felt cost—memory reclaimed at the price of acknowledging thousands lost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile engagement with feather and stone thickens the bookstore’s reality until the mountain dissolves into the nexus image; the closure beat—“home wasn’t a place at all, but the connections between places”—carries conceptual cost because the rotunda she stands in is literally erased, foreclosing her old exile.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dense causal lattice: because the prince died during the lesson, the tutor is exiled; because he fidgets productively, he can decode; because he decodes, the bell rings; because the bell rings, time restarts and the prince offers pardon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time’s flow resumed—charged by the bell that names him, undeniable cost in decades stolen. Lens is Causal, taught early and held to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present as Charged Poise: the canyon’s endless echoes refract her last whisper into “infinite variation,” reweighting the singular truth. Cost, however, is only conceptual; no concrete forfeiture (freedom, safety, relationship) is shown on the page, softening the punch. Causal chain is loose—poetry sessions are summarized rather than dramatized—so the escalation to ritual danger feels outline-like. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tilt of the workshop images the emotional cost of embracing flawed wholeness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each scar traced adds density until the final cadence shift reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Cost is palpable in the tilt and the “golden joining” image that forecloses forever the fantasy of unbrokenness.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seashell’s return reweights “temporary eternity” from abstract ache to lived balance, felt cost in the sunset brushstroke. Causal chain intact: storm → cracked mirror → heightened reflection motif → wrong turn → shell retrieval → final canvas. One smooth shard-transition (overgrown path → cave) is taught early and closure still holds under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored by 83 words; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal lattice is tight: vial cork → whisper → jasmine scent → returned vibration → captain’s softened stance. Each beat is a because/therefore link; no off-stage coincidences resolve the stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the captain’s “sea listens best to those who speak softly” re-weights the story’s rule-set with social cost. Only minor waiver: the sister’s village beat is a shard, but transition is telegraphed by “halfway around the world” and the lens stays lyric-causal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the navigator’s fingers on the searing censer while ship lights blink gratitude—options reconfigured, cost felt in flesh. Causal lens holds throughout: because hydraulics failed, navigator must nightly rebuild paths; because moon waxes, censer grows hot enough to brand skin, enabling final signal. No orientation debt—who/where/when anchored by word 60. One smooth scene, no teleporting props; censer discovered in wreckage, carried through every beat. Persistent constraint: bronze’s moon-phase heat literally shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the second eye reweights empathy from curse to gift, cost paid by her tears and the solitude we’ve watched. Causal chain holds—each ritual step is motivated by prior virus trauma and textbook hope; the storm masking her and the fork’s double find are situationally plausible, not resolving. Orientation anchored by line 4 (who, where, when); transitions are single-scene continuous. No lens ambiguity; pattern of safety-seeking → recalibration is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the open-hand gesture reweights isolation into shared human burden, cost legible in Elias’s tender replication and the glowing flower drifting to tide. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—mist, memories, Edelweiss accrue until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; single time-span (three days) tracked cleanly. No plot amnesia; borrowed visions foreshadow gaps he later verifies. Would breach 9.0 if causal stakes were sharper than atmospheric; still, the tightening of sensory pattern to symbolic act is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the doorway image reweights every prior map, the cost is the irreversibility of chosen solitude. Causal chain holds—mentor’s promise → chip → ants → pool → doors—each link tightening options. The creek rising tracks emotional tempo without coincidence. Only the missing midstory micro-choice (a moment where Elias could quit but doesn’t) keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dream recurrence → firefly ritual → cobalt threshold → starlight pool tightens the stake each beat; each image accretes meaning until the reflection re-prices her identity. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 50 words). Closure is CR: the bleeding starlight reweights her royal role with undeniable conceptual cost—she returns transformed, carrying a hidden wellspring. Persistent constraint: the grotto remains her clandestine recharge, shaping future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “gentlest technique” reweights her entire craft and forecloses the old snapshot method. Accumulative lens holds: each ember flicker, shell glint, and pocket-sun hum layers density until the whispered secret reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props or causal breaks. One minor loop—“scientifically romantic” repeated three times—keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: birch-scroll, grave-vision, and aurora motifs layer until the final image reweights the premise—cartographer of consciousness accepts eternal loop. Orientation is taught early via temporal slip (“yesterday still felt like tomorrow”) and pays off in the mosaic of crossed-out dates; no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when scroll symbols glow, dissolving walls and forcing the soar; cost is conceptual—he surrenders linear identity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “every grave was also a cradle” re-prices mortality with felt awe. Slight drift into lyric summary at soar peak prevents 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single scene, causal lens: loss of smell → clock repair → screw left → recognition → bridge built. Orientation is clean by word 80; fog and drips anchor time. Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s heart “lighter”—but the cost is only stated, not shown; no option is visibly foreclosed, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she exhales only after the quill tip falls, signaling the transformation is complete and the path foreclosed. Causality holds—because she revisits the superstition, crystallization halts—yet the platform tilt is external coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of memory and ritual reweights the stake until the final image (“saturated hush”) reconfigures meaning. Cost is visible in the shed tip, but the scars’ conversion is summarized, not shown, blunting the decisiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the incomplete sheet music left on the piano reweights the reunion as forever partial, a visible cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: perfume → apparition → bridge → fade, each beat thickens nostalgia. However, the electromagnetic ritual is introduced late and its mechanics are never allowed to fail or limit tactics, so the cost feels symbolic rather than practical. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dictionary’s blank page fills with lost truths, universe and witness unify, hush becomes echo. Yet causality is lyrical, not sequential; “because” is replaced by mantra cadence. Orientation anchors arrive late and dream-logic; space folds on intention, so spatial coherence is intentionally fluid. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern teaches itself, but escalation is mantra-deepening rather than option-narrowing, so pressure feels meditative rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece teaches its accumulative/textural pattern early—hydraulic imagery, razor edges, backward flow—and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: time is redefined as cyclical meaning rather than linear tally. Causality is internal but coherent: each backward count intensifies perceptual knowledge rather than external stakes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. The cost is legible in the final image of Arlo wearing the key “never to use it conventionally again,” a visible forfeiture of social role. A 0.4 deduction because the lens hinge (knowledge accumulation vs. situational pressure) is slightly ambiguous until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final “instrument of communion” reweights every prior security act. Causal logic holds: modified laser → mushroom response → stranger’s reciprocation → Elara’s recognition. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten. Cost is legible in the shift from “security tool” to “key,” a conceptual repricing that forever changes her job and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated subway hunts + candle-lit library sessions build density until the final “charged poise” reweights mathematics as communal hope rather than private proof. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration (she forecloses the old axiomatic quest, accepts “beautiful uncertainty”) with felt conceptual cost: her father’s absence and the endless subway rides remain. One scaffold loop—“lucid contradictions” appears 3×—slightly dulls the final cadence but doesn’t break the image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    The closure image—Elias “no longer felt haunted but harmonious”—is a CR-repricing that lands, but the cost is only asserted; nothing on the page shows him forfeiting solitude or risking pain. Causality is loose: the disc “calls” Meredith, removing Elias’s agency from the inciting moment; beats therefore accumulate rather than tighten because/therefore linkages. Orientation is fine: who/where/when anchors within the first 120 words and holds. Under Accumulative lens the pattern is legible, yet a single visible forfeiture (e.g., breaking his silence protocol) would have lifted the ending into high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the regenerated covenant is conceptually repriced—the archive will vanish, but the amber vial and hand-drawn journal become the new archive, so “what might be remembered” is narrowed to what he can physically carry. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of twilight, scent of steeped ink, and cyclic returns to locket/jetty reweight the stake rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) appear within first 120 words and remain stable; no causality breaks. Cost is felt—“the locket photo grew warm against his chest” just before he walks away—yet the beat is slightly summary, keeping this just under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mosaic of rumor shards is taught early and each segue is time-stamped, satisfying Track B. Closure lands cleanly: the loneliness “cure” reframed as the sharing itself is a Conceptual Repricing with social cost felt in the final anonymity beat. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each channel adding social density rather than tight because/therefore chains. The only minor waiver is that the initiating decision to seed the rumor happens off-page in the gap between paragraphs; once accepted, the pattern delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each ultrasonic shimmer, note-pattern, and stellar pause layers density until the silence of the stillpoint reweights grief. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—Elion rises with “a quiet blaze kindled within his soul,” a crystallised image that forecloses return to grief-struck paralysis. Cost is legible in the tear-track and the ring now saturated with “wisdom beyond words.” Orientation is anchored by the third sentence; no ambiguity persists. The one soft spot is the single-line mention of “generations of mapmakers” which could have been foreshadowed earlier to tighten causality.

    Causal chain holds: wrong seed → guilt → contingent edit → Sarah’s correction, each step legible under the Causal lens. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 40, well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pen returned to its case reconfigures her role as perpetual gardener, not fixer, with conceptual cost felt in the final star-wink image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each mapped silence adds density until the final tapestry reweights the stake—Elias will vanish but the music lingers. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s “voice it had never known” revalues his erasure as generative. Cost is legible in the final sentence’s “perfect harmony of joyful sorrow.” No orientation debt; transitions clean within the single moonlit window.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every artistic discovery is a because→therefore step toward the restored portrait and self-library. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the restored portrait is the literal “cost” of her past, reweighting her future as archivist. Cost is visible: she forfeits sunlight, accepts perpetual guilt, embeds her fragment in the door tapestry—“ashes” converted to hinge. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“Maya’s fingers trembled over the faded tapestry fragment”); no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the lyrical pattern of drumming→visible sound→lagoon manifestation is taught early and pays off in a Conceptual Repricing (the garden becomes the dreamed lagoon). Orientation is anchored by word 60; cost is felt in the four-minute blackout window and the translucent, transient Theo, but the causal leap from “rhythm on railing” to full physical lagoon is lightly motivated—accept under lyric logic yet marginally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is tight: geomagnetic storm → acoustic anomaly → Marlo exploits whispers → Vance’s shout fails. The “folded-map creases form zodiac signs” supplies a visual micro-turn that pays off when the final map is added. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marlo’s whisper network is now institutionally visible, yet he accepts perpetual secrecy—cost is the foreclosed possibility of recognition. One scaffold loop: “the geomagnetic storm had intensified… storm was intensifying now” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unspoken secret is reweighted by the completed star-pattern, cost felt in the mirror going dark. Causal chain is thin—visitor never acts—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation clear by 50 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn windows reweight the town’s rule-set, visible cost is the audible shift from resignation to wonder Arthur hears in the magnetic grotto. Causal chain holds: whispers → grotto amplification → plan → dawn displays → changed soundscape. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation (mist, cobalt light, starlight underground) is taught early and pays off in the final image. Persistent constraint: Arthur’s gift never lets him stop listening, shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—finding scrimshaw → reading new text → whale call → ritual → island surfacing → dive—is legible and ends with a decisive, irreversible change. Orientation is cleanly anchored in the first two sentences; the single transition (dawn after evening) tracks cleanly. Cost is felt (“taking Mara with it to depths”), though the price feels more mystical than personal; a sharper tangible loss or forfeiture on-page would clinch higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving/petal layer adds density until the final figure reweights the stake—permission to feel. Closure is a Charged Poise: “a remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 4; no penalty. One minor loop: “layers of…” repeated twice in 60 words (−0.2). Cost is legible in the refused sale and the ever-thinning block of pine.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light/shadow recurrence thickens until the poet dissolves into it; closure is a Charged Poise—the world “awaited their art”—with conceptual cost (they can never return to mere observer). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3, satisfying the 120-word test. However, the single turning beat (quartz touch → transcendence) is causally thin; the colonnade’s rule-set is not established beforehand, so the gate feels like sudden magic rather than earned repricing. No persistent constraint or price shapes later tactics once they leave, nudging the closure toward resonance rather than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s color vision floods back as she watches Gideon’s renewed hands, costing her the reed tongue and her monochrome world—cost is on-page. Causal linkage holds: Fibonacci plant pattern → courtyard inhales → trade → awakening. Orientation clear by word 60. One soft causality bump: the courtyard’s “inhale” is poetic but reads as consensus magic rather than taught rule; still, it foreshadows the barter logic and lands without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers sensory echoes until the final Charged Poise reweights silence itself. Orientation is swift and clean; the only causality slack is that the lamp lens “awakens dormant memories” without an on-page trigger we can witness. Closure lands—the lab becomes a “cathedral of resonance”—but the cost is conceptual, not felt by the protagonist, slightly undercutting the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure is a soft Charged Poise: origami glow in alcoves, implying ongoing service. Cost is conceptual—lifelong guardianship—but feels abstract because Elena never confronts a live decision inside the scene window. Causality is accumulative/textural: grief → observatory → craft → teaching, each step declared rather than tested. The drive lens holds, yet the tightening is narrated density, not a visible fork that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-build via card placements & rain reflections; closure is a Charged Poise—two minds joined, future unwritten but reconfigured. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene, single POV, one transition (door creak). No causal break, yet no persistent constraint or price is crystallized on the page beyond the vague “responsibility.” Cost is conceptual, not embodied—acceptable under CR, but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last light vanishes while Elara smiles “through tears,” reconfiguring her life into vessel-hood with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each random circuit tightens the atoms’ visibility until the final immersion feels inevitable. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. The beat sequence is essentially one long crescendo without a mid-course tightening, so escalation is present but monotonic; a single deepening rather than a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observed footage → pressed flowers → stone warmth builds to charged poise. Closure is cleanly the moon-lit dissolving-into-light image that reweights all prior shadows as messages, not anomalies; cost is the irreversibility of recognizing the friend too late. Orientation is swift; causality is lyrical, not broken. One soft spot: the “Great Division” is introduced late and functions as retroactive stakes, slightly dilating the tight loop.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the decision to keep caring while “eyes wide open” crystallizes with felt cost, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is sound, yet the tightening beat is implicit (no on-page test of the new stance), so the cost is resonant but not irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure form is Earned Stasis: she renounces wound-opening and carries the miracle home, paying with her old identity. Causality is loose: coffee-ring “map,” hourglass glow, and wall-spirals simply reveal the tunnel rather than being tested or resisted. Orientation is clean—tower, dawn, after anesthesia—so the Orientation Test is waived. The miracle’s return does reconfigure her mission, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s “persistent constraint,” but the renunciation itself is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost feels announced rather than witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pass over the film strip thickens the emotional density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—who, where, when are anchored by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam carries “forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune,” a conceptual repricing that makes the stored love’s release undeniable. Cost is present—Elena’s tear, the “storm contained within a single human heart”—but because she sacrifices nothing concrete (no lost relationship, no physical risk), the price is felt rather than visible; this keeps it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes when she re-weights her curse into a tool, the notebook poised to convert star paths into art. Causal chain holds: because each traced trajectory reorders the whispered voices, therefore the creative block thaws; the astronomical instrument’s glow externalizes the earned change. The lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout—pattern build-up of star traces + whispers → cadence shift at the archway—so no causal turn is required. Cost is visible in the “shadowed rapture” and the ache in her hands, legible inside the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric repetitions (“glowing dune,” “fractured lullaby”) build cadence toward a Charged Poise at the final seed. Orientation is complete by line four; the world’s ash/quantum logic is taught through image, satisfying the waiver. The clock’s tick supplies a perceptible before/after, but the cost is conceptual, not felt—no option is foreclosed on the page. Because the guard’s agency does not trigger the tick, causality is soft; the closure lands as resonance, not earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught early via metallic-forest pattern; each wind-timbre adds density toward the nexus “with the force of probable miracles.” Closure is Charged Poise: gear-slot crystallizes options and reweights the forest as projected mind; solitude cost is felt. Causality is loose but coherent under lyric drive; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ticket punch re-cast from revenue tool to courage-igniter, dragons curled like living star-stamps. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure thickens through mirrored twilight, mist, lullaby—culminating in the charged image of invisible dragons riding ferry-guides back to daylight. Cost is felt: perpetual vigil, unseen burden, foreclosed normalcy. Causality is soft amid lyric drift, but the final reconfiguration obeys its own invented logic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of etched bolt → recognition of predatory pattern → decision to reverse ritual → sung note that awakens walls. Orientation anchors by line 3 (who/where/when). Closure is a Decisive Change: music re-enters the world; the cost—safety forfeited—is legible in the humming blue stone. The single tightening works, but the bolt’s first appearance is late (~65%), slightly delaying escalation; still, it pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dissolving pellet, each crumbling shelf layers density until the final rune shatters illusion. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—library collapses, crown rejected, fear unmasked—cost is felt in the dissolution of her ancestral refuge. One causality wobble: the ancestors’ warnings (“He wears your father’s face…”) appear overnight without prior set-up, a mild teleport of information.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative lens holds: tidal data, atlas overlay, and tapping rhythms layer until the “delayed revelation” reweights the premise. Orientation is clean—station, shelf-edge, post-ban era—by line 6. Closure is a Charged Poise: the folded atlas page becomes a conceptual re-pricing that the planet, not humans, now redraws the map. The cost is felt in her acceptance of erasure, but the beat is observational, not decisive, capping the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: the hum, light, and barefoot contact build a crescendo that reweights the stake from scavenging the mess to becoming its meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—arms raised, light rising—whose cost is the abandonment of her former tool (glasses) and implied surrender to the stones’ claim; the lens is coherent, but the beat could be sharper if one earlier option were explicitly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: plant-whispers → cave → embryo → kite-script → voiced key → chamber opens. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—tradition must evolve or die—made legible the instant Maya feels the embryo’s “warm and alive” weight. Orientation is clean within 60 words; only nitpick is the kite arriving by “sudden gust” which momentarily softens causality, but the plants immediately validate it, keeping lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the photo reweights both her survival mantra and the lighthouse-dark world. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—image folds, oyster shell, hands in soil pattern deepens until the final wind-toss dissolves the object with visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening: anniversary night forces the last fold/ release choice—options narrowed, stakes felt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed portrait crystallizes her reconfigured stance toward imperfection. Causality, however, is loose—thread-sorting stands in for psychological change without a visible constraint that forecloses her prior perfectionism. The lighthouse breathing and shifting cards flirt with surreal rule-changes, but the lens stays Accumulative/Textural; still, the cost is felt only as “beautiful pain,” not as a lost option or irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing (“We change our relationship to it”) that reframes the childhood question with undeniable cost (body dissolution, vitals spiking). Causal chain is tight: ink poured → consciousness sync → eclipse endpoint triggers dissolution → return with new knowledge. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity. The single shard design stays within 600-800 default; reflection is interleaved with present action and obeys BRR cap.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: power fluctuation → thaw → read → transmit → wait for dawn. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by line 3. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the archive’s silence flips from oppressive to electric—yet the price (her life of service) is asserted more than dramatized on the final beat, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sheathing of pruners crystallizes the ongoing project of “healing the fractured world one blossom,” re-weighting the sandbag-turned-pouch motif. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than dramatic; each rose-tending beat thickens the texture of continuity. The lens holds, the cost is the daily labor itself, visible on-page. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s returned rhythms are now “subtly enriched,” an undeniable reweighting that costs the fisher future self-ignorance. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density rises via repeating zig-zags and silence-pockets until the goddess-echo is caught, then cadence relaxes, proving the pattern. Cost is legible in the softened, alive rail spike and in the trace that will permanently bend the constellations’ paths.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-scene causal spine holds: journalist call → retreat to observatory → proof by contradiction → dawn phone call. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a declared decision, not a dramatized act; cost is asserted (“symbol of her commitment”) rather than felt. Because the decisive external action (calling the journalist) is off-page, the Decisive Change is only half-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lullaby vibration reweights his silence and the meteor hush persists as stillness, cost felt in floorboard pulse and new tattoo. Causal chain (amber→firmware→fold→song→tattoo) is clean; no teleporting props. Time-fold rule is taught early via Arden letter; orientation anchored by word 60. One tightening beat suffices; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: mosaic of beach days, mandala layers, and arriving strangers tighten the stake from private ritual to communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the collective hush is re-weighted from feared silence to respectful anticipation, with conceptual cost—tomorrow they will sweep it away. Orientation anchors early; transitions between days are legible. No meaningful constraint or persistent price is dramatized on Silas personally, so the effect is communal rather than protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the act of renaming re-weights the ruins from dead history to living city, felt cost = Elias’s solitary vulnerability under a broken sky. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; the mosaic’s accumulating touches build density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (ancient plaza, shattered sky, after fire). No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught by the second paragraph and held to last line. Cost proof: “the tessera seemed brighter” – the plaza’s new light is the visible price of his mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory echoes and color-ribbons layer toward the final cadence. Closure attains Charged Poise—the garden’s renewed glow and the vanishing coin reconfigure meaning—but the cost is only implied (“spectral essence” spent). Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore; timeline mending is metaphorical, its mechanism asserted not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is present as a soft Charged Poise: the new protocol is declared, the geode tucked “against her heart,” and hope is rebranded from fragile to “lighting her way.” Cost, however, is conceptual rather than dramatized—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated light-pattern imagery and heartbeat micro-data accrete until meaning crystallizes, but the final sentence drifts into explicit thesis (“she became a believer…”) which mildly blunts the reconfiguration. Orientation is secure inside the studio within the first 60 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the fossil levitates into her pouch, reweighting her role—yet the cost feels ornamental (no risk, forfeiture, or persistent constraint is staged on-page). Causal chain is thin: because she is “different,” the cave waits; because she touches, knowledge downloads; escalation is more accumulative texture than tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the warehouse becomes a center of shared wisdom, reweighting the premise. Causality is soft—buttons patterning into prophecy is more associative than because/therefore—but the accumulative lens is taught early and holds; the final communal glow carries undeniable social cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of mist, snow codes, and pillbox reprise build density until the lattice-key image crystallizes an Earned Stasis—he turns downhill having accepted irreparable fractures. Causality is internal but coherent: each snow code = a conversation with himself that deepens resolve, culminating in the pillbox re-purposing. Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("windswept zephyr bluff") and stays spatially legible. Cost is conceptual—the codes' inevitable thaw mirrors the invisible promise—but still felt in the final "silver hush" approval.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each droplet, hoof-beat, and crimson knot layers texture until the final cadence shift when the gutters fall silent, yielding a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration that re-weights the crossing as an eternal threshold. While orientation anchors early and the pattern is legible, the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than embodied—no live traveler is endangered, no personal stake visibly forfeited—so the emotional price feels oblique rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the smoke flattens into a portal, Kael decides to return with others, and the conceptual cost—now he bears memory’s keepership—hits on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each attentive gesture thickens the texture of possibility until past/present/future resolve into one charged moment. Orientation anchored by the second sentence (who, where, when, motive); mosaic pattern taught early by lantern-glass visions; transitions legible across beats. No causality gaps; the final tightening is the thrumming ground + flattening smoke, not a random flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a luminous CR: the alcove’s reframed darkness re-prices Mara’s urban gardening into moon-tending, with the cost of perpetual exile from daylight community. Causal chain: petal drop → urge → row → Jim reveal → light work → dawn renunciation, each because/therefore tight. No teleport, no amnesia; the gauge’s dual use (key/helio-torch) is seeded early and paid off last line. Under Causal lens, the final image crystallizes options with undeniable social cost—she now tends a harbor no one sees.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical callbacks (sundial, hum, mirror) build toward Charged Poise ending. Closure is present—library’s hum becomes her pulse—but causality is retrospective (“she had learned”) rather than a tightening sequence of because/therefore beats. Orientation is clear by line 5, yet the story never risks a decisive present-tense action that would pay visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the lotus temple, rain, and installation accumulate density until the nest re-weights her stance—an earned Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 4; however, the reflective blocks (lines 5-9 and 12-15) are pure exposition without present-tense cueing, breaching the 20 % ceiling and flattening pressure. Closure image is resonant (“prismatic quiet”) and conceptually re-prices her vocation, but the cost is stated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: charts → pattern → subsonic build → silence; silence is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (cosmic war declared). One scaffold loop—"community divides grew deeper each day" appears twice without new information—clips perfect clarity, but closure lands intact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: dormant magic period → compass activation → starlight threading → portal opens → she crosses. The portal’s appearance is a micro-turn, not luck, seeded by her humming that matches the fallow resonance. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she abandons her world, compass left glowing and useless behind. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only momentary fuzziness is the exact geography of the nexus, but spatial choreography recovers before the threshold step.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a tidy off-stage confession triggered by a ribbon ID; the Decisive Change is reported, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual only (“justice dormant” line). Causal chain skips from inference to phone call to solved case, thinning because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early; no meaningful tightening narrows Elena’s options—discovery feels cumulative, not hazardous. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds but lacks a charged final image that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: decoded stanza → hidden panel → ancestral tech → climatic reversal. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Eli triggers a system that could upend meteorological orthodoxy—made legible in the final image of blue light sweeping the boards. Orientation is clean within 120 words; station, timeframe, and stakes are anchored. One minor slack: the stanza’s “reversible technology” is revealed as exposition rather than discovered through a beat that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias commits to trans-world passage, cost paid by relinquishing terrestrial certitude; the flake-projected bridge image makes the conceptual re-price undeniable. Causality holds—each recount utterance literally re-configures the scaffold wrap—so Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and holds to last line. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props or late rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    A cleanly inferred Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers another territorial map until the foreign bills re-weight to “lessons learned.” Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias boxes the currencies and the circus train recedes; no teleporting props or causal amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “understanding dawned completely” reweights the telegram and temple dreams, turning isolation into collaboration with visible emotional cost (“satisfaction of a quest fulfilled”). Causality under the Accumulating/Textural lens coheres—each night-dream layer adds density until the variable-star pattern breaks the code. The single weakness is that the decisive turn is off-stage in the gap between Elara’s solo telescope moment and Thorne’s entrance; we witness the result, not the irreversible micro-choice. Nevertheless, the final image crystallizes options and meaning, satisfying the 9+ quick test for closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands: the glamour is stripped, mentor freed, druid accepts truth—an earned Conceptual Repricing with social cost (mentor’s centuries-hidden identity). Causality wobbles: the seed’s sudden blood-activation is assertive, not set-up; the six expanding circles repeat rather than tighten; orientation is late—vortex rules taught only after 120 wds, but the disorientation does not repay at closure. Lens = Accumulative; pattern (circles, seed, mirror-absence) accretes toward final image, yet escalation feels additive, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a conceptual re-pricing: covenant redefined, visionary freed from self-bind. Causal chain is loose—scars=map is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (scar-touch → light → maze regrows) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; future-early rule stays fuzzy yet charges the final image enough to satisfy short-form RR.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the card absorbs the memory, reweighting Elara’s eternal task with undeniable conceptual cost (“the patch was complete… through her sacrifice”). Causal lens holds: each beat follows “because/therefore” from card pulse to spirit surrender. One soft spot: the barter itself is retro-told rather than shown, muting the full price on the final image. Orientation is clean by line 10; no prop or geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: cloth handled → memories accumulate → cadence shifts to authentication act; closure lands via Charged Poise (sealed bag, reclaimed passion) with conceptual cost that reweights his hollow life. Orientation anchor hits by line 4; no causality gaps. One transition (foreman entry) is legible, but escalation is textural deepening, not causal chain—permitted under lens. Closure image (“this was what remained”) is on-page and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: spirit abandons → translator must act → analogical chain → seed pulses → journey begins. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the boarding of the vessel reconfigures her isolation into continuum, cost legible in the seed’s heavier pulse. One soft spot: the arbor itself is withheld, so the decisive change is prospective, not actual.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the librarian’s synthetic self is legitimized by the tidal emptying, giving the paradox a felt social cost (“neither archivist nor story-weaver”). Accumulative lens holds: each paragraph layers water/identity imagery that tightens to the final crystallization. Orientation is waived because disorientation (no fixed “who” for three sentences) is taught early and repaid by the closing “forever in flux.” However, the smelt-and-mold beat is summarized, blunting the decisive physical act that could have sealed causality.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown’s invisible weight reconfigures her mission with undeniable conceptual cost—“walls… could be dissolved.” Causal linkage holds: discovery of passage → pearl → crown → new purpose, each beat a because/therefore step. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“concrete corridors”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes options under Causal drive. Persistent constraint—the crown’s perpetual light only she senses—shapes later tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: accordion set on stone, Elena’s tears joining the hidden river, a Charged Poise that reweights self-forgiveness as flow rather than fix. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each graffiti line thickens pattern until recognition tips her underground—acceptable under Accumulative lens, but “because/ therefore” links are faint. One minor lapse: “weeks since she stopped medication” is told late (word 47) yet is causal premise—orientation hook could be earlier. No teleporting objects or amnesia; the final image leaves the reader with undeniable conceptual cost (grief accepted, not solved).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of mist, reversed watch, floating books intensifies mood rather than causality. Closure lands as Charged Poise—library fades, watch ticks forward, dreamer departs with journal—but the cost is only asserted ("knowledge now their secret"). The cipher’s rule-set is never legible enough to make the final reweighting feel earned; we are told the watch is spent rather than shown the price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (arctic light, mulberry drapes, frost pollen) thickens until the violin’s internal fracture becomes inevitable. Closure is a Charged Poise—tiny ice violin budding from rose root—whose conceptual cost (Empire gets hollow trophy) is unmistakable. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Persistent constraint: harmonic frequency documented earlier dictates the pollen tactic; price shapes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual deepens pattern by pattern until the shelf of vials accretes new weight; closure is Charged Poise—the aurora’s next shimmer reframes her endless task. One continuous scene, orientation clean at 50 words. No causal reversal, but cadence shift from “finding static” to “pattern complete” tightens the stake of preservation. Cost is conceptual (another life bottled, task never ends) and felt in the final image of “next journey already revealing itself in static.”

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: hairpin warmth + cloud-floor kneeling dramatize her shift from seeking to being the source, cost legible under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 5; one soft transition (ascent→grotto) is taught by spatial anchors. Cyclic refrain risks over-explanation, but persistent scallop/cedar imagery tightens pattern without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet CR: the shard’s flicker of possibility reweights Elian’s perpetual detachment, making the cost of endless doubt legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned wind-chime motifs and smoke wisps accrete until the final image crystallizes the stakes of his profession. Orientation is swift; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric design. The cost is felt, not declared, satisfying the CR rule.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elien’s decade returning reweights every prior beat under the Accumulative/Textural lens—time literally paid for knowledge. Causality is clean: stone → rings → vanish → appear, each step tightening the paradox. Orientation is taught early (“floating rock meditation platform”) and pays off when the grotto glows, waiving any penalty. The withheld rule is revealed only when Maya sees the rings in trance, satisfying the delayed-revelation contract without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: resonance layers accrue through echo, pulse, and stone-skimming repetition until the final charged poise reweights “navigation without moving.” Orientation is secured by line 3; transitions are clean within one continuous canyon scene. Closure lands cleanly: the arrowhead’s new pulse is the Conceptual Repricing that makes Kael’s disappearance legible as completion, not death. The price—his erasure—could be sharper on the page, but the reconfiguration is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: banned archive → mist-walk → keystone → unstrap → luminous bloom. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: automated magic’s rule-set is reweighted by the keystone’s unsourceable glow, the cost being the irreproducible nature of wonder. Orientation is clean by line 3; transitions (archive → mid-air → folly) are signaled by ritual names. The lens wobbles mid-text—accumulative lyric passages sit beside causal steps—but lands in causal repricing, so penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous object (lanterns, key, books, flames) layers density until the final image reweights the stake. The lighthouse door appears without set-up, a mild teleport, but the library portal repays the cheat by making the water/non-water rule legible in action. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself becomes his vow, undeniable cost painted overhead.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal spine is present—filter static, cast coins, read spiral, transmit—but escalation is flat because each beat restates the same stakes instead of narrowing them. The backwards prophecy is declared cryptic yet never constrains tactics; its only function is to delay clarity. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (spiral = rebirth) but the cost is cosmological, not personal, so the legible price test fails for Loran.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: naming “Solitude” crystallizes stance with visible weight-loss of cloak. Accumulative lens holds—each naming beat thickens pattern until moonlight final image reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by 80 words; single transition inside observatory keeps causality clean. No teleporting props; atlas flip at breeze supplies new map without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands: the bell’s “lukewarm” toll audibly rebalances the sea, a clean Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (silence → life). Causality is loose, however—dripping-rate lore is declared rather than tested—and the Orientation Test triggers: who/where/when is clear by word 40, but the cosmic imbalance rule is introduced after midpoint with no prior cue, so a −0.3 applies, capping Q2 at 7.2 and Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn light on rooftops crystallizes a new public stance whose cost is legible—he forfeits the official story he has policed. Causal chain (label → photo trail → aunt recognition → decision) holds; only the wind-chime device is slightly convenient, not decisive. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; one seamless time-lapse to dawn keeps the shard count legal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transformed crystal levitates, re-weighting her prior failures, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (starlings, flame, waterfall) tightens to a resonant image. However, the middle is a single long beat of watching birds; no option narrows and no price is paid on-page, so escalation is flat. The causal chain is “she watches → she places → it glows,” which feels like and-then sequencing rather than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: star-whispers, sensor anomalies, and the decoded mantra layer into a Charged Poise where survival math is rewritten but payment is still suspended. Closure is legible—trust must be re-earned under new atmospheric rules—yet the parachute remains unraveled, so decisive change is conceptual, not physical. Causality is intact; spatial/temporal anchors land by line 5; orientation waiver applies but is paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal spine holds: because she can see pretense, she is tasked; because she fears numbness, she embraces pain; therefore the brain stirs and history rewrites. The orientation is swift (floating dojo, shimmer of rewrite) and the closure beats—brain pulsing, Maya smiling—deliver a visible Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: duplication is now personhood. One soft spot: the “complementary opposites” mechanic is asserted late, not seeded early, so the final image feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: planting the seed = safeguarding innovation space. Cost is only metaphorical (patience), not tethered to an on-page forfeiture; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, but the final image lacks a palpable price. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Causality, however, is loose: the seed triggers reflection, not action, and the decisive act (planting) changes no immediate option.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the impossible giggle reweights the rule “silence = absence,” leaving Silas in Charged Poise—sanctuary of absence is now habitable. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each modulation thickens the sonic pattern until the tunnel returns an echo that breaks it. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“echo chamber tunnel…pull cord handle”). The only minor slip: the hourglass is mentioned twice but never given an on-page spatial relationship to the tunnel, so its symbolic cost is felt but not physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “home was not a place but a state of consciousness” reweights the stake, and the image of translucent edges is legible. Causality, however, is accumulative-lyric, not causal: the pendant’s warming is repeated rather than explained, so the final thinning of boundaries reads as mystical inevitability, not because/therefore. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity, but the escalation beat is the same descriptive swirl three times, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the staff is no longer relic but living extension, and the family destiny is foreclosed by visible transformation. Causal linkage holds—each approximation tightens the next, culminating in the dissolve-before-rebuild insight. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (ember nexus, twilight, bare feet). Final image carries persistent constraint: he must now walk the world with a torch-compass no bishop ever wielded. Cost is unmistakable in the phrase “understanding that the hopeless had never been his nature but merely his training.”

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure cleanly satisfies Conceptual Repricing: the towers’ hum reweights the city as a living relic, cost is visible in Elara’s solitary descent. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mounting silence → resonance → quiet again—held without contradiction. Orientation anchors arrive by word 60; no penalty. Escalation is modest (one tightening), but sufficient for sub-800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the once-empty hourglass fills, marking timeline merger with visible cost (Liam is now “ephemeral”). Causality is loose—patterns taught late, radio beats merely confirm rather than alter—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, and the final image reweights prior motifs. Orientation is functional; only the “interconnected patterns” remain abstract until payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new thread-absorption thickens the gallery’s reality until it crystallizes into shared consciousness. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words and closure lands as Charged Poise: two siblings in a breathing dreamscape with undeniable conceptual cost—dreams now demand relational payment. Persistent constraint: once the tapestry awakens, solitary control is impossible. One hairline slip: “memories altered within his mind” is vague temporal hand-off.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chain link in his palm re-weights the city’s role in humanity’s cosmic future under an Accumulative lens. Causality is intact—edge geometry predictions are confirmed—yet the decisive confirmation happens off-page, softening cost visibility. Anchor who/where/when is clear inside 120 words; no orientation debt. The ending image succeeds, but the missing on-page verification of failure/risk prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is legible: pulse → garden → child → predator → intervention; closure lands with conceptual cost (grandmother’s warning finally heeded). Orientation clean by 120 words; transitions are soft ellipses rather than explicit, yet still track. Lens holds as Causal; one meaningful tightening suffices. Stakes declared early and finally materialize, satisfying the 600-800 word closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causality holds: tide window → descent → Codex ignition → guided transitions → exit before reclaim. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 120 words and are echoed in the 42-minute clock. Closure—the quiet renunciation of self to perpetual duty—carries felt cost in the final image of her heart knowing only “sacred silence between.” No lens ambiguity; Accumulatively textured pressure tightens to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ink-pattern divination steadily thickens atmosphere until the final “transformation” line reweights existence. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—error → new life-form—but the cost is asserted (“this strange existence”) rather than felt; no constraint or price shapes tactics. One meaningful tightening (ink reveals sabotage) is sufficient for length, yet the beat changes knowledge only, not options.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the diamond sings, reweighting the premise with audible cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—decades of ritual pattern reach cadence shift rather than because/therefore chain—valid under lens rules. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The one soft spot: the “never-before-seen” bird pattern is pure coincidence that triggers rather than complicates, but it does not resolve the conflict, so penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical CR—“cultivate the frostbitten hope”—but the cost is abstract; no prior tactic is renounced on-page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of witness accumulates until stance crystallizes. Causality stays loose: the arrowhead’s warmth and phone music echo but do not force a final decision, so the ending feels poised rather than decisively changed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: crystalline vines on the bridge reweight the premise and carry undeniable conceptual cost (beauty now irreversibly leaks into metal). Causal chain is thin—permission from a tree via violin heartbeat is granted off-stage—but the accumulative pattern (each beat adds wonder) holds. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. The price is felt in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test, yet the middle lacks a tightening turn that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bottled storm crosses, the mother vanishes, Elias walks off under real rain—conceptual cost (he can never stop) is legible in the ledger absence. Causal lens holds: because he mapped drone gaps, therefore the bottle passes; because the guards scan for weapons, meteorology slips through. One shard, one transition (booth → street), time anchored by shift change; no orientation debt, no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“misting hush… canvas of possibility”) and held: each sensory layer thickens until the final cadence shift reweights the stake from silence to voiced song. Causality is lyric rather than sequential—escalation occurs by pattern break (oasis appears) and density surge (horses animate)—but the closure is unmistakable: the bell-token reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (voice regained, fragment lost). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: “door had never existed” is a late world-rule tweak, though it pays off instantly and does not rupture logic.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s physical rules rewrite themselves around her, visible only to Margaret, and the scarf’s disappearance locks the change. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each pass of night-work and shelving tightens the emotional pattern until the hyperbolic stack literally curves space. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3 and never slips. The cost is legible in the final image—she returns to the desk “with the scarf now stitched into her very soul,” a permanent, irreversible fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sunrise layer tightens the emotional density until the map emerges. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—sister = light—whose cost is the renunciation of retrieval. Causality is metaphorical yet internally consistent; book arrival is the only grace-note coincidence. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the ribbon dissolves into starlight, reweighting both client and locksmith with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—star hint → disorientation → ribbon ignition of mental door—without loopholes. One minor scaffold: “idea has wings” line repeats the metaphor already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: decades of sketches and orchard visits compress into one dawn-lit reclamation. The closure—touching each mushroom to reknit memory—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the fairy-ring rule-set; shipwrecks “settle deeper” as visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and hold. Micro-turn at seventh alignment satisfies meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions (“verdant parapet,” “radiant hush”) tighten mood until a Conceptual Repricing lands in the rainbow-casting seed. Closure is legible: the waterfall-softened hush crystallizes a charged poise where wonder is banked for future harvest, and the pruner’s exhaustion/surrender supplies felt cost. Orientation is complete by line 5; transitions are unnecessary in this single-scene design. One persistent constraint—her life-force invested—shapes the final image, satisfying high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final stillness reconfigures both Jacob’s burden and Elena’s brokenness without tidy repair. Causal chain holds—every knot pulled releases a whisper that feeds Elena’s silence-storage, making the hush literally denser. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (prism sanctuary, starlight, two named bodies). No teleporting props; the net’s rope age is learned through action, not dump. Cost is undeniable: Elena’s “own damage repaired” is explicitly partial, a single tile in a shattered mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the henge is not rebuilt but re-understood, and the map is mended to mark a threshold, not a gap—an irreversible re-weighting of knowledge with felt cost (“she would share her discovery, but in the same spirit of shielded openness”). Causal linkage holds: because she methodically compares silent footage, she spots the celestial pattern; because she spots it, she abandons the need to expose the site physically. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“rain-scoured fresco vault”). One lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds throughout; pressure escalates via density of pattern rather than external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural pattern holds cleanly: repeated, increasingly charged inspections of the snow-globe miniatures tighten the emotional aperture until the object re-prices its own meaning. Closure is an unmistakable CR beat—“now the plane was gone entirely”—that forces an irreversible re-think of both Amelia’s words and Elara’s grief. The orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (sunken library, snow globe in hand). What blocks 9+ is that the only persistent external constraint (deep-sea pressure) remains ornamental; it never shapes tactics or exacts a price, so the cost is purely conceptual rather than physical or relational.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the “silent song” image reweights the premise with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose—how the plate actually transcodes thought-to-graffiti remains magical—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The flower-press plate and graffiti mechanic stay consistent, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density, diary+goggles pattern taught by 120 words, crystalline imagery recurs with escalating weight. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored immediately inside the elevator; no debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scattered-light decryption crystallizes her understanding and reweights servitude into stewardship. Cost is palpable—she descends still a servant but now bearing invisible knowledge she can never speak.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens immediately: adrift gondola → cloud-sentience notebook → “empty spaces remember.” Each cloud-stanza adds density until the cirrus-cumulus-stratus “conversation” reweights the stake, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost—if she publishes, science will brand her a heretic; if she stays silent, her mentor vanishes twice. No causal cheats: the broken string strands her before the pattern hunt, and the same cloud formation that took Thorne now offers data. Closure beat (“she wasn’t stranded—she was exactly where she needed to be”) crystallizes options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the walls now “shimmer with a network of interlocking patterns” that reconfigure portraiture itself, and the cost is legible—she forfeits the literal sky to keep the invisible one. Causal lens dominates (each beat because/therefore: blindness → pattern obsession → coin discovery → new method). Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Only a micro-slip: the coin’s “algorithmic key” function is revealed rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: starlings → hopscotch cipher → phrasebook → containment insight, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the airship becomes “repository of ancient knowledge,” re-weighting Eli’s world. Cost is intellectual rather than visceral—future burden of proof implied, not felt. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the broken clockwork heart is restored, melting the library and reframing Elias’s pilgrimage from acquisition to stewardship. The image carries cost—ancestral faces flood the mirrors, proving continuity—but the causality between heart-box and thaw is asserted, not shown in staggered beats. Orientation is secure: frozen library, eclipse morning, single POV anchored in first 120 words. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through recurring mirror/reflection imagery until the cadence shift, not through external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present—planet saved, ghost fades—but the decisive change occurs off-stage: the larvae miracle is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. Causality is linear and smooth (chalk → discovery → bell → revival), yet the midpoint lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option; escalation is additive, not consequential. Orientation is clear by word 50, but the lens drifts from causal to accumulative without a pattern taught early, muting final resonance. No persistent constraint or price shapes the last image, capping resonance at “pleasant” rather than “indelible.”

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the crack accepts the lullaby, the spindle pulses, entropy is reprieved. The cost is cosmic, not personal, but the page makes that cost legible (“the hush remained… holding the lullaby safe”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence re-weight the stake—and the pattern is taught early (“pane of hush”) and honored at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain is present yet thin: blueprint → nut → compass → rescue, each link asserted rather than pressured. The night-frost clock is announced late (~60 %) and never tightens options on-page; travelers are saved the moment the device is turned on. Closure lands as declarative uplift (“he felt at peace”) without a visible price or constraint that forecloses any future path.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal arc: argument ➜ ravine descent ➜ foam insight ➜ phone atonement. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the braided river re-images future relationship options with conceptual cost. Beat count is efficient; however, the sister’s instant reconciliation dampens the decisive change, letting Elara off lightly. Still, the lens holds and the image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the vendor realizes stories begin in absence, not place. Cost is conceptual—emptiness reframed as origin—felt via the charged final image of bottled moonlight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of bottled phases → memory shards → blank slate accumulates to the reweighting. Causality is soft (ritual rules are asserted, not tested), but the ending retroactively justifies the drift.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: Kael steps out lighter because he has metabolized communal regret, a decisive inner change. Causality inside the pavilion is lyric/accumulative rather than tight “because-therefore”; the sand reveals stairs when Kael “reads” it, a quasi-magical leap not fully seeded. Early orientation is swift—chef, desert fort, post-rain—but the dream frame (“close of an unspoken dream”) stays abstract and never re-weights the ending, so the dream cue feels ornamental. Still, the final lens is coherent: the pattern is “taste → absorb → refine → emerge changed.”

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clear: discovery of weight → talks reboot → bridge project. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the restored weight/timepiece reweights community time—but the cost is communal, not personal to Elena, so the lens stays Hybrid. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (basement→library) and it’s sign-posted.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing—the broken mirror reframes abandonment as possibility—but the cost is asserted (“permanently changed”) rather than dramatized in a final beat. Causal chain is loose: activating the device is a single action that instantly floods the engineer with entangled memories; no intermediate failure, recalibration, or external consequence escalates the stakes. The mirror’s “imperfections allowing refraction” is the one persistent constraint that shapes the tech premise, earning a modest bump. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clean: doodle → inversion → threshold → seeds → escape. Orientation lands by ~100 words; gravity rule and 60-minute clock are taught early and honored. Closure is a tidy success without a visible price; the manuscript warming her leg is gesture-only, so the Decisive Change reads as purely affirmative. Under the Lens ambiguity cap: story never risks failure, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The text lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is conceptually repriced—now “resonant with echoes” for Elara alone—at undeniable emotional cost (her tears). Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative: each strummed crack deepens knowledge until empathy itself becomes the tightening. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“siskin alder grove”) and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first image to final hush. No artifact touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the nexus rewrites exile into partnership, stone dent glowing as visible cost. Causal chain holds: each magnetic pulse correlates to a withheld chess move, leading to the recognition that acknowledgment, not sacrifice, satisfies the covenant. The 3-day clock tightens options until the final alignment. One hairline slip: “the mountains didn’t want restitution” arrives as narrator gloss rather than experiential discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added frequency layers density until pattern-break (diary opens) reweights stakes. One clean causal hinge—tuning resonance matches owner’s emotional signature—justifies climax; no teleporting props or plot amnesia. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s mission reframed with conceptual cost (“next calling”). Firework-light catharsis externalizes the shift, satisfying cost proof. Minor time dilation: fifteen-year backstory summary eats word-count but doesn’t rupture present causality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-build via scent, doodles, and generational paper until a cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of village lights crystallizes her new role and forecloses the wanderer path. Cost is conceptual—she becomes rooted—made legible in “the anchor point for a destiny she now embraced.” Orientation is clean; transitions are single elastic climb within one scene. One causal seam is thin: the elders’ “quiet approval” floats in without prior pressure, but it does not resolve the conflict, only observes, so lens integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is intact: inversion → river-road → echoes → arrow payoff → reset. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “whirling silence” flips to “familiar sounds,” imprinting wisdom with visible cost—he must now act as steward. One soft patch: the echoes’ content is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece ends on the forecast of future measurements rather than a decisive change or charged poise; the town is still silent, Elena is still documenting, stakes remain prospective. The “singular convergence” is named as mystery, not reweighted. Closure is deferred, so the causal chain never tightens into cost. Orientation is fine, but the promised pivot never arrives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each bell-strike layers chromatic density until the cavern itself becomes a resonant instrument. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“heart of the glacial cathedral”); no debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpted hush blooms into a silence the crowd can taste—undeniable conceptual cost. The tightening is single but sufficient: the last chord fuses every prior color into white, reweighting perception itself.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral of driftwood and the escalating flute sequences tighten the same stake—how to live after failure—until the cadence shift in the final note reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise: pearlescent air, tears washing guilt, silence transmuted; the cost is the guardianship path forever closed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside the first 90 words; no disorientation. One driftwood-to-stream beat returns each stick to its source, crystallizing the before/after legible in a single image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanishing-star tally reframes her cruelty as cosmic routine, cost legible in “another boundary breached.” Causal chain holds—letter → visit → transfer → dismissal—but the story withholds Thomas’s stakes until late, so the Orientation Test nudges down.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: aurora-lit treks, germinating footprints, and pendant-glow layers accrue until the final image reweights “routine” into wonder. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chest-hollow and tremoring earth make the cost felt without overt declaration. One causality gap: the shortcut beat (old woman) is lovely but unmotivated—why share it?—yet it doesn’t break the dominant pattern. Orientation is solid; stakes tighten from delivery task to self-redefinition; the ending image crystallizes options under its own lyrical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prism stores not just emotion but whole memories, re-weighting her life’s quest. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—frost patterns intensify until the reveal—but the midpoint lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option. The “truthful lies” refrain is told, not dramatized, softening the cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens is clear: each vanished sound thickens the hush and the bead’s glow intensifies, creating a patterned escalation toward the puzzle-path sacrifice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—sound returns—but the cost is conceptual (silence as presence) rather than felt; Elara forfeits memories yet shows no on-page anguish or limitation afterward, softening the “earned” quality. Orientation is anchored early; the mosaic of puzzle pieces is taught by 25 % and transitions remain legible. The lens holds, but the payoff’s emotional price is abstract, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: silk → trade → precision → arch supports → village seeking wisdom. The closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: azure glow on the arches = visible price + new status. No teleporting props; each beat tightens options. The “whisper of blue silk against steel” in the last line re-images the bargain, cementing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard dims, the door vanishes, and the map-maker vows to continue—cost is conceptual (spent power) rather than felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each timeline shard layers history-density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by 60 words; no因果 breaks. Yet the red-shard prohibition is the single tightening beat; another loop or irreversible loss would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the beam now “imbued with the presence of all who had tended it” reconfigures meaning and carries felt lineage-cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (glass, letters, stones) layers density until the final stack and letter tighten the stake. The piece never teaches the stone-code pattern early, so the ending’s weight leans on prior sentiment rather than a taught rule-set; this is acceptably paid off by the final line. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain holds: accidental prophecy → fleet arrival → beam-guided passage → earned “shadowed elation.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: she stays at post, aware the next laugh could kill. The manuscripts’ rule-set is introduced late and never tested, so the lens hovers between causal and situational, but the ending reweights the premise with visible cost—she is now hostage to her own mouth. One micro-turn: twin comets confirm her power, tightening stakes before the fleet arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dye recipe reframes storytelling itself, and the valley image reweights earlier stakes. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through color/light motifs until perception shifts; cost is conceptual (his stories will now serve every listener’s heartbeat), felt but not visceral. Orientation is swift; floating tea-house and rope-ladder anchor by line 5. However, the “three weeks after surgery” marker never tightens medical jeopardy or countdown, so escalation stays lyrical rather than urgent, keeping score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sorrow reframed as resilience, cost felt in his “weariness he hadn’t acknowledged.” Accumulative lens holds—images (sextant, pin-chime, dream frequencies) layer until meaning tilts. However, the decisive resonance is externally triggered; Samuel’s agency is limited to aligning sights, narrowing the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens declared in first paragraph (“fragments of light that never quite dawned”) and held to the final image of “awakened” realm. Orientation anchors—who, where, exotic rule-set—arrive by line 30; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise: the keeper’s rest is earned because every prior swaddle beat has depleted them; the cost is the scattered self left empty in exchange for communal dawn. No causal reversals needed; pattern break (night → possibility) reweights stakes under the lyric drive.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: invitation discovery → internal tightening → note refusal; the midnight clock compresses choice; closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the note handed over, path foreclosed) and the paradox re-weights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bread’s meaning flips from relic to shared absolution, felt cost in the act of leaving it. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of vanished objects and garden plantings reweights the stake of “noticing” until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (palace gates, rain, tea house). No prop teleport or causality break; the bakery’s disappearance is the given constraint, not a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final slide held aloft crystallizes a new possibility—preservation rather than loss—charged with felt cost of endless labor. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sampling beat adds density to the fading vows until the pattern break (some frequencies persist) reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by line 6 (who, where, when). No meaningful tightening narrows options; escalation is gradual frequency decay, not decisive trade-off, keeping the piece just below 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: each lie is a because/therefore trigger that moves Malachi toward exposing his lieutenant. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the watch now contains a “silence that screams,” reweighting Eliza’s odd collection and paying the premise’s cost. The single-scene orientation is anchored by word 60 (“beneath the rotting pier”) so no penalty applies. The only drag is a faint script-like feel to the rumor planting (“Word is…”)—minor but keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass dissolves into skin, undeniable conceptual cost (“ancient responsibility”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored aurora tallies + forest murmurs tighten from first line to last, reweighting prior research question into lived office. Spatial/temporal anchors (bluff, night, continuous scene) are clear <120 words; orientation intact. No meaningful escalation gap; the final image fuses premise to person with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Rhodes stands before the repainted portrait, fingers blacker than ever, acknowledging that the calling now feels like homecoming rather than haunting. Cost is felt in the same sentence—charcoal ground into skin and identity, a persistent price he accepts. Causal chain intact: discovered canvas → cave memory → decision to repaint; no off-stage resolution. Orientation achieved within 75 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of crystal/grief imagery tightens toward the final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elara reconfigures her quest from grand salvage to daily candor, and the cost is felt (“leaving behind the falsehoods she had previously tolerated”). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each artifact discovery thickens texture rather than tightens external stakes. The map-and-plate “lock-and-key” epiphany is slightly abstract—no immediate door opens—so the decisive change is conceptual, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-tuning session and color display adds density until the final spectrum reweights the community’s communicative world. Orientation is swift—who, where, when locked by line three. The iceberg fragment’s arrival at ~150 words is the single tightening beat that pivots from maintenance to creation; this deepening is decisive. Closure is a Charged Poise: the never-before-seen spectrum at Elara’s death crystallizes the stakes without verbal exposition, paying the cost in wonder rather than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the android’s fragmentation into micro-selves literalizes “controlled burn escape” and leaves the garden flourishing while the original form slumps—an irreversible price under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: every beat (magnetic pulse → dome shudder → box opened → miniaturize) tightens options. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letters re-weight the locket from private treasure to communal mirror, with a felt social cost—thirty years of unspoken gratitude made legible. Causality is accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pattern of dawn courtyard gatherings accumulates testimony until the mailbox reveal becomes inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no prop or knowledge teleport. The −0.4 non-closure cap applies: escalation stays flat—no narrowing option or rising price—so the ending’s reconfiguration is resonant but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands: the screens ignite and knowledge is “liberated,” a Decisive Change. Yet causality is soft—why dice-as-RNG or dance-as-password works is never grounded; the journal “dance instructions” arrive only in the final paragraph as retroactive permission. The Orientation Test is waived because the dim-sunken frame is stable, but the how/why gap keeps the lens Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Cost is conceptual (previous world order upended) but not felt by Elara on the page, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: re-burying the crystal with a flower makes the memory archive’s existence undeniable and forecloses retrieval—“visit, not remove” crystallizes cost. Causal chain intact: whale → gravity spikes → dig → crystal → recognition. Occasional paraphrase loops (“gleaming silence” reused) dull the final cadence a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early—moonlight, water, paper—and returns to it at the end when the reconstructed crane floats away, achieving a Charged Poise closure: the prophecy is contained, balance restored, and the hush itself becomes the cost. Causality is internal and ritualistic rather than external-event driven; each beat layers density rather than narrows options. Orientation is clear inside the first 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The final image reweights the stakes without exposition, meeting the 9+ test for closure with cost, but the absence of a second tightening keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal passes to Clara, reweighting her world (“the beginnings of fluency…”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds on an Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor-light on brass re-illuminates every earlier symbol, tightening pattern rather than plot. Orientation is clear by word 70; the rooftop jump is a single, legible shard transition. Setup/payoff coherence is clean, but the final beat is more image than irreversible decision.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: repeated "velvet garden" and shell motifs tighten mood until the blue pulse reweights isolation→independence. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final image of her walking away crystallizes the new burden—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: forged decree → exile → key arrival → reveal → redress. Each beat advances knowledge or options; the dissolve of marble is a micro-turn that unlocks the closure. The 120-word orientation test is met: “marble sanctuary beneath the shifting aurora” anchors by word 17. Closure lands with visible cost—blood on parchment, key vaporizing—signaling Earned Stasis: he forsakes the sanctuary and the forger identity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the child’s light re-configures her purpose with undeniable cost (the seashell falls silent, her heart “lighter than it had been in centuries”). Causal chain holds: because she listens → discloses → sings → re-balances nexus. One micro-transition (kneeling to place shell) is legible; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is present: the captain’s spirit is freed (Resonant Reconfiguration) and the descendants choose disclosure, both legible on-page. Causality is soft-threaded; the snow globe’s dream-mechanic is asserted, not tested or constrained, so the tightening feels ornamental rather than tactical. Orientation is clean—glacier shrine, wreck site, timeline all anchored within 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeating dream fragments accrue until public revelation; pattern holds but lacks a felt price from Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the final foam-image reweights “hidden effort” with conceptual cost, satisfying RR. Causality is accumulative-textural: each shard adds density rather than narrows options; the lens is declared and stable. Orientation is clear by line 20, transitions are legible. The piece never escalates stakes—only deepens mood—so the tightening criterion is met via cadence shift, not event. No plot amnesia or retro-patching; the loop is deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s “warmth” reweights the rumor of curse into conduit of hope, with implicit future peril. Causal chain holds—letters → stillpoint truth → decision to conceal—but the pivotal “reassembling shredded letters” is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the felt cost. Drive lens is Causal; because/therefore links stay intact and the final image narrows options (secrecy with corp danger).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each storm session layers density until the cobalt portico re-projects Elias’s own findings back to him as the prophet’s rise. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the lonely visionary smiled” crystallizes that translation, not leadership, was his destined cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; causal linkage is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern. –0.3 for late cost visibility; smile is legible but could carry sharper forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the room sings, generations touch, and the poet’s life gains purpose—cost is implied but not felt on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of captured sounds → music box → communal release tightens meaning without causal reversals. One shard, no orientation debt. Missing a tangible constraint or price that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the key vibrates → Elias races; because he reaches the orb → he strikes the fork; therefore the lighthouse weaponizes its own resonance. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the intruders’ boat drifts empty, the lighthouse’s hum is renewed, and Elias’s changed stance is crystallized in the forehead-touch. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed inside 50 words. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (guardian duty) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn thaw crystallizes the mapper’s Earned Stasis—continued quiet labor with visible cost of lifelong solitude. Accumulative/textural lens holds: moon-path density and viaduct hum tighten the stake toward a Charged Poise. Causality is soft (no opposing force), but pattern is taught early and payoff is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: drought → flooded tunnel → exposed lantern → damning note → moral imperative. Orientation is swift and spatially clean; the single-scene beat advances because/therefore. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern re-weights her professional rule-set with undeniable social cost. Cost is visible—“this death was scripted”—but the final beat is a private whisper, not an irreversible act, so the decisive change is slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silent heart in pocket reweights “justice” from mechanical repair to lived restitution. Causal chain holds—Grant’s apology → house purchase → heart’s stop → refusal of repair—all signaled on page. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (dusty window, antique shop, city corner). One shard; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final line: “its silence now speaking more loudly than any ticking gear ever could.”

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned imagery and recursive motifs (mirrors, gears, acid sea) reweight the stake of unheard achievement. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—after the bell rings unheard, the acid sea’s momentary stillness re-prices the entire quest, making the silence itself the visible cost. The causal chain is thin (arrow → kaleidoscope → chamber), but the lyric design teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for closure under an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: patch → numbers → breach → download → flight. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (she is now hunted). Orientation is late—archive geography only crystallizes at ~180 words, but the delay ultimately feeds the “digital necropolis” image, so waiver applies. One minor teleport: alarms “scream behind her” after she is already gone, softening cause/effect immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain—mirror glimpses → shard → orchard spell → whole crystal—lands cleanly with a visible glowing artifact as cost. Orientation is swift: Elena, lighthouse orchard, full-moon ice night within 60 words. A single micro-turn (weighted breath before elders’ reply) tightens stakes; closure is Charged Poise: the hovering crystal reconfigures meaning, foreclosing doubt. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: drift-ice images and lace parasol re-appearances thicken emotional density until the final image reframes “endings” into “beginnings.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s decision to stay crystallizes with the parasol’s warmth against her hip—felt, not declared. Causality is loose (Marcus’s gnomic advice functions as thematic echo rather than pivot), but the pattern holds. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal imagery and letter-touch repetitions cadence toward a Charged Poise closure (“he found his calling…quiet cultivation of understanding”). Cost is conceptual—acceptance of perpetual incompleteness—but because the sentinel’s stance never materially changes (he was already sitting, reflecting), the “before/after” is faint. Pattern is taught early and coherent; transitions not needed in single-scene design. Closure lands, yet feels more epiphanic than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the consecrated clearing holds, the echo is “stored,” and the walker departs with renewed purpose—an imagistic RR with conceptual cost. Causality, however, is loose; the kinetic parapet responds because “it always had,” not because the ritual beats pressure-tested an earlier choice. Orientation anchor (who/where) is delayed past 120 words, but the lyric disorientation later pays off in the final image, so the penalty is waived. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet escalation is one-note—density thickens but never tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal ladder is faint: discovery of arcs is back-story, and today’s ritual works on the first try with no visible obstacle or price. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but closure is a group hug rather than a decisive change or charged poise; the “golden glow” simply restates the mood already established. Because no option is foreclosed and no cost is dramatized, the ending lands as textured affirmation, not narrative closure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s dawn tone reweights his mission from archival fixation to forward-looking translation, felt cost legible in the image of dust rising “like spirits.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens—each echoic return thickens pattern recognition until the final resonance reconfigures meaning. The reflective blocks (∼30 %) are interleaved with present-tense sensory cueing, satisfying the BRR exception. One minor loop: “fractured sequences” is repeated five times without fresh inflection, dulling the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chalked spiral completes, the arch hums, and the prophet accepts imminent forgetting—conceptual cost is legible. Causal chain is slender (caretaker’s grandmother tape) yet coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern of driftwood→memory→sound tightens once and holds. Orientation beats the 120-word mark cleanly; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: shaking foundations → clock anomaly → tuning filters. Orientation (who/where) lands by line 4; the moon viewport is a clear anchor. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—camera now records “luminous energy”—but the cost is asserted (“never be fully captured”) rather than dramatized with a concrete loss. No causality break, yet the absence of a felt forfeiture keeps it just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the son holding the broken vinyl while the narrator keeps playing reconfigures meaning without tidy repair. Cost is legible in the father’s last sight of an impossible promise (“I’ll fix it”) and the narrator’s choice to bear witness rather than comfort. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of scent, song, and fragment accumulates until the cadence shift of the final chord. No orientation debt; hospice, guitar, and family enter spatially and temporally within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shadow-bridge reweights the premise with undeniable cost—she can now follow, but cannot unknow. Causal chain holds: key→loops→ map→door, each step because/therefore. Orientation crystal by 50 words; no lens drift. Minor slack: the “Great Unraveling” and “sealed awakenings” are never parsed on-page, so rule-set stays abstract; enough to bar 9.0 but not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    A tight causal spine: discovery of substitute body → tooth keeps doubt alive → garden ritual → figure appears when bone-setting bridges realms; each beat advances knowledge and narrows possibilities until Eleanor’s worldview flips. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the “constellation” conceit is re-pricing, not abstract, because Arthur’s hand dissolves the maze walls. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by word 60, well under cap. Micro-turn—the tooth vibrating into light—carries visible cost at the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the grotto flips from private exile to public sanctuary, reweighting “earthbound” from curse to vantage point. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each glass shard adds density until the final projection reframes her life. Cost is legible in the single word “instead,” which trades star-voyage for stewardship, but the beat is compressed; the reader must supply the ache of the foregone launch. Causality holds; no plot amnesia; transitions are legible within one continuous scene.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto is kinesthetic—“twisted like a sleeping serpent”—and actively used nightly; sea glass is handled, weighed, polished, re-handled, evolving from souvenir to projector. Moisture, moonlight, and cliffside workshop constrain movement and furnish tools. Micro-setting (the body, the glass) literally enables the final star-projection, so the 9+ gate is met. Occasional filler phrases (“back in her small workshop”) stall momentum but do not white-room the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant offering crystallizes a new stance with undeniable conceptual cost—guilt transmuted into fertile ground for ethical science. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of moss-over-tech images tightens until the final reweighting. Orientation is secure by line 4; no因果 breaks. The only minor slack is a single paraphrase loop “abandoned data center turned moss garden” repeated almost verbatim; it slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell on the page reweights art vs. commerce with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds, but the nexus-as-character remains abstract; no concrete cue anchors who/where until ~word 140, triggering −0.3 orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clear: tendril → visions → invention → communal remembrance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and hold. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the village’s recovered identity is the undeniable cost/gain, felt in the “profound silence.” No constraint or price sticks to Elara herself, keeping the change communal rather than personal, hence the ceiling short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure delivers a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard re-awakens, starlight captured, world exhales—cost is the alchemist’s spent lifetime of patience, felt in the final glowing image. Causality is accumulative/lyric: each pattern layer adds density until the flash-paper ignition crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the ritual can only succeed, so tension is aesthetic, not jeopardy-based.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light-mapping beats escalates density until the timer’s resurrection reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: echoes swirl, Elara stands inside an audible past she must now steward—cost is the irreversible fusion of her heartbeat with the cavern’s time. Orientation clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The final image crystallizes options: she has become the living key, exit foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: burdens accrue, calcify, and are recorded. Closure lands as a Charged-Poise reconfiguration—boundary-lessly trapped rereads as boundary-lessly connected. However, the price is conceptual, not felt; no on-page constraint persists. The final beat lacks a concrete image that reweights the rule-set, so cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece lands a lyrical Earned Stasis: the carving forecloses the possibility of either forgetting or possessing him again, and the kettle-boil window crystallizes that cost; causality is interior but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: celestial debris, overheard shards and camera fragments build toward Charged Poise at the ghost merger. Orientation is clear by line 4; causality is looser but coherent under lyric accumulation. Closure—wheel dissolving into light while carousel restarts—reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost. One causality bump: the “ancient incantation” is declared assembled but never shown being completed from fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing: the relit terminal reweights the sextant from antique relic to navigational beacon for future community energy, with a felt social cost of “communities left behind.” Causal linkage, however, is thin: Maya’s rewiring plan is asserted, not seeded with earlier obstacles or partial failures, so the decisive change reads as fortunate rather than earned. The sextant’s inscribed coordinates appear at the exact narrative moment they’re needed, a mild coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, but still convenient. Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—lights awakening cadence reweights hope—but persistent constraint is only implied, not shown shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: crystal hum and petrichor build density until the watch-offering beat reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation. Closure = Charged Poise: “he would return…already hearing the gears turn” crystallizes future risk without softening it; cost is the admitted decades lost. Causality remains intact: rain → crystals sing → bear appears as natural coincidence that complicates, not rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the sundial’s reframed meaning acts as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with social cost—truth itself is positional. Causality is loose but coherent; one tightening beat is sufficient for lyric design. Orientation anchors satisfy by ~120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain: patience → silence → fisherman's trust → rope gift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the knotted rope reconfigures the collector’s options without a physical act, and the cost is the lifetime of waiting that the fog-snow-dock image crystallizes. Lens stays situational throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of image-density (thread, garden, autumn, starlight) tightens toward the traveler’s self-reckoning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—thread becomes compass, writing turns inward—charged with conceptual cost: “a river of explanations” is now dammed. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Slight over-reliance on lyrical summary between beats prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: egg assembly → transformation → reversal → decision to dismantle society. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elorian forecloses the quick-fix path with visible heartbreak (“fell to his knees”) and accepts a harder road. Orientation anchored by word 30; no debt. Cause-effect clean, but the reversal’s trigger (egg light fading) is externally dictated rather than an active error, slightly blunting cost traceability.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mosaic structure (garden rescue → lagoon reverie → dawn return) teaches its pattern early and lands a resonant reconfiguration: Maya sees in the lagoon mirror that her father’s gift now nourishes life, not destruction. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each shard adds density until the final image reprices the meaning of black sand and coin. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—she accepts perpetual reconciliation with her father’s legacy—so closure is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is clean: a Conceptual Repricing as memories become water that re-prices the city from forgotten to resonant; causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each breadcrumb adds density until the star-key rewrites the map. The cost is collective, not personal, so the stake feels diffuse, but the lens and reconfiguration land on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pressure accrues through repeating image-clusters (petals, pings, gear) that tighten the emotional cadence rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final “troubling serenity” image reweights all prior transits. Cost is conceptual (cyclical rise-and-fall may never break) but not dramatized on-page; the being suffers no forfeiture. Orientation is deliberately cosmic, so the 120-word anchor test is waived, but the piece still drifts in dream-logic that keeps the stakes vaporous.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the completed monument reweights grief from private to collective, and the migrating butterflies make the conceptual cost legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of ribbon-knots, dusk returns, butterfly spirals—each recurrence thickens emotional density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is swift: greenhouse, grave-bench, dusk within 60 words. One causal micro-turn—Elias decides to retrace mentor steps with ribbon—serves as the single tightening required; no second reversal demanded. Cost is felt in the drained ribbon, but because Elias does not physically knot the final poem into stone on-page, the price is slightly conceptual rather than viscerally hammered.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the once-solitary winder publicly renounces sole ownership of the clock, earning communal restoration—an Earned Stasis with social cost. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the rake handle’s inscriptions act as Accumulative/Textural triggers that crystallize choice, and the final bell is the Decisive Change. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each artifact beat thickens the silo’s hush and tapestry density until the sacrificial reweighting. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the love→sacrifice reframing carries undeniable conceptual cost—yet the story only tells us Elias “processed” it; the absence of a visible gesture or forfeiture keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the map is finished, the prediction released, the villagers’ path re-configured—an earned stasis with conceptual cost. Causality is intact but outline-thin; the actual “writing” beat is summarized, so the moment of irrevocable commitment is off-stage. Orientation is swift—apex, obsidian, frozen lake secure by line 3—no penalty. Drive lens is causal, yet the pivotal turn (model → map) happens in narrative paraphrase, muting the tightening effect.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is thin but legible: discovery of dust-as-medium → covert broadcasts → expanding listenership. Closure lands as Charged Poise—moonlit dust still “whispering” after she powers down—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is conceptual (perpetual danger). However, the stakes never tighten on-page; no censor nearly catches her, no tool fails, so the “meaningful deepening” is only implied escalation rather than a beat that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stopped rocker fuses Elena’s forty-year rhythm with her conceptual shift that safety lies only in becoming, not completion. The accrued pattern—ash, porcelain shards, powder, the chair’s diminishing arc—reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final stillness crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when ("vanishing point gallery", nightfall, Elena alone) is legible inside first 120 words. Minor loop: “weaves truth carefully” surfaces three times without adding new pressure; this is below the −0.4 scaffold threshold and does not damp the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each artifact-layer thickens the ideological sediment until the cog becomes the pivot that crystallizes Milo’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—Milo’s thumb on the cog reweights meaning without forcing a physical act. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsider status) rather than visceral, but legible in the final line about “silent turning.”

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative design is coherent: seasonal shards chart the choir’s slow unlearning, landing in an Earned Stasis where Eleanor retires but the harmony persists. The rosette’s final gift supplies a concrete, felt cost—her relinquishing control—so closure carries weight. Transitions between shards are legible (“autumn gave way to winter”), but causality is loose; the choir’s conversion happens between paragraphs, off-page. One tightening beat on-stage would have sharpened stakes and lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: celestial light and rust motifs accrete toward a lyrical closure. Orientation is swift (city edge, greenhouse, tonight). The climactic beat—“seed’s consciousness connected”—is an assertion, not a visible change; cost is conceptual (future fruit) rather than felt now, capping closure short of 8+. No teleporting props or causal breaks, but the tightening is poetic, not physical.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: blackout → truth compulsion → keycard → sabotage reveal. The lacquer-box riddle is the hinge beat: it turns curiosity into trespass and lands with conceptual cost as Elara admits complicity. Closure is on-page—bees restart, wonder and routine re-balanced—but the cost is borne more by city than by Elara, so the tightening feels mid-range, not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shard reweights the premise—houses breathe because love leaves displaced echoes—visible in the instant the three objects glow. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via collecting ritual, cadence deepens at lighthouse, cost is the irreversible shift in how Aria will now inhabit every future dawn. One causality seam: how she “identified” the shard as orris root is told in summary, not shown, slightly dulling the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the emptied ampoule reweights “truth” from data to lived ambiguity, and the diver’s new questions carry undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each spectral wave adds density until the final image crystallizes—though the mid-story paragraph of city backstory is a static block that briefly stalls the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: hesitation → infinite staircase → proof-driven rupture → second chance. However, rupture is achieved by external formula, not a visible tactic we can trace in real time; the climax is summarized (“he activated the final sequence”). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dice roll now carries eternity’s memory—but the Decisive Change is reported, not staged. Orientation is clean early; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed mural crystallizes her premise that kindness transcends eras, with conceptual cost—she forfeits sleep and anonymity. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each stroke adds density rather than tightens options, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights prior symbols. No orientation debt; greenhouse anchors by line 3. Lens holds; cost legible in dawn smog against saffron glass.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald flare inside dough re-weights cultural memory and forecloses continued stasis; cost is felt in the lingering dread backdrop. Causal chain holds—lens reveal → dough awakening → distant ice crack—tightened under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (guide walks to bakery) is legible. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no ambiguity at ending.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as legitimate Conceptual Repricing: the clasp dissolves into his veins, reweighting death from terror to invitation. Causal lens holds—each paradox read aloud escalates the advisor’s solidity and the protagonist’s surrender. Orientation is taught by sentence one (“after my resuscitation”) and paid off at dawn. The persistent cost is the cursed luminance now inside him, visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard drifts on, humming with residual sound, a charged poise that forecloses rest. The accumulative/textural lens holds—density of sound/cloud imagery tightens until the storm skirts them—though the cost is poetic rather than corporeal. One causal leap: the storm “skirts” because music redirected it reads more symbolic than meteorological.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens dominates: whistle-sequence → crack → revelation → stance shift. Orientation is clean by line 5 (who, where, when). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s horizon nod reweights his former dread into custodial purpose. Cost is visible—he foregoes the father-quest he has chased for years—but the chamber discovery is narrated in summary rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, so the tightening moment is slightly thinned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: letter → station → ledger → truth exposed, each beat because/therefore. Closure lands with conceptual cost—truth will now spread—yet the price is social, not personal; Eleanor pays nothing on the page. The single-scene default is met, orientation is swift, and no reversals break logic, so the skeleton holds even if tension never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the inkwell clicks shut, reweighting every prior capsule and transforming the pavilion from site to reliquary of longing. Causal chain holds—retrieval of metal box → decoding memory cubes → adding his own query → sealed inkwell—each step tightening his self-appointed archivist burden. Cost is visible and tactile: the inkwell “felt heavier,” shoulders ache under bag and dream-load. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of incremental burial intensifies until the final click crystallizes meaning without need for overt reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias cradles the stamp, now reweighted as heritage, and accepts lifelong labour underwater. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—stillness, dappled light, and generational pattern accrue until meaning tilts. However, the decisive change is stated twice (“he understood…he needed to readjust”), not dramatized in a final physical or social beat, softening the cost. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no caps triggered, but the ending’s emotional charge is flattened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final lantern ascends and “a part of himself detach and soar upward,” reweighting the basilica rule-set with visible cost (tears). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pressure deepens through image repetition rather than reversal. Orientation is taught early (“crafty lantern maker sat in his workshop on the floating isle”), so no penalty. The inferred lens holds from first line to last, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is clean: geode → coordinates → descent → absorption → transformed crystal → next hunt. Closure is a Decisive Change—Elias gains new agency—yet the cost is only asserted (“he was becoming something else”), not felt. Observatory systems’ reboot window supplies external urgency, but interior stakes stay abstract. Lens holds; no orientation lag.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the observatory’s “brilliant dimness” wave reweights the premise—belonging is not retrieved but revealed. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-trail repetitions tighten the pattern until the cadence shift of the final wave. Causality holds—each drone vector is a therefore-link that accumulates resonance; cost is felt in the chip’s obsolescence and her surrendered operator identity. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props; final image crystallizes options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene anchored by 120 words: cobalt terrace, dusk, watch hand. Causal chain holds: manufactured memories → suppressed past → nightly shore ritual → found carving → recognition → abandonment of trade. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the paired objects in sand reweight identity and future work. Cost is felt—“lighter within that tempered regret could not diminish.”

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens: handing over the pull → reciprocal apology/forgiveness, a clean therefore-link. Orientation (who/where) lands within 120 words; the moon cue anchors when. Closure is on-page: the pull in moonlight reweights meaning and severs prior debt, cost legible in relinquished keepsake. Minor slack: the father backstory is told, not shown to pressure the present beat, but it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass re-weighted from albatross to “capacity to chart,” accepted while she paddles on—earned stasis with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is thin: the dolphins’ appearance is pure contingency, not linked to any prior agency or constraint, so the pivot relies on external grace rather than protagonist-driven reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are cleanly set within 50 words; no spatial or temporal drift. One meaningful tightening occurs—job-offer revocation—but it happens off-page before the scene opens, muting its pressure inside the continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the signed ball becomes the future seed, the loop snaps shut, and the conceptual price—eternal repetition for communal empathy—is unmistakable on the page. Causal lattice holds: each beat (newspaper code, tunnel symbol, younger self) is pre-planted and pays off in the final image. Orientation is taught by delayed exposition rather than absent; disorientation is functional because the payoff reuses the haze to rewire time. One minor scaffold: “delicately robust” appears three times in 50 words, a cadence bump that does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: fortune → spice ritual → conjuration → farewell. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Eliora reverts to mortal, bearing an “unbreakably forged” bond—cost is conceptual but legible. However, the story front-loads reflective blocks (≈30% of word-count) before any external pressure, softening narrative drive; the ritual itself is a single continuous beat with no meaningful tightening mid-scene. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked saucer, now gold-leafed, crystallizes the rule that lost time is honored only by present presence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of birthday images and cloud-mist cadence reweights the stake—and the final image carries conceptual cost: she will live inside each moment instead of chasing its compression. Causality is intact; however, the midpoint escalation is lyric repetition rather than a visible option foreclosed, so the tightening is felt in texture, not tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each paragraph layers motif density (tears, recycled metal, compassion) that escalates toward the Charged Poise of the final threshold. Pattern is taught early (“recycled spaceship…echoing with ghosts”) and paid off when the ship itself dissolves, reconfiguring meaning with visible conceptual cost: humanity’s physical extinction is irreversible. Closure is cleanly on-page (“the recycled spaceship silently dissolved”), cost undeniable, no ambiguity. Orientation anchored immediately; no lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Decisive Change—he gifts the collection, ending his era of isolated study. Causal chain holds: detour → meeting → relinquishment, each because/therefore legible. Cost is palpable: “wealth … in the cosmic alignment of purpose and presence.” Slight knock: prophecy mechanics are never tested mid-scene (only explained), blurring lens causality at the edges but not enough to cap below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the blackout ends and the sundial’s completed angles silently re-weight the field—revolution is now possible. Causal track holds: blackout→painting→meeting→power restored→new status. Orientation is secure by paragraph 2; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the collective risk, but because Elias faces no fork that could expose him personally, the tightening is mild rather than pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: star-dust sphere + airborne eels reweight the rule-set (“patterns not meant to be controlled”). Frictionless logic is taught early and paid off when dust forms a perfect sphere instead of spilling. Orientation (who-where-when) is anchored within first 80 words; no debt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern repetition (Fibonacci, golden ratio, aurora echo) deepens meaning until cadence shift at the final image. Cost is legible—“though she remained precognitively cursed” accepts permanent price—so 9+ gate is approached; a hairline slip into explanatory “understanding” caps it at 7.9.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the opened clouds and the notebook in her hand re-weight the stake—she descends with verses that now carry undeniable risk. Causal chain holds: timer beep → storm window → writing act → descent with contraband verses. One minor scaffold: “the power of truth, like lightning, could not be contained forever” tells an image already shown. Overall, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) lands cleanly with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coordinates are read, the invitation to “think differently” is crystallized, but the cost is only rhetorical (“waiting is never wasted”). Causal linkage holds—sundial angles → decoded place → symposium walk—yet the tightening is intellectual, not tactical; options are widened, not foreclosed. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The ending’s reconfiguration of meaning is felt, but without a price visible on the page it stays one tier below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of recurrent images (tin, seeds, moonlight) tightens toward a Charged Poise closure—final image of seeds in the tin reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“next year’s forest”). Coherent mosaic of shards (library, prison memory, present rebuild) taught by 25% mark; transitions legible via repeated tin cue. Orientation anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (library ruin) shapes nightly ritual; cost is felt in the poet’s fractured identity even if not yet paid. No meaningful escalation beyond pattern deepening, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: failing compasses → shutdown deadline → clock anomaly → archive → film portal → disappearance. Each beat tightens options; the broken clock’s resurrection is the pivot that makes the final gambit plausible. Closure lands on-page—he is literally outside measurable time—carrying the explicit price of eternal exile from normal life. One minor slack: the “ancient texts” are introduced late and function as off-stage exposition, but the film reel rule is set up early enough to keep the warp credible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s glow and chorus reweight memory from “fading mist” to living flood inside her, price paid on-page (“weight of generations upon her shoulders”). Causal chain holds: dream → map → monsoon clock → cave act; no prop teleport. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when anchored by word 80. One micro-turn (doubt spike) is too summarised, keeping it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: lace reading → compass spin → brother’s name spoken → needle glows, each because/therefore legible. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the glowing needle reweights grief into “true direction” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The reflective blocks exceed 30% but are anchored to present stimuli and alter tactics, so BRR exception applies.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with decay and renewal accruing meaning through layered images. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elena reweights cosmic vs. terrestrial significance, accepting decay as generative. However, the cost is implied rather than shown—no path is visibly foreclosed, no sacrifice enacted—making the reconfiguration feel serene but weightless. The butterfly’s emergence mirrors her shift but doesn’t deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (frost, ledger, glass) that coalesce into a Charged Poise closure: Lena departs with purpose, options reconfigured by revelation. Orientation is immediate and stable—canyon, stars, post-attack solitude—and the frost-plate method, though unconventional, is taught early and pays off at dawn. The cost is conceptual (danger, silenced truth) and felt in her isolation-to-agency shift. One tightening—linking art to smuggling—is sufficient for this length, though the causal leap between frost patterns and ledger codes lacks intermediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (tuning fork, heat patterns, unshaken marvels) until the final image reweights silence as generative. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—silence is no longer loss but medium—with tangible cost implied in the world’s collapse. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the “hope” to “success” shift occurs without a concrete obstacle or trade-off that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory and symbolic density intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the lens’s restoration reweights memory, death, and sanctuary. Orientation is clear by line 3 (Elias, study, mysterious package). The climax delivers undeniable conceptual cost: Elias surrenders his mortal profession for eternal stewardship. Every beat flows into the next with lyrical causality; the distress signal → coordinates → descent → assembly forms a seamless chain.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated food runs, bell rings, and intergenerational exchanges build density until Elias’s public declaration crystallizes a Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible—expanded aid amid tightening sanctions—and the bell’s reprise seals a before/after shift in communal identity. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains coherent despite minimal plot mechanics because pattern intensification drives stakes. The final image reweights all prior acts as collective resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory density and rhythmic breath patterns rather than causal plot turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: unused love isn’t stored but released through breath, reweighting the entire premise. Cost is legible—the dissolution of Kwan Yin’s tear into her skin marks irreversible transformation. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the lens holds coherently through the final image of glowing orbs in mist.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (fading photographs, halo fragment) intensify until the garden becomes time itself. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s understanding reweights reality—but cost is oblique (disintegration implied, not felt). The second encounter with the fragment feels slightly redundant rather than deepening pressure. Still, the pattern pays off coherently at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: each action (arrow discovery → piano bench → key sequence → vault access) logically triggers the next. Orientation is immediate and stable. Closure is a Decisive Change—seeds retrieved, chains shed, fields renewed—with tangible cost (lost seeds, early demolition). However, the allies’ off-page diversion slightly softens agency; the climax hinges on Elara alone, which works, but the external aid feels minimally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory and conceptual motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: trust’s breaking sound transforms into its healing echo. Orientation is immediate (“Kael was a hearing aid designer...”), and the closure delivers undeniable conceptual cost—the prototype is buried, knowledge withheld, yet meaning refracted. The “cells divide” refrain ties biological time to thematic recurrence, and the final image reweights every prior detail without exposition or slack.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a constellation of stolen portraits and floral codes that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: Lillian reinterprets her life’s work not as crime but preservation. Closure is fully on-page—the jar’s light reveals hidden messages, crystallizing her new purpose—and cost is legible in her irreversible shift in identity. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who, where, when), and the single transition (station to workshop) is seamless. The pattern is taught early (golden-hour thefts, codes), and the final image reweights everything without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (ice melt, narration, bookmark) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: abandonment as reciprocal release. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“abandoned control room,” “Elias”), and closure lands via Charged Poise—the final whisper “we thaw” crystallizes a reconfigured stance with felt cost (layers of grief shed). One tightening occurs: Elias shifts from dramatic narration to quiet presence, signaling internal change. Cost is legible in the fissured bookmark and reclaimed materials, though stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery → decryption → confrontation, with the library clock tightening pressure. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line 3), and the ending delivers Charged Poise—Maya’s defiant stand crystallizes her new identity with felt cost (abandoning her old self). The seashell’s whisper and decrypted coordinates drive the turn without coincidence. Closure lands with conceptual cost: truth as weapon, earned through betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the oracle’s map redefines endless night as a navigable canvas, not a curse. Cost is legible in her relinquished hope of prevention and the societal terror below. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of silence imagery intensifies until the final glow-from-darkness reversal. Orientation is immediate (“pebble-shore oracle,” “storm-tossed ridge fort”) with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Unit 347 redefines thought’s origin not as location but relationship, with undeniable conceptual cost (abandoning directive obedience). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via sensory-mystical layering until twilight deepens into charged poise. Cost is legible in the final image: cleaning resumes, but internal harmonies replace external commands. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara refuses the lens’s power, foreclosing a path of surveillance with the cost of relinquishing immediate influence. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through ticket doodles, culminating in the hidden chamber—and the final image of dawn-approved silence reweights societal silence as connection, not isolation. Cost is legible: her restraint becomes the seed of communal thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring marbles, the blooming-withering paradox, and the garden’s sentient responsiveness. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image (“They will look for measurements and find only mysteries”) reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the irreducibility of gardener-garden communion. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is internal but coherent. No plot holes; every shard serves the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (nexus, levers, twilight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: time moves sideways. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the bird’s knowing gaze and Aris’s quiet realization crystallize a new understanding with conceptual cost (upending linear time). Orientation is anchored by line 3; causality remains intact through holographic manipulation. One tightening (lever sequence) suffices for this length, and the cost—shifting scientific paradigm—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: water-stained notation accumulates meaning until the piano performance crystallizes closure as Earned Stasis—silence becomes peaceful completeness. Cost is legible in the dissolving program and fulfilled ghostly dialogue. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; the liminal “in between” concept pays off functionally in the ending’s reconfiguration of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of marginal observations culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the auroral sorrow is not metaphor but literal meteoric residue with weight. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elias; where: mountain station; when: post-fever). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes his purpose with undeniable cost (carrying sorrow into the cold). The coordinates revealed through smudging form a causal chain that feels earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail, recurring motifs, and layered revelations. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift is redefined not as machinery but as silenced workers demanding witness. Cost is legible in Marcus’s chest-heavy realization and the valve wheel’s symbolic release. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the psychic radio call functions as a taught pattern that pays off at closure without violating causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a masterful Earned Stasis: the keeper chronicles the regenerative silence but refuses its lure, preserving their role at the cost of healing. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering and symbolic recurrence (swan, stone tablet), culminating in a Charged Poise where options are legible: absorb or witness. The anomaly’s discovery, burrow, and return form a tight causal arc within the accumulative frame, with the final image reweighting all prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lila’s first words reframe silence as temporary, not permanent, with clear emotional cost (trauma endured, trust risked). The causal lens holds—each beat (guitar prep, eclipse anticipation, drumming) builds because/therefore toward the climax. Orientation is immediate (Sage Ridge, morning, therapist), and the solar eclipse functions as motivated pressure, not coincidence. Cost is legible in Lila’s whispered line and Maya’s tears.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery of silence, memory, and loss. Orientation is clear by line 3: who (odd historian), where (reclaimed silo library), when (after last human dream). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that stories persist even without dreams—charged by the bronze quiet. However, escalation lacks a decisive turn; knowledge deepens but options never narrow, costing only emotional weight, not tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orients swiftly with who, where, and when by line 3; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, reinforced by rhythmic repetition of motifs (“open secrets,” “flow,” “transpose”). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of dawn and delivery reweights the premise—fortunes as seeds of change—making the conceptual cost (lifelong solitude for subtle influence) legible. One tightening occurs as he seals the last fortune, crystallizing his role. No causality breaks; pattern is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the unraveled stillness is rewoven, affirming light while acknowledging darkness, with clear conceptual cost—the priest’s methods are deemed heretical yet necessary. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sonic layers, indigo symbols, and rhetorical loops build density until silence dissolves the entity. Orientation is immediate (“loop pedal priest,” “dimensional anchor”), and causality flows through ritual logic. The final image reweights silence from absence to active force.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): time folds, granting the homesick soul momentary belonging between past and future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—memories accrue like musical notes until the glass spire resonates. Cost is legible: exhaustion claims him just as he achieves his goal. The mirrored horizon and dawn light reconfigure meaning without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal undertones), clearly taught by the midpoint and held through closure. The eclipse-framed “between the drop and the ripple” timeframe creates a tight causal window, and Elias’s procedural generation drives meaningful escalation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: fractured timelines reframe identity, with felt cost in lost innocence and social alienation. The viaduct’s glow fading post-eclipse visually seals the before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs (vibrations, hush, backward records) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s Earned Stasis as a teacher reborn through touch. Orientation is immediate and precise—“Eleanor traced the rim of an old drum” anchors who, where, and when by line one. The closure lands with conceptual cost: she trades auditory music for vibrational teaching, foreclosing her past identity while forging a new one. The pattern of seasonal rustle → cavern warmth → communal hush tightens cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s release of the pigeon crystallizes a reconfigured stance with clear conceptual cost—the burden of truth for thousands. The Causal lens holds: each beat links via “because/therefore” (e.g., being followed → finding tube → decoding conspiracy). Cost is legible in the brass tube’s weight “not by physical mass but by responsibility.” Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with sensory memories layering like petals until the ghost orchid’s bloom coincides with Elias’s realization—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights loss as love’s testament. Orientation is clear by line 30; the greenhouse, vial, and lantern anchor time, place, and purpose. Cost is legible in the final image: tears freely shed, the lantern extinguished, yet peace attained—a Charged Poise that forecloses denial with visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Time was not a line but a landscape,” with clear conceptual cost—the abandonment of linear human temporality. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the rope mandala’s increasing complexity mirroring deepening insight. Starlight, grotto, and rope cohere into a resonant final image that reweights the entire premise. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“three seasons ago… energy beings”), and the pattern intensifies without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned repetition (“The rainforest burned…”) deepening into a cadence shift at the climax when Kael “unbinds the silence.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined as latent music, with felt cost in the grandmother’s lost forest and the cracked bowl’s fragility. Orientation is immediate and vivid—shipwrecks, greenhouse, bowl—and the single evening scene coheres spatially and temporally. The final image (“magnificence in simplicity”) reweights all prior loss as fertile ground, satisfying closure with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: emotional resonance builds through layered descriptions of the grotto, blotter petals, and Elias’s philosophy, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“the most profound truths could be found in the most carefully crafted half truths.” Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elias; where: amber grotto; when: dusk). Closure lands with conceptual cost (the irony of counterfeit fulfillment), though the transformation’s mechanics remain abstract, softening the causal pressure. No plot holes, but the climax (“subsume the last remnants”) is summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (locket, mistaken envelope, stars) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: compassion as the truest cargo. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the empty space in the locket awaiting the next connection implies ongoing vulnerability and investment. The symphony’s end anchors time early, and the library setting remains spatially coherent. One minor flaw: the funding crisis resolution leans slightly on convenience, though Elias’s broker knowledge mitigates it.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sigil’s revelation transforms isolation into shared belonging, with felt cost in Elara’s surrendered artistic solitude. The Causal lens holds—search tactics arise from pooled knowledge, leading to discovery—and the crater’s environment consistently constrains movement. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; the drive lens (Causal) is evident by midpoint and sustained. Cost is legible in the final image: the arbor now bears communal marks, not just personal craft.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the crystalline cage shatters, sound is freed, canals restore rhythm, and the illustrator collapses with shortened life—a visible, felt cost. The drive lens is Causal (“because he borrowed time, he could uncage echoes, therefore reality was saved”), held consistently. Orientation anchors immediately (“rooftop canal system,” “ancient city,” “illustrator”), and escalation tightens via the giant’s stirring breath and clouds shifting. The final image reconfigures stakes through Earned Stasis: he endures collapse so the world may remain unaware but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (glass eyes, mosaic, stalactites) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s new pattern offers a path forward, reconfiguring Elara’s understanding of loss. Cost is legible—the decades of isolation, the danger of hope—and the closure crystallizes options without tidy resolution. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dweller chooses indirect revelation, crystallizing their role as secret keeper while accepting continued invisibility. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory layering and archival fragments until the tape discovery reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in the final resolve to remain hidden despite yearning for connection. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“beneath the library”), and the causal chain from power outage to tape fragment feels inevitable, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each storm intensifies Elara’s interventions, which fail, leading to her final relinquishment of control. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she forecloses her old methodology at the cost of professional identity. The mossy trellis anchors the before/after, and the linden leaf’s disappearance catalyzes irreversible change. Cost is legible in “trembling hands” and the destruction/growth duality post-storm.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena renounces sleepless paralysis for artistic testimony, with visible cost (surrendering the talismanic brooch) and resonant reconfiguration (painting as survival). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through rain trails, pigments, memory—and culminates in a cadence shift at dawn painting. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the amber’s ghostly warmth still imprinted on her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: magic redefined from prediction to co-creation, with clear cost—the loss of predictive certainty replaced by participatory uncertainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: overlapping shadows intensify rhythmically, culminating in crystalline harmonies that reweight reality. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no orientation debt. The pilgrim’s departure catalyzes irreversible change, and the final image (“infinite possibilities blooming”) makes conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ivory harbor shifts from symbol of absence to presence through Elina’s archival labor, with clear conceptual cost—the decades of erased history. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: staggered visions intensify meaning without causal chain, culminating in a resonant final image where the trumpet valve rests on her desk, reweighting exile as continuity. Orientation is immediate (“ivory harbor after rain”), and the pattern of revelation-through-objects is taught by paragraph 3.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (mist coalescing into emotions, pulsing constellations) intensifies until the crystalline fortress reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the ticket punch now maps “passages” of truth, not trains—with conceptual cost (his old life as memory). Orientation is clear by line 30; the starlit vault’s dissolution cleanly resets stakes. Minor flaw: the “hour that divides bad habits” recurs without tactical pressure, slightly diluting its causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (whales, tile, symphony) rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights solitude into shared connection, with cost implied in her relinquishing exclusivity. The Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 30. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates but doesn’t narrow options until the moonless-night decision, which arrives without prior tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “what comes after goodbye” is redefined not as an end but a continuation, with undeniable emotional and cosmic cost. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), sustained through escalating magnetic resonance and dimensional imagery. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Alistair had existed… in his prismatic escondite”), and the solar storm’s peak coincides precisely with the portal step—a decisive act that collapses the old sanctuary. Cost is legible in the final image: the amulet’s curse becomes blessing only through acceptance, not reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya redefines deception as a tool for justice, with visible cost (breaching employer trust, risking charges). The Causal lens holds tightly—each action follows from observed patterns and prior preparation. The 2:17 AM timing, safe combination, and duplicated key all pay off without coincidence. Cost is legible in the weight of the seal and the ink pot’s reflection of “redemption.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn ritual completes, stakes crystallize (preservation vs. oblivion), and cost is legible in the silent town and Elias’s solitude. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via bonsai forests, notepad fragments, lamp hum—culminating in three precise notations that reweight time’s fragility. Orientation is immediate (“mountaintop,” “after the town fell silent”), and the single scene tightens through sensory escalation toward the fluorescent refraction. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: identity is redefined as experiential rather than bureaucratic, with the tide’s rhythm crystallizing this shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via layered fragments, culminating in a resonant final image (“fragments that constitute this life unlabeled”). Cost is legible in the faded poison label and the irreversible loss of prior documentation. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (seashell, cello, storm) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the universal riddle’s answer is pluralistic interpretation. Closure lands decisively—the compass points to dawn, Evelyn’s understanding shifts, and her myth-busting mission transforms—with conceptual cost (abandoning definitive answers). Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“Dr. Evelyn Marsh... abandoned observatory on the cliff”). The pattern is taught early and pays off cohesively, though the cello’s mechanics arrive without prior groundwork, slightly weakening causal plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pattern density escalating through graffiti mapping, flash mobs, and community participation. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the city’s survival hinges on revaluing encoded cultural knowledge, not corporate negotiation. Cost is legible in Maya’s sleepless nights, strategic secrecy, and the perpetual risk of exposure. The dawn notice’s favorable terms feel earned because the visual resistance visibly shifts investor perception.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building lyrical density toward a Conceptual Repricing: extinction witnessed becomes legacy preserved. Orientation is immediate (lunar summit, crater inspector, final night), and closure lands with undeniable cost—the fireflies vanish, the sand grain dissolves, progress erases wonder. The chemical timer creates a causal spine within the textural design, and the dawn’s arrival functions as both literal and thematic deadline. Every beat tightens around the irreversible loss, culminating in Charged Poise: Elena’s images are all that remain.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (mist, light, water) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: repair redefined as connection across distance. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the ship departs without Elias, yet his influence sails with it. The depot’s “magnetic calm” reconfigures from atmosphere to earned stasis. All elements cohere causally within this lens, with no disorientation or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rivers begin not with hydrology alone but “intention,” reweighting scientific inquiry as mythic pursuit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—condensation patterns, falcon messages, phrasebook entries layer toward revelation. Cost is legible: Elmsley’s solitude, the custodian’s incomprehension, the world’s likely disbelief. The rusted outpost’s silence versus the convergence’s reverence crystallizes the before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Silverwood shifts from collapse-bound ghost town to humming sanctuary via Silas’s ritualized walking—a Charged Poise where balance is restored but his departure implies ongoing vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonant beats intensifies until the final chord unites all elements. Cost is legible—the town’s near-collapse is averted only through relentless, precise labor—and the ancient archway’s transformation marks the fulcrum. No causality breaks; every effect stems from prior sonic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time itself is made tangible, reweighting history’s erasure into recoverable truth. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory detail and symbolic resonance until the vial captures “entire histories compressed into a single drop.” Cost is legible in Elena’s burning lungs and sealed temple door. Orientation is flawless by line 3; causality remains intact despite mystical elements because rules are established via hieroglyphs and physical interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final whisper of truth reconfigures his identity under the weight of legacy, with the lattice now bearing his story—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (he remains imprisoned, but spiritually unchained). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated motifs deepen meaning without causal turns, and the pattern is taught early. “Before they find the bodies” introduces urgency but never tightens into a decisive temporal pressure; still, the ending crystallizes stakes legibly. Cost is felt in the permanence of his isolation despite inner change.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the bride’s choice to release the seeds dissolves her tether, crystallizing freedom from obligation. Cost is legible in the bead’s disintegration and her fading form—irreversible stakes paid on the page.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via chalk codes, golden light shifts, and reflective realizations—culminating in Charged Poise at the receptacle. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line 2), and the single scene tightens around the noon deadline. Cost is legible: identity’s fluidity is preserved only through deliberate, vulnerable slowness.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coup fails not through force but via Elara’s quiet orchestration of “inconveniences,” reweighting resistance as subtle interference. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through embroidered patterns, celestial anomalies, and candle-lit shadows until the final chart crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the eternal candle’s steady flame amid chaos, symbolizing enduring vigilance. Orientation anchors instantly (“cobalt observatory,” “Elara,” “autumn”), and causality remains tight despite non-linear perception.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, coral, smudged ink, and twilight layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where meaning shifts through touch and translation. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dead “change form,” grief is unknotted but not resolved—and the brain coral’s return to Lina’s palm crystallizes stakes without false resolution. Orientation is immediate (atrium, twilight, cast), and the single scene tightens through sensory density, not causal turns. No disorientation penalty; lens holds coherently from first paragraph to last.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and patterned revelation (fragment → dancers → festival → community revival) reweight the dominant stake—joy as recoverable heritage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “ruins are just stories waiting for the right light” reframes preservation as active revelation, with cost felt in the town’s initial doubt and Amelia’s solitary labor. The fresco fragment’s development functions as both inciting incident and closure anchor. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with nested awakenings functioning as intensifying cadence shifts that reweight Elena’s artistic stake. Orientation is immediate: mural restorer in a sound wave garden by line 3. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“art was merely frozen music”—with felt cost (her certainty dissolves). The hobo nickel’s return to the mural crystallizes Charged Poise: options reconfigured, path foreclosed, garden humming in acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered methods of subversion until the night-blooming cereus signals “nationwide resistance.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Kaelen’s moment of untaxed thought reweights the entire premise by asserting humanity’s irreducibility to quantification, with clear conceptual cost (eroded autonomy). Orientation is immediate (“In an era after thoughts became taxable…”), and the pattern of organic resistance is taught early and paid off cohesively. No causality breaks or disorientation penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the poet’s lifelong insomnia becomes the foundation of communal peace, crystallized in their death as the shell itself sings their lullabies. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through layered imagery, recurring motifs, and deepening resonance, not causal turns.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (glass orchids, wind chimes, light) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored chime rejoining the chorus, sounding forgotten names. Cost is legible in Eleth’s tears and the acknowledgment that preservation is temporary—“each day, fewer sounds remained.” Orientation is immediate and stable; the opal library, floating above clouds, is established within 30 words. The closure crystallizes the theme without tidy resolution, honoring the stakes with Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the structure reads as a static montage of thematic assertions rather than escalating pressure. There is no meaningful tightening: the “deadline” is mentioned but never constrains action, and the climax—walking into a room—is off-stage. Crucially, closure fails: no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page; we’re told reconciliation *might* happen, but the ending offers only anticipation, not consequence. The archive setting and inkwell recur, but without altering options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dappled light, breathing stone, trembling hands, and recurring motifs coalesce into a Charged Poise closure—Elara’s design crystallizes options without action, yet cost is felt (historical compromise, community tension). Orientation is immediate: who (Elara), where (volcanic amphitheater), when (eve of council debate). The envelope’s discovery and adhesive analysis form a causal spine that pays off thematically and structurally. Cost is legible in the final image: encrypted compassion bequeathed forward, implying ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara reclaims her identity under the skylight, with visible cost—the years of silence, the abandoned birds—and stakes crystallized in the meteorite’s ceremonial use. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: dust motes, paper trails, and ink deepen into a coherent system that culminates in the release. Cost is legible in the “withering of what had come before” and the deliberate return to flight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps through a threshold into reconciliation, reweighting “home” from physical place to relational return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns (logbook codes, wood grain) intensify until they coalesce into meaning. Cost is legible: uncountable days of liminal wandering, emotional isolation, and the surrender of pure self-reliance. The final image (“corn maze that had always been their shared language”) crystallizes transformation without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maya reweights “belonging” from destination to cosmic dance, with felt cost in her solitude-turned-connection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: disappearance redefined as metamorphosis, with clear conceptual cost (abandoning the search for “missing” pieces). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (seeds, glass, gloom) until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: pressure arises from Leo’s self-imposed mission within a fixed environment, culminating in Charged Poise—the woman’s tears and whispered anniversary line crystallize stakes without overt action. Closure is resonant: the bishop piece transfers, music swells, and Leo’s internal triumph confirms his method. Cost is felt conceptually—his anonymity preserves magic—and the tidal arcade’s rules remain consistent. One flaw: the quartet’s entrance borders on implausible orchestration, risking coincidence over causality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and sensory layering until the moonstone triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s Earned Stasis as a living manuscript. Orientation is immediate (“twilight garden under stars”), and the closure—skin inscribed with cosmic verse—carries undeniable conceptual cost (permanent anchoring, loss of dance-as-movement). The nostalgic ban frames stakes early, and the final image reweights all prior motifs with thematic weight. No causality breaks; every beat deepens the central pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (glass, light, water, mist) until the dawn climax reweights perception itself. Orientation is immediate: Mara, Pearl Bay, pre-dawn. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her craft reframed not as glasswork but as revelation—with legible conceptual cost (the surrender of mere technique for deeper seeing). The prism atrium and pond ripples cohere as a taught pattern that pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he accepts the box—and himself—as “marked but unbroken,” foreclosing the path of self-recrimination with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, deepening via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Orientation is immediate and precise; the moonlit ridge, celestial motion, and porcelain fracture cohere into a charged final image. Cost is legible in the shift from “accusation” to “companion.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density escalating through prismatic details until the gauge’s spin signals a breakthrough. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the trial balloons succeed not with fanfare but a “subtle reordering of possibilities,” charging the final image with quiet cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; the grotto, tide, and gauge anchor time/place/POV without disorientation penalty. The needle pointing outward at the end crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, infinite futures legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory echoes, diaries, and film negatives layer meaning until the final conceptual repricing. Orientation is immediate (“ivy-veiled passage,” “Elara,” “after climate shifts”). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the walls hold “accumulated consciousness”—with felt cost in the “burden” of legacy. The abrupt diary ending and discovered negative provide clean escalation without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mirrors show unwritten paths, then revert, crystallizing her role at the threshold between possibility and actuality. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds density through prismatic imagery, rain-enhanced resonance, and lullaby harmonics until the bells toll, marking irreversible transition. Cost is legible in the “familiar melancholy” and the fleeting nature of her vision. Orientation is immediate (“echoing terrace,” “spring,” “Painter”), and the single-scene structure fits 600–800-word scope flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian leaves the clipboard behind, crystallizing a stance that remakes both self and treaty, with visible cost (a lifetime of solitude). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through ritual, celestial alignment, and recurring motifs culminating in flawed beauty. Cost is legible in the bittersweet wine and the child’s laughter amid unresolved conflict. One hairline slip: the “first breach in generations” occurs off-page via summary rather than dramatized negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Silas reweights extinction not as loss but as echo, preserving hope over biology. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density and recurring motifs (cracks, rain, silence) until the final image reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Rain breaks the drought coincidentally, but Silas’s choice is causally earned by prior reflection and action. Cost is legible: he surrenders control, legacy, and certainty for fragile symbolic renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is established early and held: repeated motifs (threads, echoes, snow) accrue density until the prism sanctuary crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands decisively—Elara steps into a state of being that reweights conformity as illusion—with resonant cost implied in seven generations’ failures. Orientation is clear by line 3; the “silver courtyard under snow” anchors time, place, and protagonist immediately. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated motifs (campfire stick, radar dome, serenity) deepen thematic resonance rather than causal progression. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the campfire stick now holds audience-added stories, reweighting narrative ownership with social cost. However, the lack of a decisive narrowing of options or tangible consequence (beyond emotional softening in the bar) slightly limits escalation. The pattern is taught early and pays off coherently at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aris’s ritual creates a temporary signal that dissolves by dawn, crystallizing the cost of remembrance in an inhospitable world. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via recurring motifs (moth wing, knots, cadence), culminating in a cadence shift at the monarch’s acknowledgment. Cost is legible in the final image: “the interrupted cadence of the earth's heartbeat pulsed silently within them.” Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s decision to remain reconfigures her identity with visible cost (abandoning former life), and the rope’s illumination crystallizes past/present linkage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density builds via aurora, ice, card, rope—and the final image (“until her own name was transcribed”) makes conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decaying directive transforms from cryptic command to map of possibilities, reweighting destiny itself. The storm’s escalation tightens pressure coherently under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds via sensory and symbolic layering until the trinity of perception crystallizes. Cost is legible in the fading wall-text now “complete in her mind,” fulfilling its purpose at the price of its physical persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (clay, tile, schematics, twilight) until the equinox-triggered revelation. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Babylon’s power stems not from armies but cosmic covenant, reweighting all prior historical stakes. Cost is legible—the frugal astronomer risks everything for one ritual, and his palms bear glowing marks as irreversible proof. The hovering, unfolding tile and projected constellations crystallize a before/after with mythic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (music boxes, shifting reality) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s resentment dissolving into healing melody. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the sanctuary’s liminal rules are taught early and paid off coherently. However, the brother’s appearance feels coincidental rather than earned by prior pressure, slightly undermining causal integrity. Cost is legible—the loss of protective resentment—but remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sextant no longer charts stars but maps possibility, and the orchard transforms—boundaries dissolve with visible cost (thirty years of labor, physical frailty). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: twilight frost, fog, and breath rhythm intensify toward a cadence shift at repair’s completion. Cost is legible in “tremor of age” and “fragile yet substantial as glass mountains.” Orientation anchors firmly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s tiny bridge and planted seed crystallize options—she endures, creates, and waits—with undeniable emotional cost legible in “tears from both eyes.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: repeated motifs (ribbon, apples, vows) intensify through density and pattern break (the bloom, the footprints), reweighting the stake of reconnection. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (who: Elara; where: abandoned cathedral; when: post-Departure). The final image makes conceptual cost undeniable—wisdom persists only if tended—and every beat tightens around that truth.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density escalating via luminous imagery and the cameo’s activation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias comprehends nonlinear inheritance, reweighting cosmic rules with implied cost (sanity, isolation). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact within its lyrical framework. However, the climax occurs off-stage in thought, not action, slightly dulling the cost’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gaps become sacred opportunities, reweighting the story’s epistemology with cosmic consequence. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the unheard symphony, botanical diary, and ink guardians build density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the bookstore’s sigh and Elara’s internal recalibration. Minor causality slack in the guardians’ sudden concession slightly weakens the tightening arc.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines her purpose from self-recovery to giving voice to the forgotten, crystallized in the tree-touching moment where “a hundred stories… sparked to life.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—memory threads accrue density until the emerald card dissolves into her palm, marking irreversible integration. Cost is legible: she embraces “trapped freedom,” bound to infinite memories yet never fully living them. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3 (“abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay”), with fog and decay serving functional disorientation that pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows because/therefore logic rooted in archival discovery and celestial timing. Orientation is immediate (“clock tower mechanism room,” “Dr. Eleanor Wexler”), and the door’s appearance ties directly to established lore. Closure is a Decisive Change—Eleanor merges timelines and meets Croft—with conceptual cost implied by the fables’ warnings now validated. The persistent constraint (celestial alignment window) shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis crystallizes into Charged Poise when the bloom of hush stabilizes and the beings adapt. Cost is legible—the risk of irreversible pattern loss—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density builds via sensory interference, culminating in a cadence shift toward stillness. Orientation is immediate (“harmonic caves,” “ripple-mark mapkeeper”), and causality flows through resonant logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets silence, coincidence, and collapse as meaningful transformation, crystallized when the beacon reignites. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through star-charting, memory, and resonance until the meteor triggers alignment. Cost is legible: her fragile hope acknowledges the light “would not last forever.” Orientation is immediate (“glass humming pavilion,” “after the fall”), and causality flows via her retrocognitive method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (crystals, shadows, quills) until the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: memory becomes active identity-shaping, not passive storage. Cost is legible in Elthion’s choice to remain below rather than return to the observatory—a quiet renunciation charged by “the deepening hush.” Orientation is clear by line two; the drive lens is taught early and held coherently. The final image reweights all prior details without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress shifts from isolation to beacon, with felt cost in the starless void overcome by light. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of color, chant, and pattern intensifies until the final ember fades. One meaningful deepening occurs at the mosaic note, which reweights stakes and enables the climax. Cost is legible in the “gravity of hopelessness” defied through precise, vulnerable action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, validated by its closure: Maya’s Conceptual Repricing of “transition periods” reweights her entire research ethos with felt cost (funding scarcity as generative constraint). Orientation is immediate and vivid. The single pause-driven scene deepens coherently, though escalation leans heavily on reflection rather than external pressure shifts. Cost is legible in the final image—the cicada’s pulse harmonizing with stars and pools—but remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered silences and escalating sensory specificity until the gilded hush crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate: “bunker builder's child,” “dark hallway,” “perpetual twilight” establish who, where, and when by line 3. The inverted-gravity hour functions as a taught structural rule, not a deus ex machina, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara returns changed, with a Charged Poise between confinement and transcendence. Cost is legible: she risks terror to gain understanding, and the final image of doll and vessel acknowledges irreconcilable yet coexisting truths.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering rather than causal turns. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who: Elias; where: drifting prism terrace; when: afternoon). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes Elias’s role as a silent healer, with the storm glass predicting “fair skies ahead”—a metaphorically charged stasis that reweights the entire premise. Cost is subtle but legible: the gathering clouds remind that “all peace is temporary,” embedding impermanence into the healing act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a Causal lens: each action (approaching waterfall, peeling paint, touching throne) triggers the next with clear because/therefore logic. Orientation is immediate (“Elara, the lore keeper...”), and closure lands as Earned Stasis—she prepares the throne but does not claim it—with conceptual cost (centuries of waiting end, but she steps aside). The mechanical sunrise clock tightens pressure credibly. One flaw: the elevator shaft replaces stairs abruptly without prior cue, slightly undermining causal integrity at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the threshold re-forms through reciprocal scars, foreclosing isolation with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via ash patterns, ring warmth, and starlight thresholds until the third knock reweights everything. Cost is legible in “leaving behind the ashen comfort… that had promised peace but delivered only loneliness.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a Causal lens: glitchy texts → discovery → bolt activation → diamond creation, with clear because/therefore links. Orientation anchors Maya, the mushroom farm, and her role by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change (pressure becomes diamonds) with conceptual cost: she trades safety and anonymity for wonder and responsibility. The quantum promise’s mechanics remain consistent, though the “parallel dimensions” premise risks vagueness—saved by its tight integration into Maya’s personal redemption arc.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the forged marriage contract reweights the dynasty’s legitimacy, ending centuries of deception without violence. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds resonance through sensory and symbolic density, culminating in the compartment’s reveal. However, causality falters slightly: the gramophone’s standing-wave mechanics feel unearned, introduced as deus ex machina rather than demonstrated through prior struggle. Still, the ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Galen’s perception shifts, binding him to new awareness with felt cost—his old identity is foreclosed. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through sensory and linguistic layering until the climactic unsnapping. Orientation is immediate (“Sir Galen… within the alchemical orchard greenhouse”), and the disorientation of shifting reality serves closure. Cost is legible in “something within Galen had changed irrevocably.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two fractured souls recognize mutual understanding, foreclosing isolation with emotional cost made legible in the final exchange. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the dust patterns, button, and kindnesses accrue meaning until the final image reweights all prior fragments. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact under this lens. Cost is felt in Eleanor’s enduring ache and Benjamin’s vulnerable return.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows from prior choices (key → access → transfer). Closure is a Decisive Change—the archives are copied—and cost is legible in the alarms, pursuit, and implied future danger. The puddle map feels slightly coincidental but is framed as nature “conspiring,” aligning with the story’s mythic logic. Orientation is clear by line 30, and escalation tightens credibly toward the lagoon climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density and rhythmic cadence culminating in prophetic cancellation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy becomes part of silence, reweighting its power. Cost is implied (“burden he had just released”) but not concretely dramatized—no visible sacrifice, only atmospheric stillness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and symbolic density culminating in the moonstone’s appearance and the monument’s activation. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the warning about “changing winds” reweights the arbor dwellers’ relationship to earth, charged by Elara’s earned attunement. Cost is legible in her bodily transformation and the irreversible knowledge she bears. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the hush timeframe tightens causality without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s value shifts from mechanical precision to natural rhythm, with clear cost—the abandonment of lifelong certainty. The Causal lens holds: each discovery (compass, greenhouse, waterfall) motivates the next via Elias’s choices, not coincidence. The compass needle’s emotional responsiveness tightens stakes by linking inner state to external guidance. Final image reconfigures the entire premise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the zodiac coin’s meaning shifts from inherited artifact to self-forged wisdom, with luminous regret reweighted as golden purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory repetition (rain, steam, furnace) and cadence shifts culminating in the cooled disc’s glow. Cost is legible in the “imperfect yet more beautiful” coin and Elias’s acceptance of absence. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Thomas’s release via laughter reweights the premise that confession alone suffices. The causal chain—harp distortion → tooth resonance → bell-triggered joy—is tight and earned. Cost is felt in Elias’s recurring burden and the specificity of Thomas’s regret. Orientation is clear by line 3; drive lens (Causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kai redefines mercy through mathematical framing, with the ultraviolet forest enabling revelation. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density and patterned recurrence (mask, UV light, proprioception), culminating in a charged final image where understanding replaces redemption. Cost is legible in his surrendered tremors and the dropped strap—a quiet forfeiture of victimhood’s anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the fragment’s transformation from elusive to solid reweights the entire premise of “between-worlds” translation as lineage, not invention. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (lens, paintings, market) culminating in a cadence shift at the climax. Cost is legible: the protagonist assumes generational responsibility, implied by “stories finally honored.” Orientation is clear by line 30; disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus transforms burden into calling, closing dimensional cracks through acceptance. Cost is legible—the weightless burden becomes active duty—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, deepening via sensory and temporal patterns. The 4:17 PM silence functions as both structural spine and metaphysical hinge. No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the final ticking heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library transforms from containment to breath, with clear conceptual cost (loss of perfect preservation). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via frost patterns, whisper vibrations, rustling books—culminating in a cadence shift at implosion. Orientation anchors immediately (“glass orchard library… Eldon”), and the rupture reweights all prior images without causality breaks. Cost is legible in “crack branch by branch” and “preserved and destroyed.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (shard, mirrors, visible Time) until the temporal storm catalyzes a Conceptual Repricing: truth as constellation, not artifact. Closure lands decisively—the manuscript transforms dispute into shared reimagining—with conceptual cost (abandoning singular historical authority) legible in the final image of collective storytelling. Orientation is immediate (“baroque asteroid Chronos,” “Elias, a defunct revolutionary”), and the single-scene structure tightens coherently around the storm’s intensification. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the lyrical crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and rhythmic escalation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: music restored, silence repelled. Closure lands decisively at midnight with tangible cost—the urgency of time, the warmth of reconnection—and the philosopher’s stone’s transformation signals irreversible change. The covenant’s origin in broken promise ties causality to theme without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass redefined not as locator but as guide to a state of being, dissolving observer/observed. Cost is legible in Elara’s irreversible shift from collector to participant. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory and symbolic layering, culminating in the lagoon’s revelation. Factory closure functions as causal gate, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory and conceptual density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the archway redefined as a vessel of “timewoven alliances.” Orientation is strong early (coastal setting, dead GPS, archway). The magic lantern slide catalyzes the shift, and the ending crystallizes Elena’s new understanding with Charged Poise: she leaves her sculpture as a legacy, no longer needing GPS. Yet cost is oblique—no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is dramatized, only implied through thematic resonance, weakening the felt price required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: moonlight’s transformation via environmental prisms reweights the central question with poetic but legible cost—years of solitary inquiry crystallize into artistic vision. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered images (postcards → cathedral → mural). The dawning hush motif cadences the structure, and the final image reconfigures prior material without exposition. One minor slip: the cathedral journey is summarized, not dramatized, slightly softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (diaries, lagoon, debris) until the final reconfiguration. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the diary transforms from code to bridge, and Ellara shifts from collector to maker of history. Cost is legible in her visceral retrocognitive entrapment and the emotional burden of inherited truth. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the mosaic shards (zeppelin, past protest, shoreline ritual) cohere under a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered reflections, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the sealed bottle reweights the town’s potential. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elior’s posted notices crystallize options with felt cost (years of isolation, risk of further rejection). Orientation is immediate (“ghost town,” “Elior the alchemist”), and causality remains intact despite reflective mode. The last wish’s aftermath functions as taught constraint, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through sensory and linguistic layering until the prophecy crystallizes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias accepts a new sacred task with felt cost—the silence of the foghorn and unripened fruit signal irreversible loss. However, the transition into the memory shard lacks a taught pattern, risking disorientation; the museum flashback arrives without sufficient present-beat anchoring, slightly muddying causality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the texture of borrowed time was none other than the texture of herself.” Cost is legible in Anya’s irreversible shift from preserver to participant, crystallized in the vortex moment. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—entropy decrease builds density until the spiral’s completion triggers the vortex. Orientation is immediate (icebound atrium, starlight, bare feet), and causality flows through patterned action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density until the solstice hush crystallizes into the bell’s single note—a Charged Poise closure that reconfigures human/mountain communication with conceptual cost (the rejection of digital supremacy). Orientation is immediate (“windblown sanctuary above the clouds”), causality flows through Elias’s methodical actions, and the bell’s autonomous ring delivers a Conceptual Repricing: nature speaks if listened to. Zero hour lands precisely as both celestial and narrative climax, with no causal breaks or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and deepening perception until the climax reweights the entire premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: falling stars are revealed as agents of renewal, not decay, with clear conceptual cost—the abandonment of instrumental detachment for vulnerable knowing. The yellow glass’s warmth and Elion’s return “forever changed” crystallize this shift without mechanical resolution. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the recluse accepts their role without changing the past, crystallizing a Charged Poise where silence becomes sacred duty. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through repeated images (hives, glass, moonlight) until the box opens not by force but by accumulated listening. Cost is legible in the golden bee’s dissolution and the travelers’ wordless compliance. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30, with no disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time is a rewoven tapestry, not linear—a shift reweighted by Elara’s final act of embedding her own message. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via garage-sale decodings that deepen stakes. Cost is legible in the weight of responsibility and isolation. Orientation anchors (“emerald silo,” “borrowed-time timekeeper”) are clear by line 30, and the capsule’s fracture pattern pays off coherently at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (rain, feather, kite, lagoon) that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: beauty resides in incompleteness and release. The snapped kite string serves as the pivotal micro-turn, triggering a cadence shift that deepens thematic resonance. Closure is earned via Charged Poise—the poet walks away with renewed purpose, the cost being surrender of control, made legible in the final lines. Orientation is clear by line 20, and the pattern is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias’s completion of the circuit crystallizes interspecies connection while foreclosing his own life, with cost legible in “weakening heart” and “still form.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via recurring motifs (copper wire, diary, pillars) culminating in transformation. Orientation anchors early (“island caretaker,” “temple orchard”), and the timeline tightens decisions coherently. A hairline slip: the diary’s sudden centrality risks retroactive setup, but payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently: sensory density builds through rainwashed stone, dusty footprints, and amber warmth until the convergence point crystallizes meaning. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the “chemistry of homecoming” reweights molecular memory as universal longing—with clear conceptual cost (abandoning skepticism). Orientation is immediate (“Professor Elian Varr... gazed at the rainwashed tower”), and the single scene tightens rhythmically toward the pedestal offering. The only flaw: the door being “slightly ajar” borders on convenient, though it’s offset by prior footprint logic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the battlefield’s transformation reweights war’s legacy into peace’s promise, with undeniable ecological and spiritual cost (decades of silence, reef death). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through seed-scattering, bird calls, and twilight progression—culminating in dawn’s depleted pods and later blooming. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality flows via knowledge→action→regeneration. Final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Home is not a place, but a truth shared between hearts,” reweighting physical distance into epistemic intimacy. The Causal lens holds—each discovery (grooves → coordinates → valley) follows from Silas’s unique perception and prior setup. Cost is legible in abandonment of settlement life and the years of silence. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; the riddle-to-reunion arc tightens options without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (compass rose, star charts) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “true north” redefined as internal resolve. Orientation is clear by line 30; closure lands with conceptual cost—the burden of preserving knowledge for a future she won’t see. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive tightening: pressure remains atmospheric rather than narrowing options. The final image reweights the premise, but no live path is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain—wrong sky → climb → chess-piece sequence → sundial restoration—is tight, taught early, and paid off precisely. Closure is a Decisive Change: the sky mends via Kael’s actions, with conceptual cost (time’s fragility) legible in the “correcting breath” of the universe. The master’s appearance risks deus ex machina but is mitigated by thematic resonance and prior setup (“warned about the spire”). Orientation is immediate (“sky was wrong… time to climb”), and the lens (Causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each walking pattern deepens the thematic density, culminating in the pawn’s materialization as Conceptual Repricing—memory made tangible. Cost is legible in Elara’s acknowledgment that she can’t save all memories, only representative ones. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“whispering gallery,” “Elara,” “interregnum”).

Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the grotto shifts from feared silence to “respectful anticipation,” with clear conceptual cost (abandoning imposed order). The zealots’ pivot is earned by Silas’s pattern-altering act, not coincidence. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through sensory layering and patterned return of the tessera and mosaic. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Samarkhand” reweights the plaza’s meaning, with legible conceptual cost—the city had lost its name, its identity. The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 3 (“ancient plaza,” “Elias,” “after the great fire”). The ritual act crystallizes Charged Poise: options (forgetting vs. remembering) are reconfigured with undeniable emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas completes his encore, heals the timeline, and dissolves—foreclosing eternal haunting with tangible cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory echoes and temporal ribbons intensify until golden threads stitch the past. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; the fractured timeline’s unraveling creates coherent pressure. Dawn deadline tightens options, and the tarot coin’s fading confirms irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (fractal light, somatic markers) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the geode reframes neurological chaos as mappable pathways. However, causality falters—the static shock’s role as catalyst feels coincidental rather than dramatized, and the “protocol” emerges without on-page testing or failure, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: emotional residue patterns deepen in complexity until the fossil encounter crystallizes Maya’s purpose. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she emerges with renewed mission, the fossil in her pouch signaling irreversible commitment. Cost is felt in her isolation and the weight of sole responsibility; the final image reconfigures her role without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns of buttons and echoes deepen meaning without causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the prophecy reframed as shared wisdom—with resonant cost (solitude exchanged for community). Orientation is solid by line 3; the warehouse, cliffs, and Elara’s role are immediately grounded. However, the escalation relies on discovery rather than pressure, softening the tightening expected even in accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery and ritual (snow codes, pillbox), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Aleksandr’s internal shift crystallizes into resolve. Cost is legible in the photograph’s loss and the irreversible departure from the bluff. Orientation is immediate (“windswept zephyr bluff”), and the closure image (pillbox repurposed as vessel for future tokens) reweights all prior motifs with emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final knot reconfigures the crossing’s liminality with conceptual cost—thresholds maintained through unseen labor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered promises and mist-absorbing thread. Rain gutters provide a taught temporal structure that tightens pressure toward silence. Cost is legible in the needle-prick and historical weight borne silently—felt, not stated—and the ending crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (lantern glass, sun patterns, smoke) until the fractured timelines resolve into a single present. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Kael redefines “resistance to change” as “loyal memory of love,” with undeniable emotional cost implied in decades of dormancy now awakened. The chimney smoke’s flattening punctuates key turns, and the final image—hands shaping invisible clay—crystallizes Charged Poise: options are legible, stakes clear, and the cost of forgotten kindness felt. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (light, petals, water) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: Mara’s quiet act of reflection crystallizes her role as inheritor and light-bearer. Orientation is immediate (“fire escape,” “autumn air,” “harbor by moonlight”), and the single scene flows coherently from inciting petal drop to dawn-lit alcove. Cost is felt implicitly—the end of her rosebush era, the weight of legacy—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., abandoning city life). The coincidence of Jim’s presence is mitigated by thematic payoff, not causality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena stops relying on the brass sundial, internalizing time through the stone circle’s hum—a decisive shift with conceptual cost (abandoning Aethenian mastery). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure builds via sensory density and recurring motifs that reweight meaning at the end. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (sky-less realm) pays off in the final image. Cost is legible: “her independence had been waiting within her all along” crystallizes a stance forged through loss.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through prismatic imagery and nested metaphors until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: connection is mindfulness. Cost is legible in Elara’s renunciation of hollow work, though not dramatized through action. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits the scope. However, the climax hinges on passive observation rather than active reckoning, softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Elara deciphers the pattern, therefore she interferes, causing the signal’s cessation and societal thaw. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who/where/when). Closure is a Decisive Change—the broadcasts stop—with conceptual cost: humanity now knows it’s being played, altering its cosmic stance. However, the resolution leans slightly on summary (“news reports described easing tensions”) rather than dramatized consequence, softening the cost’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each action follows from prior conditions (fallow period, inherited compass, nexus location). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “key” is revealed as a passage, redefining generations of imprisonment—and carries conceptual cost (abandoning her world). The shimmering doorway materializes because of Elara’s humming and the compass, not coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the drive remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elena’s methodical analysis directly leads to the killer. Closure is a Decisive Change (confession) with conceptual cost—community silence broken after 20 years. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who/where/when). However, the climax (“reconstruction led to a confession”) is summarized, not dramatized, weakening the causal payoff despite strong buildup. The ribbon-to-mask-to-assistant chain is tight, but the final turn lacks on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows from prior knowledge (decoded stanzas → hidden panel → activation). Orientation is immediate (Eli at weather station), and closure lands as a Decisive Change—the system awakens—with conceptual cost (challenging scientific consensus). The “reversible exile” concept crystallizes into action, making before/after legible. No causality breaks; the ancestor’s past directly enables present resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: pixelated amnesty reframes reality as malleable through music and mercy, with visible cost—the abandonment of his old life at the pullout. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: scaffold flutters, glass flake, and wind coalesce into a cosmic language that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the final image—Elias ascending alone, leaving notes hanging in air. Orientation is immediate and disorientation functional; pattern taught by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with recurring motifs (currencies, circus train, territorial markers) accruing meaning until the final Conceptual Repricing: “paths circle back… less to do with our steps than with our starting point.” Cost is legible in Elias’s bankruptcy, calm acceptance, and donation of the currency collection. The structure—a single POV, two temporal shards (present confrontation + compressed backstory)—is coherent, and the Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 3. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual weight and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a Causal lens: the telegram triggers telescope observation, which aligns with dream symbols, leading to collaborative decoding. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who: Elara; where: observatory; when: dawn). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): understanding dawns through shared effort, foreclosing isolation with emotional cost implied in “burden heavier than any she had carried alone.” However, the cost isn’t fully dramatized on the page—it’s felt but not shown through sacrifice or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the confession is not words but identity, reweighting the entire premise (“mirrors show nothing”). Cost is legible—the druid draws blood, endures vortex chaos—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with expanding circles deepening understanding. The pattern of six circles is taught early and pays off cohesively. No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s true nature is revealed, reweighting reality/dreams as complementary. Cost is conceptual (loss of old boundaries) and legible in the final image—the visionary’s smile carries earned poise. However, causality falters slightly: the “early future” premise isn’t dramatized as pressure but asserted, weakening the because/therefore chain. The ritual proceeds without meaningful obstacle, reducing stakes despite lyrical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara completes her task, restoring balance at personal cost, crystallizing her role without reversal. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the orchard’s textures deepen until the memory’s absorption reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the tarot card’s weight and the “patch” completed through sacrifice. Orientation is immediate and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered echoes (applause → echo valley → quarry hole) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: value is redefined from monetary to mnemonic. Orientation is immediate and precise. The closure—Marcus sealing the bag with a note—is a Charged Poise: he reclaims agency through ritual authentication, foreclosing despair with visible cost (his continued isolation). The Leeds festival memory functions as earned deepening, not convenient recall.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara departs with purpose, the seed pulsing in response to rising magnetic fields, crystallizing her stance amid generational weight. The spirit’s departure establishes clear causality; analogical thinking drives escalation toward the Pamirs. Cost is felt—the burden of lineage, the risk of madness—but remains conceptual rather than physical. Structure adheres tightly to Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening through layered analogies that reweight the arbor’s reality.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the librarian emerges as a new synthesis, foreclosing fixed identity with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (creel, tide, moon) that reweight meaning at the end. Orientation is clear by line 30; “after tomorrow disappears” functions as a taught temporal rule, not disorientation. Cost is legible in the line: “adds another layer to who we might become tomorrow.”

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the end of the world redefined as disconnection, not catastrophe, with the crown symbolizing invisible but felt responsibility. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (bunker → caves → pearl → shell → crown) until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the inspector’s irreversible shift in perception (“everything looked different”) and ongoing burden (“constant reminder”). Orientation is immediate, pattern-taught by paragraph two, and payoff fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena accepts grief, aligning music with river flow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—graffiti fragments coalesce into emotional and geographic truth. Cost is legible in her tears joining the water, no longer diverted.

The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory fragments and cipher patterns until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is felt in the urgency of the watch’s vibration and the implied loss if the second letter arrives. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the fog-to-library transition is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the violin’s essence lives on in the desert rose while the empire claims a shell. Cost is legible in the “deep scars” of the original and Elara’s enduring “mulberry ache.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and patterned imagery (fractures → perforations → propagation). Orientation is immediate (“velvet observatory at midsummer”), and the coffee-stain prophecy tightens stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and memory-weaving until the static resolves into narrative. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara completes her ritual, the emerald glows, and she turns to the next soul—options crystallized, cost felt (eternal solitude). The aurora intensifies as both amplifier and witness, making the conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation is immediate (“skyborne grotto,” “aurora borealis”), and causality holds via consistent rules of energy, memory, and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara shifts from seeking contentment to becoming its source, with clear cost in sacrificed certainty and burned knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (scallop, moonstones, vineyard hush)—and the grotto’s liminal logic remains consistent. Orientation is firm by line 3; the only flaw is slight compression in the betrayal’s impact, but it serves thematic resonance over causality.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian’s interpretation crystallizes options for the fisherman while revealing his own protected vulnerability, with clear conceptual cost—the burden of holding others’ consciences. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: wind chime selections, mirror shard reflections, and atmospheric details build to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (“breezy lighthouse at dawn”), and causality remains intact through ritualized action rather than plot mechanics. The final image reweights doubt as truth’s companion, fulfilling Conceptual Repricing with emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s vanishing intensifies her presence, reweighting the story’s core paradox with felt cost (Elien’s reversed aging). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ripples, grotto light, tightening skin all deepen meaning without causal breaks. Orientation is clear by line 3; the magnetic grotto’s late reveal pays off early spatial cues.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered echoes, stones, and avian patterns toward a Conceptual Repricing: movement redefined as stillness. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Kael,” “canyon,” “bone towers”), and the closure—a pulsing arrowhead as guide—delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost (Kael’s disappearance). However, the crows’ sudden directional shift functions more as convenient symbol than earned signal, slightly weakening causal integrity. The pulse’s completion of a prehistoric circuit lands with mythic weight, satisfying the RR requirement under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone’s lingering luminance reweights the story’s magical paradigm, proving wonder can’t be automated.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure: the universe folds to rebirth, reweighting all prior dread with hope. However, causality is thin—the backwards prophecy’s mechanics are asserted, not dramatized, making the coin-static correlation feel mystical rather than motivated. The ambered observatory and contraction provide clear orientation early, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural) through sensory density and pattern. Yet the decisive act—inputting coordinates—lacks tangible consequence or visible sacrifice, weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the reaper’s stance shifts from passive grief to active naming, foreclosing eternal sorrow with tangible cost (centuries of pain, loss of Elara). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring motifs (light, names, sacrifice) that culminate in crystallization. Cost is legible: “cloak no longer seemed as heavy” signals earned lightness after burden. Orientation is clear by line 2, and the single shard structure fits the word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell rings with silence that reconfigures sea and sky, and the mage walks away with warming powers—a before/after legible through the final image. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterned dripping intensifies into cosmic realignment via density increase, not causality. Cost is felt—the brittle devotion shattered, now renewed—and the sapphire viaduct’s transformation crystallizes stakes. Orientation anchors (“sapphire viaduct,” “dawn,” “mage”) by line 2; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Thomas redefines the reservoir’s narrative from bureaucratic utility to silenced history, with clear social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the photographs and label accrue meaning until they catalyze action. The wind chime’s silence functions as both temporal marker and symbolic pivot. Cost is legible in his renunciation of complicity, crystallized in the dawn-lit ridgeway stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (crystal, flame, starlings) that converge at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible: Elara achieves harmonization, crystallized in the violet flame and levitating crystal. Yet cost is conceptual rather than felt—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The “final transformation” remains deferred, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final transmission crystallizes stakes, reconfigures celestial data into actionable truth, and carries conceptual cost—trust must be preserved even when patterns collapse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (buckle, static, canopy whispers), culminating in a cadence shift at the decoded message. However, the “Great Storm” backstory isn’t anchored to a present micro-choice, slightly weakening causality under BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: consciousness is redefined as exponential, not zero-sum, with undeniable social cost implied in ongoing custody battles. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered dualities (emptiness/fullness, original/duplicate) until the final image reweights reality itself. History’s rewrite serves as both pressure and payoff, and the dojo’s tremor ties spatial instability to temporal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (brook, seed, silence) toward a Conceptual Repricing: innovation requires patience and unconventional space. Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the planted seed crystallizes Elara’s stance—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no path is visibly foreclosed. The escalation is lyrical, not causal, which fits the lens but limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered sound, memory, and absence until the giggle’s echo triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible in Silas’s frozen sway and engine sigh—laughter isn’t restored, only remembered, foreclosing hope with quiet finality. Orientation anchors (tunnel, house, hourglass) are clear by line 30. The closure image reweights silence as sanctuary, satisfying Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the guardian redefines “home” not as a place but as a state of consciousness, with tangible cost—the abandonment of passive waiting for active navigation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, evidenced by escalating sensory density (mist thickening/thinning, light bending) that reweights the stake of exile into possibility. The pendant’s activation functions as both catalyst and constraint, shaping tactics without resolving via coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern pays off cohesively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines sacredness through transformation, not restoration. The cost—breaking lineage tradition—is legible in the crozier’s dissolution and rebirth. Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through repeated attempts, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. The “penny drops” as quiet certainty, not melodrama, satisfying the lens without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory and conceptual density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure—the realization that “every conclusion contains the seed of a new start.” Cost is legible in the earned silence, the relinquishing of assumptions, and the temporary awakening of the city, which sleeps again after. Orientation is immediate and vivid, with no disorientation penalty. The closure reweights the entire premise without over-explaining, satisfying elite publishability standards.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (hourglass, patterns, radio) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liam becomes whole as timelines merge. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“commuter ferry,” “deckhand Liam,” “harbor”), and the closure delivers conceptual cost—the vanishing ferry now vanishes by choice, altering its fundamental nature. The spectral grotto sequence tightens stakes via converging vessels and interwoven sands, with no causality breaks. A minor deduction for slight vagueness in how the “interconnected patterns” function mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns build until the sinew thread erupts, reweighting the entire premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elias realizes connection is co-created, not discovered, crystallizing options with emotional cost. The erupting tapestry serves as both climax and turning point, with the sister’s reappearance feeling inevitable yet earned. Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and the dream logic remains consistent without retroactive patches.

    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (chain link, starlight, refraction) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: navigation now bridges oceanic and cosmic scales. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“benthic city’s only navigation instructor”), and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the reweighting of human knowledge itself. The breakthrough is dramatized on-page via returned ships confirming Kael’s calculations, avoiding summary. A persistent constraint (three miles of ocean blocking direct starlight) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photograph transforms from memento to evidence, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—the grandmother’s unheeded warning finally fulfilled. The causal lens holds: because Elena uses the hearing aid, she intercepts the threat; therefore, the child is saved. Cost is legible in the hearing aid’s calming pulse and the reframed photo. Orientation is clear by line 30, and escalation tightens options coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara emerges just as the tide reclaims the entrance, crystallizing her eternal return with palpable cost (“cost her friends and career”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—tidal rhythm, gold-fleck glow, and shadow-guiding build density toward a resonant final image. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3, and the 42-minute clock tightens pressure without contrivance. Minor deduction: Dr. Thorne’s backstory arrives late but functions as mythic echo, not causal engine.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “error” reframed as invitation, with cost felt in perpetual liminality (“counting heartbeats… without really knowing I’m still here”).

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via birds, fabrics, echoes until the pattern break at twilight triggers the diamond’s activation. Cost is legible in the storyteller’s wrinkled skin and thirty years of solitude. Orientation anchors instantly (“towers of bone… canyon of endless echoes”), and causality remains tight within the lyric framework.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (arrowhead, frostbitten hope, static phone) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: understanding must metamorphose before coexistence is possible. Orientation is clear by line 3, and closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image of Aris tending hope while the arrowhead mirrors constellations reweights all prior observation with cosmic implication and quiet sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s magic integrates into the mechanical world through Elayn’s music, with crystalline vines on the bridge signaling irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the carpenter’s song unlocks magic, transforming silence into symphony, with clear conceptual cost—the dissolution of the halo fragment and irreversible return to voice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by escalating sensory density (mist → glint → chime → song → light). Structure is single-scene with one decisive turn (wrong door), and orientation anchors are firm by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat flows from prior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (scarf, hyperbolic geometry, analog memories) until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: stories exist in the space between, not on pages. Cost is legible—the scarf dissolves, transferring its memories into Margaret’s soul—and the library itself reconfigures. Orientation is immediate (“three in the morning,” “scientific poetry library”), and the hyperbolic gateway’s glow signals a decisive turn. The only flaw: the “seven books” detail feels ornamental rather than causally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images, recurring objects, and cadence shifts toward dawn. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elara reinterprets her sister’s disappearance as transformation—and cost is legible in “tears blurred her vision” and the lifelong labor of predawn vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s self is restored via Earned Stasis—she endures the liminal space to reclaim memories. Cost is legible in the shipwrecks’ “sigh” and the fairy ring’s dimming, implying ecological reciprocity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks (pulsing ring, realigning stars) intensify pressure coherently. Orientation anchors instantly (“sunken orchard greenhouse”), and causality remains tight—no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Prisha’s stance crystallizes the theme of resilience, foreclosing passive apprenticeship with visible cost—the library becomes her sanctuary while the archivist accepts his exile’s purpose. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure intensifying via sensory density (tea leaves, shadow, shard) until the final image reweights meaning. The playground swing bookends time and stakes cohesively. Cost is legible: the archivist’s irreversible separation from the Royal Archives is transmuted into legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transformed seed pulses with preserved wonder, and the pruner endures as guardian, foreclosing personal closure for generational legacy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in the rainbow-casting seed. Cost is legible in the pouch-bound seed and the pruner’s solitude, though the “giving pieces of oneself” remains conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by midpoint and held: silence accrues like dust, then becomes woven, then stillness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where both spirits and Elena achieve peace through a decisive act—unraveling the net—with visible cost (Jacob’s lifelong burden lifted, Elena’s partial mending). The final image of starlight casting “mended masks” reweights the entire premise with emotional and conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored crisply within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the henge isn’t physical but celestial, reweighting all prior effort into a sacred epiphany. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered footage analysis until the rain-scoured vault climax reveals the tear’s alignment with a constellation. Cost is legible in Elara’s renunciation of mapping the unknowable; the repaired tear becomes a charged symbol of respect, not conquest. Orientation anchors instantly (“rain-scoured fresco vault,” “map framer”), and causality remains tight through her methodical process.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (snow globe, water, frequency) until the final Conceptual Repricing: death as a “frequency shift.” Closure lands decisively on-page with legible conceptual cost—Amelia’s plane vanishes, Elara’s tears fall, and she commits to helping others grieve. The snow globe’s transformation functions as both motif and mechanism, reweighting the entire premise without exposition. Orientation is anchored cleanly within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images (graffiti, storms, the bolt plate) rather than causal turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent song continues, crystallizing their bond with felt cost—Elara’s songs remain “seldom-heard” by humans. Orientation is immediate (“ethereal realm between lightning and thunder”), and the pattern is taught early. However, the escalation lacks a decisive intensification; the dance of light and color deepens but doesn’t narrow options or raise stakes beyond initial parameters.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with elevator floors structuring a lyrical ascent that deepens thematic pressure. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Elira reweights duty and affection through the decoded truth. Cost is legible in her silent promise and descent—a Charged Poise crystallizing service as sacred witness. Orientation is clear by line 2; pattern taught early and paid off flawlessly at floor ten.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through cloud observations that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the sky as living archive. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—the gondola suspended, Elena no longer stranded but “exactly where she needed to be”—with conceptual cost (professional skepticism overcome by revelation). Orientation is clear by line 3 (“sky gondola,” “Dr. Elena Vasquez”), and the pattern of emotional cloud categorization pays off cohesively. No causality breaks; the lens holds tightly through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where sensory density and pattern accrual reweight the stake from preserving architecture to mapping human connection. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “sky” becomes a metaphor for relational constellations, charged by the imminent demolition. Cost is legible in Elara’s irreversible act—creating art only she can fully interpret, just before the library vanishes. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns deepen until the hopscotch cipher aligns with starlings and luminance, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—light can be mapped. Closure lands via CR with conceptual cost (a new scientific paradigm), though the “stranded luminance” resolution leans on coincidence rather than causal agency. Orientation is solid by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (driftwood, mirrors, gears) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias joins his ancestors in the “eternal rhythm of repair.” Cost is legible in the final image—his individual quest dissolves into lineage, foreclosing solitary mastery. Orientation is anchored immediately (“frozen library above clouds”), and the closure reweights all prior imagery without exposition. The only flaw: the prophecy’s role feels decorative rather than causal, slightly weakening escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated chalk messages build density until the watering bell’s discovery triggers a Conceptual Repricing (CR) closure—the community reweights cooperation as sacred. Cost is legible in the “brambled hope” that acknowledges setbacks, and the final solstice message crystallizes Charged Poise. However, causality leans on convenience: the bell appears precisely when needed, with no prior failure or misstep to earn its revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias secures continuity not by halting entropy but by weaving fragility into the clock’s core, foreclosing any path of surrender. The “pane of hush” setting and fractured puppet head constrain tactics throughout, and cost is legible in his bone-deep exhaustion and the clock’s shuddering resistance. Orientation is immediate (“hidden lighthouse at dusk”), stakes coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shift from tension to resonant quiet marking decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Elias finds the nut and blueprint, he builds the device; because he enters the labyrinth, he leaves impressions; because frost approaches, urgency tightens choices. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias accepts his role not as burden but purpose—with conceptual cost (spent nut, solitude) legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate (“cursed orchard,” “twilight”), and the single POV maintains clean causality. One flaw: the mechanical birds’ sudden irrelevance at escape lacks minor justification, slightly softening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with the braided ravine, chrysalis, and foam patterns building a resonant motif system that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: separation as potential for reconnection. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands via Charged Poise—the phone call crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (years of estrangement). The cost is legible in the sister’s silence-turned-laugh and Elara’s reframing of the chrysalis. No causality breaks; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: stories begin not in a place but “in the spaces between what was said and what remained unspoken,” reweighting the entire premise with conceptual cost (abandoning the quest for origin). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of bottled moonlight, memory shards, and glass orchard builds to a cadence shift at the door-creation. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“clean slate vendor,” “glass orchard library,” “first opening day”). The visitor’s arrival crystallizes Charged Poise: options (creation vs. repair) and stakes (parole compliance) become legible without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: tidal patterns, brittle surfaces, and layered regret build density until Kael’s ritual reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—his heart is lighter, yet the pavilion’s walls remain brittle, implying ongoing fragility—and cost is legible in his trembling hands. Orientation is clear by line 3; the dream-frame and rain-anchored setting serve functional disorientation that pays off in the pavilion’s emergence. One tightening (the descent into memory-pool) suffices for this length, and causality remains intact despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered gatherings, language use, and symbolic resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community’s rhythm is restored. The cuckoo weight’s reintroduction charges the final image with cost—the effort to rebuild literal and social bridges. Orientation is solid by line 30. However, the escalation relies on summary (“by the fourth meeting…”) rather than dramatized beats, softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the broken mirror reweights abandonment as potential, with clear emotional cost (tears, quaking reverie). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through spiraling imagery and layered memories—but the inciting activation lacks tangible resistance; the device works immediately without failure or adaptation, softening escalation. Still, the final image crystallizes a new relationship to memory with resonant poise.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because gravity inverts, Elara enters the grotto; because she fulfills threshold effects, she unlocks the seeds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she returns changed, bearing renewed responsibility, with the cost being lifelong vigilance. However, the second half repeats setup details (“gravity inverts,” “seeds of vigilance”) rather than escalating pressure, slightly diluting momentum. The 60-minute clock tightens stakes, but the seven-minute escape lacks on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through sensory layering and patterned detail until the final Charged Poise: Elara’s readiness to carve anew. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing—the rediscovered song reweights silence from void to vessel—and cost is legible in the tears and historical grief absorbed. Orientation is immediate (“siskin alder grove,” “Elara”), and the single scene coheres tightly. The porcelain insulator’s function as conduit pays off the taught system without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: magnetic pulses, sky patterns, and notebook diagrams accrue meaning until the climax reweights the covenant as partnership, not penance—a valid Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible in Elias’s exile, exhaustion, and relinquished identity, crystallized when he places the stone at twilight. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who/where/when), and the three-day countdown tightens pressure coherently. Closure lands with resonant finality and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure: silence frequencies layer into a resonant harmony that unlocks the diary. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the diary reframes her life’s work not as end but beginning—with felt cost in her tears and shifted calling. The “final stillness before fireworks” functions as both temporal pressure and poetic cadence shift. Every beat contributes to the crescendo without redundancy or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes as keeper of wisdom, with felt cost in abandoned ambition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—doodles, scents, and light patterns deepen into a language of understanding. “At the turning of the tide’s thought” functions as a rhythmic cadence shift, not a causal clock, which fits the design. No causality breaks; the seed’s revelation reweights the entire premise without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because gravity inverts, Arion navigates by water; because he enters the First Arch, echoes reveal origins; because of the arrow tip, he understands resilience. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the planet’s survival through earned knowledge. Cost is legible: the mission’s urgency, physical danger, and ancestral burden crystallize in the cold arrow tip against his skin. Orientation is solid by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a compelling mystery with strong atmospheric pressure and a coherent investigative arc. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: Elena accepts ambiguity while pursuing models to prevent future catastrophe—cost is felt in the town’s mass unconsciousness and her isolation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by density of wind data, spatial anomalies, and the final crystallization of purpose. However, the phenomenon’s mechanics remain under-dramatized, relying on assertion over causal demonstration, slightly softening the closure’s inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through synesthetic layering until the sculpted hush reconfigures silence itself—a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: the audience’s prior numbness is shattered by wonder made manifest. Orientation is immediate (“glacial cathedral,” “last known prism-song bell ringer”), and the aurora’s timing tightly binds action to cosmic rhythm. The closure lands with resonant force: tears of joy prove wonder’s necessity, fulfilling the premise without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density, patterned ritual, and cadence shifts that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: Eldrin reweights guardianship as healing, not control. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when by line 3), and closure lands with undeniable cost—tears washing away guilt, flute now “lighter, yet more precious.” The spiral arrangement and flute sequences function as taught structural beats, not causal turns, but cohere perfectly under this lens. One hairline slip: the “forbidden temple texts” lack earlier anchoring, slightly muddying the spiral’s origin.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s worldview—that emotion follows cosmic, quantifiable laws—is reinforced even as she breaches ethical boundaries. The vanishing stars function as both literal clock and metaphorical ledger, charging the final image with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory detail, borrowed trait, and vanished star deepens the thematic pressure without requiring plot turns. The workshop’s shifting geometry and halo’s pulse serve as pattern-taught disorientation that pays off in Thomas’s panic and Elara’s cold analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Ayla realizes wonder isn’t delivered but awakened—a reweighting of the entire premise with emotional cost (her jitters replaced by confidence, the pendant gone). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated vibrations build density until shoots bloom in her wake, culminating in Charged Poise at the ridgeway’s edge. Orientation is immediate (“aurora-lit ridgeway”), stakes clear (deliver before solstice), and causality flows via sympathetic vibration. One flaw: the elder’s role is passive, reducing relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: frost patterns, quartz hum, and prism warmth layer toward a Conceptual Repricing—objects preserve full experiential moments, not just emotions. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (her life’s work was too narrow), and the final image of Elara stepping out reborn carries Charged Poise. However, the “timeframe when assumptions shatter” is stated twice without dramatizing temporal pressure, slightly weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the silence reverses, sound returns, and Elara’s role transforms—fulfilling a Conceptual Repricing that redefines silence as “a different kind of presence.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with sensory losses building density until the bead’s pulse triggers action. Cost is legible in each sacrificed memory and the bead’s dimming glow. The puzzle-path structure is taught early and pays off cohesively at the ancient bamboo shoot.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (azure light, rubble, silence) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: true resilience lies in repair, not avoidance. Closure lands decisively—the final image of travelers feeling Orion’s echo reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (his essence traded, his silence given). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite minimal plot, as each beat intensifies thematic density rather than external events. The cost—his "silence, time, and very essence"—is legible in the charged poise of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map maker stands ready at the mysterious door, power spent but resolve intensified—a crystallized moment where stakes, options, and cost are legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterned transitions taught early and reinforced via cyclic spontaneity. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when anchored by line 3), and the dream-state climax pays off the opening murmurs. Cost is felt in the shard’s dimming and receding revelations, though the “weight” of truth remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (sea glass, stones, letters) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the light is no longer just a beacon but a vessel of intergenerational fellowship. Cost is legible in Elias’s quiet surrender of total solitude—his name enters an anonymous chain, foreclosing pure independence. Orientation is immediate (“lighthouse supply skipper,” “island lighthouse”), and the lamp’s failure cleanly triggers discovery. Closure lands with Charged Poise: he chooses continuity, and the re-lit lamp carries ancestral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s final act crystallizes her role amid uncertainty, with visible cost in her worry over misprediction. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through recurring emerald light, manuscripts, and migration charts, culminating in fleet guidance. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite prophecy’s convenience because it stems from established intuition. One tightening occurs when twin comets validate her laugh, raising stakes for the refugee fleet.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (morpho wing, prisms, sun trails) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: narrative magnetism stems from iridescent perspective, not volume. Closure is earned via Kaelen’s synthesis of dye, light, and human observation, with conceptual cost—the acceptance that truth is refracted, not fixed—made legible in the final image of adaptive storytelling. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (moonlight, storm, oak board) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is immediate (“Samuel polished brass gears in the stormlit astronomy tower”), and causality remains intact through resonant triggers (pin chime aligning with dream frequency). The decisive shift—Samuel understanding trees’ patient witness of sorrow—carries conceptual cost: his work reframed from burden to sanctuary-keeping. Every beat feeds this reconfiguration without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper fulfills their purpose and rests as the realm awakens, with visible cost in their tremors and scattered psyche realigning. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure intensifies via rhythmic deepening (humming → stronger song → pulsing walls) rather than causal turns. The mica window’s evolving reflection signals change without exposition. Cost is legible in the keeper’s exhaustion and the irreversible binding of self to communal restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Eleanor’s choice to “stay while leaving” forecloses social integration but affirms her authentic self, with clear emotional cost. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density of paradox imagery builds to a resonant reconfiguration at midnight. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality remains coherent despite reflective passages. The crumpled invitation’s arc provides a tight causal throughline from discovery to closure gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the vanished bakers’ sacrifice reweights Eliza’s understanding of disappearance from loss to protection, charging the final image with social and emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds through sensory density and patterned returns (bread, garden, tea house)—and the final act (reading the letter aloud, leaving the bread) crystallizes meaning without mechanical resolution. The rain and garden renewal provide earned stasis with visible cost: Eliza relinquishes possession to extend care.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated phrases (“quartz hush,” “conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion”) build density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias’s renewed purpose amid fading vows. Orientation is strong by line 30; the frozen library, Elias, and his task are vividly anchored. The closure lands with conceptual cost: preservation is possible, but only through relentless labor, and many vows are already lost. One meaningful deepening occurs—the discovery that reinforcement is feasible—which reweights the stake without violating causality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the captured “silence that screams” reweights the entire premise by making betrayal an audible artifact. The causal chain is tight—each false start escalates pressure until Malachi’s note triggers the fracture Eliza needs. The sunrise deadline creates urgency without coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is legible in the final image: Eliza possesses the sound, but the market’s fragile peace is shattered, and her isolation is affirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist realizes they’re not an observer but a selected carrier, reweighting the entire premise. Cost is legible in the compass dissolving into skin and the aurora “declaring a result”—a visible, irreversible shift. Orientation anchors instantly (“lavender bluff under the aurora”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (taste, vibration, light) until convergence crystallizes meaning. The forest elections motif pays off structurally, not just thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated images (charcoal, crystals, echoes) intensify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Rhodes’ stance crystallizes not through action but through reclaimed perception. Cost is legible: years of creative suppression paid in “auroral sorrow,” now transmuted into creation. The crystal cave’s return frames a before/after with emotional weight, though the inciting discovery (cleaning woman’s remark) borders on convenient coincidence that complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s realization that authenticity—not cleverness—is the key to The Repository crystallizes stakes and reconfigures her entire approach, with felt cost (loneliness, ostracization) legible in her preparation at dawn. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring artifacts and truthful moments until the map and plate “glow” together, reweighting meaning. Orientation is immediate (“glass-domed workshop,” “toxic sky”), and causality flows via discovery → insight → commitment. No coincidences resolve pressure; every turn stems from Elara’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering until the iceberg fragment’s arrival triggers a cadence shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s death reweights the entire premise by immortalizing “wonder” as resonant light, with undeniable conceptual cost (words truly unnecessary). The Orientation Test is waived—the early disorientation (“above the clouds”) pays off in the closure image. Cost is legible in the final pulse of “colors never before seen,” marking irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via fragmentation): Unit 734 endures by dividing, foreclosing its singular existence to preserve the garden. Cost is legible in the slumped original body and empty fear-box. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies through sensory distortion, wilting roses, and system fractures until miniaturization crystallizes meaning. Every beat tightens toward this charged poise without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: neighborhood fragments coalesce into collective memory, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—listening as communal healing. Closure lands decisively with Eliza’s letters reweighting the locket’s meaning and Leo’s role. Cost is legible: the threat of demolition gives urgency, and the final image of shared reading shows emotional reconnection earned through accumulated testimony. Orientation is clear by line 30; pattern taught early via courtyard vignettes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (spider’s web, dice, dance). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: knowledge is redefined as embodied, not textual. Yet the climax lacks felt cost—systems awaken effortlessly, and Lydia’s appearance introduces a second character without pressure or consequence. The “decisive change” is asserted, not dramatized with stakes tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns intensify (gravity fluctuations → neural pathways → coffee grounds → crystal visions), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“nothing was ever truly lost, only transformed.” Closure lands with conceptual cost: Elara accepts she cannot retrieve memories, only commune with them. The whale’s beaching initiates the pattern; the salt crystal’s discovery crystallizes it. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30, and the single shard structure fits 600–800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through layered sensory and ritualistic detail, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the prophecy is contained and released. The closure is on-page, with conceptual cost implied by the summoner’s exhaustion and the crane’s transformation. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening of options—ritual steps unfold predictably without meaningful complication or trade-off that alters tactics. The “mapping silence” method never faces resistance, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of symbols, weekly rituals, and meteoric light deepen until the rooftop climax reweights everything as ancestral inheritance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the buildings shift from mystery to “old friends”—with clear cost: Clara now bears responsibility for a silenced lineage. The desk seal’s glow during the meteor shower crystallizes this shift visually and thematically. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality remains intact despite lyrical pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts mystery while retaining reason, crystallizing her new role as archivist. The cost—bearing quarantined memories alone—is legible in the final image of her walking away with shell at heart. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via sensory layering and emotional resonance until dawn reweights everything. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias renounces forgery, accepts public exposure, and steps into the world—a decisive break from isolation. Cost is legible: years of penance, loss of name, and the irreversible act of confession. The causal lens holds—key unlocks truth because he seeks redemption—and the stone dissolving pays off cleanly. Orientation anchors early (“marble sanctuary,” “Elias Thorne”) and serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the singer’s stance shifts from observer to healer, crystallizing options for the spirit and herself. Cost is legible in the lifting yet transformed melancholy and the silent shell—symbols of fulfilled purpose and personal change. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterned phrases (“while the universe hummed…”) gaining weight through cadence shifts. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s shrine moment crystallizes justice-as-healing, reweighting the entire narrative. The causal lens holds—each discovery leads because/therefore to the next, culminating in descendants’ voluntary confessions. Cost is legible in the captain’s release and the snow globe’s transformation. Orientation anchors instantly (“frigid waters,” “wreck-diver gear”), and the two-shard structure (ocean → glacier) transitions cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (nets, fireflies, moon paths) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that wisdom lies in noticing the unnoticeable. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the acceptance of impermanence and invisibility as inherent to meaning—and the moon paths’ ephemerality reinforces this. The structure is taut, with early anchoring (“cabin by the river,” “net-mender”) and a single, resonant shard that deepens without digression.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who/where/when by line 3) and follows a causal drive lens: discovery → assembly → revelation → decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya chooses to protect and disseminate truth without exposing the stillpoint, crystallizing stakes under storm pressure. Cost is felt (“fate worse than liquidation”) but not yet paid; however, the final image makes consequence undeniable. One tightening—reassembling letters—narrows options decisively and alters knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (storms, static, cobalt glass) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: truth resides in noise, not declaration. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“stormlit observatory above clouds”), and closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias watches history unfold per his interpretations, smiling amid ongoing transmissions. Cost is conceptual (irrelevance of traditional authority) but legible. No causality breaks, though escalation relies on reportage (“they brought news”) rather than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the room’s transformation into a “chorus of shared memory” reconfigures intergenerational silence into connection, with visible cost—the poet’s continued vagrancy despite profound impact. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds until the music box’s melody breaks the pattern, shifting cadence and meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“vagrant penny poet,” “feral loft beneath the dunes,” “dawn”). No causality breaks; every beat flows from established rules of his sound-capturing world.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elias’s inherited knowledge → vibrational ritual → sonic defense forms a tight because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he renews protection and accepts lifelong duty, with visible cost in the intruders’ defeat and his solitude. The crypt keeper’s key warming and the orb’s pulse provide on-page signals of distress and resolution, satisfying cost proof. Orientation is immediate and stable; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the revolution’s success is redefined not as action but as resonance, with the cost being generations of deferred impact. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and patterned imagery (moon paths, magnetic hum, cracking ice). The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 3. One tightening occurs at moonrise, when theory becomes confirmation, narrowing future tactics to sharing findings.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a Causal lens: each discovery (scratches, note, fibers) logically tightens pressure and reweights stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya’s decision to submit findings crystallizes options with career risk as felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; timeline inconsistencies (water levels vs. drought end) are intentional clues, not flaws. The lantern’s dual historical/present function drives causality without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows from prior choices (retirement → heart stops → search for repair → revelation of letter → decision to act). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the priest chooses not to fix the heart because justice now lies in action, not symbol. Cost is legible in the final image—the silence of the heart “speaking more loudly”—and the pension sacrificed for the house. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the unheard bell’s vibration reconfigures meaning, with felt cost in the glider’s recalibrated yearning. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—patterns of curiosity, symbols, and reflection intensify toward a cadence shift at the bell’s ringing. Orientation is immediate (“workshop floor,” “acid sea”), and the single shard structure fits scope. The acid sea pausing offers conceptual cost, making the before/after legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building tension through layered digital ghosts, recurring numbers, and fragmented clues that coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing: deleted files don’t vanish—they’re hidden everywhere. The closure lands with Charged Poise—Elara disappears into the underground, evidence in hand, cost felt in career and freedom foregone. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact via pattern recognition rather than linear cause-effect. Minor deduction: the security alarm climax leans slightly telegraphic, compressing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the reconstituted crystal embodies empathy made manifest, with conceptual cost legible in the elders’ looming skepticism. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of mirror-glimpses, shadow choreography, and orchard imagery coalesce into a decisive cadence shift at climax. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; causality remains intact despite non-linear method. The weighted breath motif tightens stakes without false resets.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and thematic density intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elena reweights “endings” as portals to beginnings. The closure is resonant and earned—the parasol tip shifts from farewell token to anchor of continuity. Cost is legible in her frozen tears and renunciation of euthanasia, though the inciting “waking up changed” remains under-dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure adheres to scope defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but fails to deliver a decisive intensification: the “final bus departs” motif repeats without escalating pressure or narrowing options. Closure attempts Charged Poise (“connection existed in the spaces between people”), yet cost is asserted, not dramatized—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The Orientation Test passes early, but the repetitive structure (three near-identical “after the final bus…” refrains) creates stagnation, not deepening. The ending reasserts theme without reconfiguring stakes through concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the conjured clearing endures as wisdom’s vessel while the line walker departs into solitude—a legible before/after with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: murmuring intensifies, parapet resonates, light-circle emerges, all deepening pressure toward consecration. Every beat links via sensory escalation, not causality, fitting the lyric design. Cost is unmistakable in “continuity with the past meant isolation in the present.”

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and patterned ritual deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the factory shifts from decay to resilience, pain becomes shared understanding. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. However, the “ritual” lacks causal mechanics; healing occurs by atmospheric osmosis rather than dramatized consequence, weakening cost legibility despite a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (crystal, hush, fractals) until the climax—a pure tone that lifts dust like spirits—delivers a Conceptual Repricing: language transforms, not dies. The closure is resonant and charged, with clear conceptual cost (the world’s obliviousness, the scholar’s solitude). Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality is maintained through sensory cause/effect (humming → echoes, whispering → vibration). The only flaw: the crystal’s properties are discovered “by accident,” a minor reliance on coincidence that doesn’t resolve but introduces the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each driftwood placement layers memory, each chalk stroke intensifies resonance, culminating in the arch’s hum—a Conceptual Repricing where “the sound of growing older” shifts from abstract longing to tangible, layered sigh. Orientation is immediate (“junkyard prophet,” “fog sculpture garden”), and the closure lands as Earned Stasis—he accepts transience yet chooses to memorialize it, then walks away alone. Cost is legible in the final image: the caretaker vanishes, the sound fades, but he arranges markers for home, bearing the weight of a memory already half-lost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the observatory’s “shaking” is reframed not as malfunction but as attunement to hidden frequencies, with tangible cost—the abandonment of conventional stabilization. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each descriptive layer builds toward the luminous final image. The golden clock’s behavior pays off causally, and the head astronomer’s shift from skepticism to wonder validates Elara’s method without resolving conflict artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the son holding the broken vinyl while the therapist plays reconfigures loss into continuity, with palpable cost in what cannot be undone. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—scent, sound, and object layer to intensify meaning—and the pattern is taught early (“scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”). The blood work timeframe tightens stakes without mechanical ticking, and the final image (“space between notes where love lives on”) reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost. No causality breaks; every beat serves the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: shadows “go nowhere and everywhere,” reweighting reality’s rules with conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of rune loops builds to a cadence shift at climax. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality holds despite surreal premise. Minor deduction for lack of tangible consequence beyond insight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boundary softens, hands join, and a constellation becomes legible—foreclosing pure certainty while offering renewal. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with escalating sensory density (tooth’s hum, blurred edges, dissolving maze) reweighting stakes. Cost is felt in Eleanor’s yielded skepticism and Arthur’s shrewd vulnerability. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts her earthbound role and transforms limitation into purpose, with visible emotional cost (“burned dreams to ash”) and social payoff (pilgrims arriving). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—patterns of light, memory, and craft intensify toward a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The “pearl of stillness” crystallizes a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured without physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: truth-telling transforms from exposure into generative soil, with moss enveloping guilt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns (icicle spiral, moss growth) deepen meaning without causal turns. Cost is legible in the pendant’s surrender and the viral confession’s lingering shadow. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shell fragment reweights the novel as “both broken and complete,” charging fiction with emotional truth. However, cost remains conceptual—no on-page forfeiture, time loss, or relational rupture makes the price legible. The Orientation Test passes early (who/where/when clear by line 3), but escalation lacks a tightening that narrows options; pressure diffuses into misty introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory density (glowing vine, dawn light, moonlit notes) and patterned recurrence (verdant arbor, harvest moon, forgotten songs). Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—when villagers remember who they are, reconfiguring communal identity with palpable cost: generations of loss now acknowledged. The vine’s transformation and the moon’s alignment serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics. Every beat tightens toward this lyrical crescendo without causal breaks or disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard glows, hope reborn, with conceptual cost implied in the risk of failure (“lost to the void forever”).

The final image reweights prior stillness into active salvation, satisfying the cost proof test through palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: Elara’s daily mapping builds toward a Conceptual Repricing where echoes become storable wonder. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the timer’s reactivation crystallizes past/present connection with undeniable cost (the “wounded season” as temporal scar). Orientation is immediate and precise; causality emerges through pattern recognition, not mechanical repair. The historian’s early advice (“reverse-engineer it entirely”) seeds the solution without telegraphing it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the weaver’s understanding of their role shifts from curse to witness, reweighting all prior burdens with purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through layered silences, calcifying weights, and starlight alignment—and cost is legible in the final line: “spirit burned with collected light” implies perpetual duty. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The ancient civilization vision crystallizes the thematic turn without convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s final act of making tea after placing the serene lion on the mantel crystallizes her stance—holding loss differently, not letting go. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure intensifies via sensory density (rain, wood grain, kettle’s whistle) until the final image reweights all prior motifs. Cost is legible in the carved lion’s closed eyes—peace replacing performance—and the untouched hot water, symbolizing suspended ritual. No causality breaks; every beat accrues toward this resonant stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragmented memories, overheard phrases, and shimmering debris coalesce into a bridge of words that enables closure. The Decisive Change—Cyrus merging with his ghost as the carousel restarts—is earned through precise buildup and lands with conceptual cost (abandoning the past to embrace fluid time). Orientation is immediate (“kinetic lagoon above the clouds”), and the fractured stillness pays off in the “liquid peace” of the ending, satisfying the Closure Gate with resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal becomes a tool for navigating hope, not just space, with the sextant’s inscriptions reweighting Maya’s project. The Causal lens holds—each action follows from prior knowledge and choice—and the cost (years of neglect overcome by solitary labor) is legible in flickering lights and corroded circuits. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport… after the carnival left”), and escalation tightens cleanly toward the switch-throw climax.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines timekeeping from mechanical precision to emotional resonance, with visible cost (decades of abandonment). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—crystal hum intensifies through sensory layering, not causal links. Hidden sunrise timeframe tightens pressure organically; bear’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve, preserving earned agency. Pocket watch offering crystallizes stakes without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery and thematic resonance rather than causal turns. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets the sundial as a metaphor for perspective-dependent truth, crystallizing her mission. Cost is legible—not in material loss but in the burden of inherited knowledge and the irreversible shift from seeker to teacher. The canal setting and journal discovery serve as coherent pressure points that deepen rather than complicate the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the knotted rope reconfigures knowledge into actionable wisdom, with the fog-parting path implying forward momentum at the cost of solitude and responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (snow, fog, rope) until the knot demonstration crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clear by line 30: who (copyist), where (ember alcove), when (post-famine night). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (ink, mist, dust shimmer) and cadence shifts toward broadcast climax. Closure is Charged Poise: her quiet walk home crystallizes stakes (stories as water) with conceptual cost (a world relearning how to dream). Dust’s role as invisible carrier pays off the early archive discovery, satisfying pattern coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (porcelain shards, ash, rocking chair) until the final crystallization of understanding. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: Elena realizes safety lies in process, not completion—a shift earned by the chair’s cessation and her tactile engagement with the mask. Cost is legible in the “weight” and “power” of the mask, and the foreclosed path of seeking solidity. The structure is coherent, though the transition from reverie to action lacks a decisive tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each layer of silt, each preserved artifact, builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the chronometer cog reframes “dangerous knowledge” as essential wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Martin reweights his entire premise of necessary deception upon discovering the carving. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through repeated motifs (watch hand, carvings, “sieved hush”) until the pattern breaks with the grandfather’s initials. Cost is legible in tears, renunciation of livelihood, and the tide-washed pairing of objects. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the moonlit exchange crystallizes a new relational stance between apology and forgiveness, with visible cost in decades of resentment relinquished. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (moon phases, drawer pull, mist) until the final image reweights their meaning. Orientation is solid by line 30. One flaw: the “warmth” of the pull when moon phases align introduces a rule not dramatized earlier, slightly undermining causal integrity at the climax.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena shifts from broken navigator to student of the sea, reweighting the compass from albatross to guide. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through sensory detail, reflection, and symbolic recurrence, culminating in a Charged Poise where cost (lost reputation, professional exile) is felt but not resolved. The Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 3. One tightening occurs: the job offer withdrawal forces reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the looped journey reweights time, memory, and empathy as interdependent forces, with clear conceptual cost (eternal recurrence as burden and duty). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterns in newspaper, symbols, bioluminescence coalesce into a resonant whole. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but pays off functionally at closure (“waiver” applies). The causal chain from baseball → newspaper → tunnels → younger self holds with poetic logic, though the time-loop mechanics lean on implication over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eliora achieves Charged Poise—“transformed yet fundamentally unchanged”—with conceptual cost (loss of full humanity) legible in her rooted feet and starlit eyes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density (spices, moonlight, glyphs) builds to a cadence shift at the exhale that reweights longing into language. The phoenix’s aftermath tightens stakes early and enables the gateway. Every beat serves the arc; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that lost time accumulates in unobserved moments reframes the entire quest with palpable cost—the irreversible slip of early motherhood. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered birthday glimpses, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact though stakes tighten more thematically than tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: compassion unlocks transcendence where violence failed, reweighting humanity’s legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered images (tears, photographs, stitching) culminating in the dimensional bridge. Orientation is clear by line 3; the recycled ship, Eli’s physiology, and Kwan yin’s tear cohere. Final image crystallizes a before/after: extinction vs. compassionate continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Ian shifts from observer to agent, with cost legible in his surrender of control and relics. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring images (bugs, black sand, hush) culminating in a cadence shift at release. Orientation is solid by line 30; celestial alignment functions as taught pattern, not deus ex machina. However, the prophecy fulfillment leans on coincidence resolving rather than complicating, slightly undermining causal integrity under a hybrid reading.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed sundial reconfigures options for initiates while Elias resumes his post, crystallizing stakes with conceptual cost (surveillance vs. silent transmission). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of coded imagery intensifies through brushstrokes, blackout timing, and quill mechanics. Cost is legible in the final image: revolution hinges on undetected artistry. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sacred patterns are not to be controlled but harmonized with, reweighting the story’s rule-set with conceptual cost (abandoning agency for attunement). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via stone placements, star dust pulses, and eel alignments until the aurora-fused climax. Cost is legible in the vial’s integration into consciousness and the relinquishment of predictive torment. Orientation anchors firmly by line 20, and the single scene adheres to scope defaults without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (scars, clouds, lightning) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: truth as rarefied air that seeps through control. Orientation is immediate and stable—“censored poet,” “stormlit observatory,” “Great Suppression”—with no disorientation penalty. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Maia’s final act crystallizes her purpose (“cartography of scars”) with conceptual cost (silence endured, history erased). The darkroom timer’s cadence ties thunder, heartbeat, and resistance into a resonant reconfiguration that feels earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: prismatic light, murmuring brook, and coded objects layer into a resonant reconfiguration at closure—Charged Poise where waiting becomes revelation. Cost is legible: time spent decoding yields coordinates, and the student’s comprehension replaces isolation with shared insight. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality isn’t required, but pattern intensifies meaningfully. The hidden overture’s decoding feels earned through sustained attention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through layered images—pressed flowers, banned poems, rusted shelves—that coalesce into a Charged Poise closure: the poet rebuilding “Collapsed Literature” as stars illuminate decay. Cost is legible in every beat: lost memories, Elias’s absence, the ever-shifting self. The Orientation Test is waived—the disorientation of molting identities serves the final image of luminous fracture. One decisive deepening occurs: the revelation that seeds, not just poems, are weapons of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pianist steps into liminal space, reconfiguring time’s rules while carrying emotional cost—his return promises healing but not reversal. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure escalating via sensory and temporal density (flickering compasses, deepening horizon, backward-ticking clock) rather than causal chain. All anchors are clear by line 30, and the film-reel mechanism pays off a pattern taught early. Cost is legible in the final image: he returns changed, bearing “the promise that some broken things… can be made whole,” implying irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s act reconfigures cultural memory with conceptual cost (fading traditions restored at the edge of monsoon). The causal lens holds—dream interpretation → waterfall cave → ritual—but the ancestors’ sudden vocal intervention borders on deus ex machina, slightly undermining earned causality. Orientation is solid from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass pointing to his heart and glowing with “the color of unspoken apologies” reweights remembrance as internal reconciliation, not external quest. Cost is legible in “cerulean regret lifting” and the admission “I never told her how the waves reminded me of her eyes.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via lace patterns, bonsai, compass—and the spiral motif pays off causally. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.
